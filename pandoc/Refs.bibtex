Although sensory afferents certainly establish the basic receptive field properties of thalamic neurons, increasing evidence indicates that feedback from the cortex plays a crucial role in shaping thalamic responses. Here, we review recent work on the corticothalamic pathways associated with the visual, auditory, and somatosensory systems. Collectively, these studies demonstrate that sensory responses of thalamic neurons result from dynamic interactions between feedforward and feedback pathways.},

This form of suppression likely plays an important role in adjusting the gain of LGN responses to visual stimuli. We performed experiments in alert and anesthetized macaque monkies to quantify extraclassical suppression in the LGN and determine the roles of feedforward and feedback pathways in the generation of LGN suppression. Results show that suppression is significantly stronger among magnocellular neurons than parvocellular neurons and that suppression arises too quickly for involvement from cortical feedback. Furthermore, the amount of suppression supplied by the retina is not significantly different from that in the LGN. These results indicate that extraclassical suppression in the macaque LGN relies on feedforward mechanisms and suggest that suppression in the cortex likely includes a component established in the retina.},

abstract = {Feedback connections to early-level sensory neurons have been shown to affect many characteristics of their neural response. Because selectivity for stimulus size is a fundamental property of visual neurons, we examined the summation tuning and discretely mapped receptive field (RF) properties of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) both with and without feedback from visual cortex. Using extracellular recording in halothane-anesthetized cats, we used small luminance probes displaced in Cartesian coordinates to measure discrete response area, and optimal sinusoidal gratings of varying diameter to estimate preferred optimal summation size and level of center-surround antagonism. In conditions where most cortical feedback was pharmacologically removed, discretely mapped RF response areas showed an overall significant enlargement for the population compared with control conditions. A switch to increased levels of burst firing, spatially displaced from the RF center, suggested this was mediated by changes in excitatory-inhibitory balance across visual space. With the use of coextensive stimulation, there were overall highly significant increases in the optimal summation size and reduction of surround antagonism with removal of cortical feedback in the LGN. When fitted with a difference-of-Gaussian (DOG) model, changes in the center size, center amplitude, and surround amplitude parameters were most significantly related to the removal of cortical feedback. In summary, corticothalamic innervation of the visual thalamus can modify spatial summation properties in LGN relay cells, an effect most parsimoniously explained by changes in the excitatory-inhibitory balance.},

Raster plots revealed a striking difference in the response pattern of cells with and without feedback. This difference was reflected in the results from computing vector sum plots and the ratio of zero harmonic to the fundamental harmonic of the fast Fourier transform (FFT) for these responses. The variability of responses assessed by using the Fano factor was also different for the two groups, with the cells without feedback showing higher variability. We examined the covariance of these measures between pairs of simultaneously recorded cells with and without feedback, and they were much more strongly positively correlated with feedback. We constructed orientation tuning curves from the central 5 ms in the raw cross-correlograms of the outputs of pairs of LGN cells, and these curves revealed much sharper tuning with feedback. We discuss the significance of these data for cortical function and suggest that the precision in stimulus-linked firing in the LGN appears as an emergent factor from the corticothalamic interaction.},

In alert monkeys performing a visual spatial attention task, we probed thalamocortical communication by electrically stimulating neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus while simultaneously recording shock-evoked responses from monosynaptically connected neurons in primary visual cortex. We found that attention enhances neuronal communication by increasing the efficacy of presynaptic input in driving postsynaptic responses, by increasing synchronous responses among ensembles of postsynaptic neurons receiving independent input, and by decreasing redundant signals between postsynaptic neurons receiving common input. The results demonstrate that attention finely tunes neuronal communication at the synaptic level by selectively altering synaptic weights, enabling enhanced detection of salient events in the noisy sensory environment.},

Here, we compared the magnitude and latency of attentional enhancement of firing rates in V1, V2, and V4 in the same animals performing the same task. We found a reverse order of attentional effects, such that attentional enhancement was larger and earlier in V4 and smaller and later in V1, with intermediate results in V2.

abstract = {We have studied the spatiotemporal receptive-field organization of 144 neurons recorded from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of adult cats and kittens at 4 and 8 wk postnatal. Receptive-field profiles were obtained with the use of a reverse correlation technique, in which we compute the cross-correlation between the action potential train of a neuron and a randomized sequence of long bright and dark bar stimuli that are flashed throughout the receptive field. Spatiotemporal receptive-field profiles of LGN neurons generally exhibit a biphasic temporal response, as well as the classical center-surround spatial organization. For nonlagged cells, the first temporal phase of the response dominates, whereas for lagged neurons, the second temporal phase of the response is typically the largest. This temporal phase difference between lagged and nonlagged cells accounts for their divergent behavior in response to flashed stimuli. Most LGN cells exhibit some degree of space-time inseparability, which means that the receptive field cannot simply be viewed as the product of a spatial waveform and a temporal waveform. In these cases, the response of the surround is typically delayed relative to that of the center, and there is some blending of center and surround during the time course of the response. We demonstrate that a simple extension of the traditional difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) model, in which the surround response is delayed relative to that of the center, accounts nicely for these findings. With regard to development, our analysis shows that spatial and temporal aspects of receptive field structure mature with markedly different time courses. After 4 wk postnatal, there is little change in the spatial organization of LGN receptive fields, with the exception of a weak, but significant, trend for the surround to become smaller and stronger with age. In contrast, there are substantial changes in temporal receptive-field structure after 4 wk postnatal. From 4 to 8 wk postnatal, the shape of the temporal response profile changes, becoming more biphasic, but the latency and duration of the response remain unchanged. From 8 wk postnatal to adulthood, the shape of the temporal profile remains approximately constant, but there is a dramatic decline in both the latency and duration of the response. Comparison of our results with recent data from cortical (area 17) simple cells reveals that the temporal development of LGN cells accounts for a substantial portion of the temporal maturation of simple cells.},

By combining focal cortical inactivation (produced by microinjection of the GABAA agonist muscimol), with chronic multielectrode record- ings, we observed that feedback from the rat SI cortex has multiple influences on its primary thalamic relay, the ventral posterior medial (VPM) nucleus. Our data demonstrate that, when single-whisker stimuli were used, the elimination of cortical feedback caused signif- icant changes in the spatiotemporal structure of the re- ceptive fields of VPM neurons. Cortical feedback also accounted for the nonlinear summation of VPM neural responses to simultaneously stimulated whiskers, in ef- fect “linearizing” the responses. These results argue that the integration and transmission of tactile information through VPM are strongly influenced by the state of SI cortex.},

abstract = {For many neurons in the early visual brain the optimal stimulation for driving a response changes from one stimulus pattern to the opposite stimulus pattern over short periods of time. For example, many neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) respond to a bright stimulus initially but prefer a dark stimulus only 20 milliseconds later in time, and similar changes in response preference have been found for neurons in other areas. What would be the computational reason for these biphasic response dynamics? We describe a hierarchical model of predictive coding that explains these response properties. In the model, higher-level neurons attempt to predict their lower-level input, while lower-level neurons signal the difference between actual input and the higher-level predictions. In our simulations we focus on the LGN and area V1 and find that after training on natural images the layout of model connections resembles the brain’s LGN-V1 connectivity structure. In addition, the responses of model LGN neurons are biphasic in time, resembling biphasic responses as found in neurophysiology. Moreover, the model displays a specific pattern of influence of feedback from higher-level areas that was recently observed in neurophysiology. These results corroborate the idea that predictive feedback is a general coding strategy in the brain.},

This can follow from laterally directed connections in the local circuit at the level of the cell in question but could also involve more complex interactions. In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the cells relaying the retinal input display a concentric, center surround organization that in part follows from the similar organization characterizing the retinal cells providing their input. However, local thalamic inhibitory interneurons also play a role, and as we examine here, feedback from the visual cortex too. Here, we show in the primate (macaque) that spatially organized cortical feedback provides a clear and differential influence serving to enhance both responses to stimulation within the center of the receptive field and the ability of the nonclassical surround mechanism to attenuate this. In short, both center and surround mechanisms are influenced by the feedback. This dynamically sharpens the spatial focus of the receptive field and introduces nonlinearities from the cortical mechanism into the LGN.},

Neural mechanisms of figure-ground detection have been associated with feedback interactions between higher centers and primary visual cortex and have been held to index the effect of global analysis on local feature encoding. Here, in recordings from visual thalamus of alert primates, we demonstrate a robust enhancement of neuronal firing when the figure, as opposed to the ground, component of a motion-defined figure-ground stimulus is located over the receptive field. In this paradigm, visual stimulation of the receptive field and its near environs is identical across both conditions, suggesting the response enhancement reflects higher integrative mechanisms. It thus appears that cortical activity generating the higher-order percept of the figure is simultaneously reentered into the lowest level that is anatomically possible (the thalamus), so that the signature of the evolving representation of the figure is imprinted on the input driving it in an iterative process.},

In particular, we extend current formulations of the brain as an organ of inference—based upon hierarchical predictive coding—and consider how these inferences are orchestrated. In other words, what would the brain require to dynamically coordinate and contextualize its message passing to optimize its computational goals? The answer that emerges rests on the delicate (modulatory) gain control of neuronal populations that select and coordinate (prediction error) signals that ascend cortical hierarchies. This is important because it speaks to a hierarchical anatomy of extrinsic (between region) connections that form two distinct classes, namely a class of driving (first-order) connections that are concerned with encoding the content of neuronal representations and a class of modulatory (second-order) connections that establish context—in the form of the salience or precision ascribed to content. We explore the implications of this distinction from a formal perspective (using simulations of feature–ground segregation) and consider the neurobiological substrates of the ensuing precision-engineered dynamics, with a special focus on the pulvinar and attention.},

of which is central to understanding perception and cognition. The
visual thalamus consists of three main nuclei: the lateral geniculate
nucleus (LGN), the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), and the pulvinar.
The LGN is the thalamic station in the retinocortical projection and has
traditionally been viewed as the gateway to the visual cortex. The TRN
forms a thin shell of neurons surrounding the thalamus and providing an
interface between the thalamus and cortex in that thalamocortical and
(layer 6) corticothalamic projections also have collateral branches to the
TRN. The pulvinar is a large nucleus located in the dorsal thalamus. It
contains several visual maps that are reciprocally connected to striate
and extrastriate cortex, in addition to being substantially interconnected
with frontal and parietal cortex.},

Neurophysiol. 85: 235-246, 2001. The responses of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) cells in the common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) to drifting luminance or cone isolating gratings of different spatial frequencies and contrasts were measured. The response noise, defined as the variability of the responses to single sweeps in the complex plane, was independent of stimulus contrast and spatial frequency but increased with increasing overall responsiveness of the cell. The signal-to-noise ratio of parvocellular (PC) cells was smaller than of magnocellular (MC) cells. At each contrast, the response amplitude as a function of spatial frequency could be described with a difference of Gaussians model. With this model, the sizes and the peak sensitivities of the receptive field centers and surrounds were estimated. It was found that receptive field center and surround sizes of LGN cells decrease slightly with increasing contrast. Further, the peak sensitivity decreases with increasing contrast. The two factors are involved in a decrease in responsivity (the response per unit contrast) with increasing contrast which is compatible to response saturation for low spatial frequency stimuli. PC cells did not saturate as much to luminance stimuli although some saturation was found with cone isolating gratings. We found that the response phase lag of both PC and MC cells decreased with increasing contrast, which cannot be explained on the basis of linear response behavior. Apparently the phase of LGN cell responses to drifting gratings is altered in comparison with the retinal inputs by additional nonlinearities.},

This procedure was performed to quantify the contribution of descending corticofugal projections on (i) the normal organization of thalamic somatosensory receptive fields and (ii) the thalamic somatosensory plastic reorganization that immediately follows a peripheral deafferentation. Reversible inactivation of SI cortex resulted in immediate changes in receptive field properties throughout the VPM. Cortical inactivation also significantly reduced but did not completely eliminate the occurrence of VPM receptive field reorganization resulting from the reversible peripheral deafferentation.

abstract = {The major pathway for visual information reaching cerebral cortex is through the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus. Acting on this vital relay is another thalamic nucleus, the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). This nucleus receives topographically organized collaterals from both thalamus and cortex and sends similarly organized projections back to thalamus. The inputs to the TRN are excitatory, but the output back to the thalamic relay is inhibitory, providing an ideal organization for modulating visual activity during early processing. This functional architecture led Crick in 1984 to hypothesize that TRN serves to direct a searchlight of attention to different regions of the topographic map; however, despite the substantial influence of this hypothesis, the activity of TRN neurons has never been determined during an attention task. We have determined the nature of the response of visual TRN neurons in awake monkeys, and the modulation of that response as the monkeys shifted attention between visual and auditory stimuli. Visual TRN neurons had a strong (194 spikes/s) and fast (25 ms latency) transient increase of activity to spots of light falling in their receptive fields, as well as high background firing rate (45 spikes/s). When attention shifted to the spots of light, the amplitude of the transient visual response typically increased, whereas other neuronal response characteristics remained unchanged. Thus, as predicted previously, TRN activity is modified by shifts of visual attention, and these attentional changes could influence visual processing in LGN via the inhibitory connections back to the thalamus.},

Increases in the responses of visual neurons with attention have been extensively studied along the visual processing streams in monkey cerebral cortex, from primary visual areas to parietal and frontal cortex1, 2, 3, 4. Here we show, by recording neurons in attending macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta), that attention modulates visual signals before they even reach cortex by increasing responses of both magnocellular and parvocellular neurons in the first relay between retina and cortex, the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). At the same time, attention decreases neuronal responses in the adjacent thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). Crick5 argued for such modulation of the LGN by observing that it is inhibited by the TRN, and suggested that ``if the thalamus is the gateway to the cortex, the reticular complex might be described as the guardian of the gateway’’, a reciprocal relationship we now show to be more than just hypothesis. The reciprocal modulation in LGN and TRN appears only during the initial visual response, but the modulation of LGN reappears later in the response, suggesting separate early and late sources of attentional modulation in LGN.},

The thalamus contributes to a range of basic cognitive behaviors that include learning and memory, inhibitory control, decision-making, and the control of visual orienting responses. Its functions are deeply intertwined with those of the better studied cortex, although the principles governing its coordination with the cortex remain opaque, particularly in higher-level aspects of cognition. How should the thalamus be viewed in the context of the rest of the brain? Although its role extends well beyond relaying of sensory information from the periphery, the main function of many of its subdivisions does appear to be that of a relay station, transmitting neural signals primarily to the cerebral cortex from a number of brain areas. In cognition, its main contribution may thus be to coordinate signals between diverse regions of the telencephalon, including the neocortex, hippocampus, amygdala, and striatum. This central coordination is further subject to considerable extrinsic control, for example, inhibition from the basal ganglia, zona incerta, and pretectal regions, and chemical modulation from ascending neurotransmitter systems. What follows is a brief review on the role of the thalamus in aspects of cognition and behavior, focusing on a summary of the topics covered in a mini-symposium held at the Society for Neuroscience meeting, 2014.},

abstract = {Two approaches were adopted to study the pattern of connectivity between the cat visual cortex and lateral geniculate nucleus. Fourteen individual cortico-geniculate axons were labeled and reconstructed after intracellular or extracellular injection of biocytin into regions of known receptive-field position and ocular dominance preference, and the distribution of boutons from multi-axon clusters was mapped in three dimensions and compared with the locations of strategically placed geniculate recordings made in the same tissue. The results show that the feedback has an accurate retinotopic component but that individual axons are both more extensive and more selective than described previously. Area 17 feedback axons terminate primarily in layers A and A1, but the distribution of terminal boutons is strongly biased (3:1 ratio) toward the layer that matches their eye preference. Thus, those driven by the contralateral eye preferentially target layer A, and those driven by the ipsilateral eye target layer A1. Each axon also innervates the perigeniculate nucleus (PGN), but the pattern is otherwise variable, suggesting that there are different axonal classes. The terminal fields of individual axons are much larger than described previously, with a maximum spread of 500-1500 microns. Nevertheless, the projection from a given location in area 17 has a center of maximum terminal density 400-500 microns across, which is in retinotopic correspondence with the aggregate receptive field of the cortical cells of origin. The surrounding zone of relatively sparse boutons, however, must permit corticofugal cells to influence visual processing well beyond the regions over which their own responses summate. It follows that any geniculate cell receives corticofugal input covering an equally extensive area of visual space.},

By simultaneously recording one of the retinal ganglion cell (RGC) inputs (S-potentials) to an LGN cell, we find that half of this suppression at high spatial frequencies arises from the retinal input, and that suppression in LGN cells is greater than that in RGCs, regardless of spatial frequency. We also inactivated the ipsilateral visual cortex and show that one quarter of the suppression at high spatial frequencies arises from corticothalamic feedback. We show that this suppression at high spatial frequencies is co-localized with the classical surround, is not dependent on the relative orientation of the center and surround stimuli, and that the cortical component of this suppression is divisive. We propose that the role of this suppression at high spatial frequencies is to restrict the response to large stimuli composed of high spatial frequencies.},

Here we show that layer six in the primary visual cortex of the mouse has a crucial role in controlling the gain of visually evoked activity in neurons of the upper layers without changing their tuning to orientation. This gain modulation results from the coordinated action of layer six intracortical projections to superficial layers and deep projections to the thalamus, with a substantial role of the intracortical circuit. This study establishes layer six as a major mediator of cortical gain modulation and suggests that it could be a node through which convergent inputs from several brain areas can regulate the earliest steps of cortical visual processing.},

We investigated a potential role for burst in the detection of novel stimuli by recording neuronal activity in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of behaving monkeys during a visual detection task. Our results show that bursts are often the neuron’s first response, and are more numerous in the response to attended target stimuli than to unattended distractor stimuli. Bursts are indicators of the task novelty, as repetition decreased bursting. Because the primary visual cortex is the major modulatory input to the LGN, we compared the results obtained in control conditions with those observed when cortical activity was reduced by TMS. This cortical deactivation reduced visual response related bursting by 90%. These results highlight a novel role for the thalamus, able to code higher order image attributes as important as novelty early in the thalamo-cortical conversation.},

We measured neuronal activity in V1 and V4 in a task where monkeys either made an eye movement to texture-defined figures or ignored them.

The highest level of attention-related thalamic activity is seen under conditions of low arousal (secondary to sleep deprivation) compared with high arousal (secondary to caffeine administration). Other brain regions were also active during the attentional task, but these areas did not change their activity as a function of arousal. Control experiments establish that this pattern of changes in thalamic activity cannot be accounted for by nonspecific effects of arousal on cerebral hemodynamics.

Tonic firing is seen when the T channels are inactivated via membrane depolarization, and burst firing is seen when the T channels are activated from a hyperpolarized state. These response modes have very different effects on the relay of information to the cortex. It had been thought that only tonic firing is seen in the awake, alert animal, but recent evidence from several species suggests that bursting may also occur. We have begun to explore this issue in macaque monkeys by recording from thalamic relay cells of unanesthetized, behaving animals. In the lateral geniculate nucleus, the thalamic relay for retinal information, we found that tonic mode dominated responses both during alert behavior as well as during sleep. We nonetheless found burst firing present during the vigilant, waking state. There was, however, considerably more burst mode firing during sleep than wakefulness. Surprisingly, we did not find the bursting during sleep to be rhythmic. We also recorded from relay cells of the somatosensory thalamus. Interestingly, not only did these somatosensory neurons exhibit much more burst mode activity than did geniculate cells, but bursting during sleep was highly rhythmic. It thus appears that the level and nature of relay cell bursting may not be constant across all thalamic nuclei.},

Of these changes, the most prominent was a biphasic modulation of response strength, weak suppression followed by strong enhancement. Saccadic modulation was widespread, and affected both of the major processing streams in the LGN. Our results demonstrate that during natural viewing, thalamic response properties can vary dramatically, even over the course of a single fixation.},

title = {The cognitive thalamus}, 
journal = {Front Syst Neurosci}, 
volume = {9}, 
number = {}, 
pages = {39}, 
year = {2015}, 
abstract = {The thalamus, once viewed as passively relaying sensory information to the cerebral cortex, is becoming increasingly acknowledged as actively regulating the information transmitted to cortical areas. There are a number of reasons for this change. First, evidence suggests that first-order thalamic areas, like the lateral geniculate nucleus, ventral division of the medial geniculate nucleus, and the ventral posterior nuclei, can modulate neural processing along the sensory pathways to the cortex according to behavioral context (O’Connor et al., 2002; McAlonan et al., 2008). Second, much of the thalamus receives relatively little input from the sensory periphery, instead receiving its major driving input from the cortex. This higher-order thalamus forms pathways between cortical areas, which can strongly influence cortical activity (Theyel et al., 2010; Purushothaman et al., 2012; Saalmann et al., 2012). Third, lesions to higher-order thalamic areas, such as the pulvinar and mediodorsal nucleus, can produce severe attention and memory deficits (Saalmann and Kastner, 2011; Baxter, 2013; Bradfield et al., 2013; Jankowski et al., 2013; Mitchell and Chakraborty, 2013), suggesting an important role for the thalamus in cognition.

In this Research Topic, we bring together neuroscientists who study different parts of the thalamus, particularly the higher-order thalamic nuclei, to highlight thalamic contributions to learning (Bradfield et al., 2013; Habib et al., 2013), memory processes (Baxter, 2013; Funahashi, 2013; Jankowski et al., 2013; Mitchell and Chakraborty, 2013; Saalmann, 2014), set-shifting (Bradfield et al., 2013; Minamimoto et al., 2014; Saalmann, 2014), language (Klostermann et al., 2013), as well as movement monitoring and control (Ostendorf et al., 2013; Prevosto and Sommer, 2013; Minamimoto et al., 2014). These studies incorporate a range of methods, from molecular to systems-level approaches, and connect rodent, non-human primate and human data, for a better understanding of human cognition.

The first three articles focus on movement monitoring and motor control. Based on lesion data from clinical subjects, Ostendorf et al. (2013) show that the central thalamus makes an important contribution to predicting the perceptual consequences of eye movements. Focusing on cerebello-cortical pathways incorporating the central and ventral lateral thalamus, Prevosto and Sommer (2013) review evidence for thalamic modulation of movement processing based on cognitive requirements. Encompassing a number of thalamic nuclei, including the pulvinar, mediodorsal and ventral intermediate nuclei, Klostermann et al. (2013) discuss contributions of the thalamus and basal ganglia to language perception and production.

The Research Topic continues on the theme of behavioral flexibility. Minamimoto et al. (2014) show that that the macaque centromedian nucleus, in the intralaminar thalamus, plays a role in counteracting behavioral biases, which contributes to flexible behavior via interactions with the basal ganglia. Bradfield et al. (2013) review evidence from rodent studies that another intralaminar thalamic nucleus, the parafascicular thalamus, also contributes to behavioral flexibility, whereas the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus plays a key role in acquiring goal-directed behavior.

Next, the focus shifts to memory processes. Jankowski et al. (2013) review contributions of the anterior thalamus, and its interactions with the hippocampus and cortex, to memory processing and spatial navigation in rodents. This includes evidence for oscillatory activity at theta frequencies in the anterior thalamus. Habib et al. (2013) investigate memory processes in the auditory thalamus, showing differential molecular events underlying safety learning and fear conditioning.

Finally, there are four reviews highlighting different functions of the large mediodorsal thalamic nucleus and its interactions with the prefrontal cortex in primates. Mitchell and Chakraborty (2013) discuss the effects of lesions of the mediodorsal thalamus, supporting its role in memory and other cognitive processes. Baxter (2013) argues that the mediodorsal thalamus regulates plasticity within prefrontal cortex as well as the flexibility of prefrontal-dependent operations. Funahashi (2013) reviews contributions of the mediodorsal thalamus to spatial working memory, including how interaction between the thalamus and prefrontal cortex can enable sensory-to-motor transformations of maintained information. To conclude, Saalmann (2014) proposes that the mediodorsal thalamus regulates synchrony between neurons in prefrontal cortex and, consequently, their information exchange according to cognitive control demands.

This Research Topic highlights the key contributions of the thalamus to neural processing in cortico-cortical, hippocampo-cortical, cortico-striatal and cerebello-cortical pathways. Although the underlying mechanisms of thalamic influence on these pathways remain to be clarified, there is growing evidence that the thalamus plays a key role in dynamically routing information across the brain (Saalmann et al., 2012; Xu and Sudhof, 2013). Such a role may involve flexibly synchronizing ensembles of neurons, thereby configuring brain networks for the current behavioral context. Taken together, the articles in this Research Topic show that thalamic interactions with cortical and subcortical areas are integral to behavioral flexibility, memory processes and cognition in general.},

These pathways enable the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar to regulate the information transmitted to cortical areas according to cognitive requirements. Emerging evidence suggests that such regulation involves changing the degree of synchrony between neurons as well as changing the magnitude of thalamic activity. These findings support a role for the thalamus that extends as far as contributing to the control of visual attention and awareness.},

abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) receive feedforward input from the thalamus, which shapes receptive-field properties. They additionally receive recurrent inputs via horizontal connections within V1 and feedback from higher visual areas that are thought to be important for conscious visual perception. Here, we investigated what roles different glutamate receptors play in conveying feedforward and recurrent inputs in macaque V1. As a measure of recurrent processing, we used figure-ground modulation (FGM), the increased activity of neurons representing figures compared with background, which depends on feedback from higher areas. We found that feedforward-driven activity was strongly reduced by the AMPA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), whereas this drug had no effect on FGM. In contrast, blockers of the NMDA receptor reduced FGM, whereas their effect on visually driven activity varied with the subunit specificity of the drug. The NMDA receptor blocker 2-amino-5-phosphonovalerate (APV) caused a slight reduction of the visual response, whereas ifenprodil, which targets NMDA receptors containing the NMDA receptor NR2B subunit, increased the visual response. These findings demonstrate that glutamate receptors contribute differently to feedforward and recurrent processing in V1 and suggest ways to selectively disrupt recurrent processing so that its role in visual perception can be elucidated.},

Also, identifying Class 1 inputs to a thalamic nucleus tells us its main function (e.g. the lateral geniculate nucleus, or LGN, is the relay of retinal Class 1 input), and such identification leads to a division of thalamic relays into first and higher order: the former receives Class 1 inputs from subcortical sources; the latter, from layer 5 of cortex, which it then relays to another cortical area. When a cortical area directly connects with another, it often has a parallel, transthalamic connection through these higher order relays. This leads to a novel appreciation of cortical functioning and raises many new questions.},

Here, we consider the circuit formed by layer 6 feedback cells in the visual cortex and how this straddles the retinothalamic and thalamocortical transfer of visual input.

In particular, the functional significance of the topographic precision of CT feedback is unknown. We addressed these issues in the rodent somatosensory whisker/barrel system by deflecting individual whiskers and pharmacologically enhancing activity in layer VI of single whisker-related cortical columns. Enhancement of corticothalamic activity in a cortical column facilitated whisker-evoked responses in topographically aligned thalamic barreloid neurons, while activation of an adjacent column weakly suppressed activity at the same thalamic site. Both effects were more pronounced when stimulating the preferred, or principal, whisker than for adjacent whiskers. Thus, facilitation by homologous CT feedback sharpens thalamic receptive field focus, while suppression by nonhomologous feedback diminishes it. Our findings demonstrate that somatosensory cortex can selectively regulate thalamic spatial response tuning by engaging topographically specific excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms in the thalamus.},

abstract = {1. In the cat visual cortex (VC), electrophoretic glutamate application at a depth corresponding to layer VI may have excitatory or inhibitory effects on relay cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Corticofugal excitation was seen, if the receptive field centers (RFCs) of the VC neurons recorded at the application site were within 2.3 degrees of the RFCs of the LGN neurons under test. Inhibitory effects were seen if the RFCs of both cells were further apart up to 3.1 degrees. Glutamate application at more superficial cortical sites had no effect on LGN-neuron activity. 2. Cross-correlation analysis between spontaneous activities of simultaneously recorded VC and LGN neurons revealed excitatory cortico-geniculate connections in 18 pairs with RFCs separated by less than 1.7 degrees. In 15 pairs the peak latency of the excitation was 2--5 msec (3.4 msec in the average), 3 pairs showed long cortico-geniculate latencies (13--18 msec). The existence of a fast and slow cortico-geniculate system is suggested. 3. Inhibitory cortico-geniculate interaction was demonstrated with cross-correlation analysis in 8 pairs of which 4 had RFCs separated by more than 1.7 degrees. The onset latency of the inhibition was 2--7 msec except for 2 pairs with about 20 msec latency. 4. Most of the LGN neurons which were affected by cortical glutamate application or which showed an excitatory or inhibitory connection with a VC neurons were sustained cells, while the majority of VC neurons which were recorded in the effective glutamate application sites or which showed a significant interaction with LGN neurons in the cross-correlogram were binocularly driven and complex, with mostly large RFCs (mean diameter 3.5 degrees). They responded briskly to moving small spots as well as to moving slits. 5. It is concluded that the corticofugal excitatory effect is transmitted through monosynaptic links from VC neurons located in layer VI (complex cell) to LGN relay neurons (mostly sustained-cell) and this system is organized in a precise topographical manner. 6. In an Appendix neuron pairs which showed a positive correlation in the geniculo-cortical direction were described. The findings may support the view that complex as well as simple cells are drive monosynaptically from geniculo-cortical afferents of the sustained or transient type.},

Here we present evidence showing that the orientation and the on- and off-zones of receptive fields of layer 6 simple cells in cat visual cortex that provide feedback to the thalamus are similarly linked to the alignment and properties of the receptive fields of the thalamic cells they contact.

abstract = {Principles of efficient coding suggest that the peripheral units of any sensory processing system are designed for efficient coding. The function of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) as an early stage in the visual system is not well understood. Some findings indicate that similar to the retina that decorrelates input signals spatially, the LGN tends to perform a temporal decorrelation. There is evidence suggesting that corticogeniculate connections may account for this decorrelation in the LGN. In this study, we propose a computational model based on biological evidence reported by Wang et al. (2006), who demonstrated that the influence pattern of V1 feedback is phase-reversed. The output of our model shows how corticogeniculate connections decorrelate LGN responses and make an efficient representation. We evaluated our model using criteria that have previously been tested on LGN neurons through cell recording experiments, including sparseness, entropy, power spectra, and information transfer. We also considered the role of the LGN in higher-order visual object processing, comparing the categorization performance of human subjects with a cortical object recognition model in the presence and absence of our LGN input-stage model. Our results show that the new model that considers the role of the LGN, more closely follows the categorization performance of human subjects.},

abstract = {Binocular disparity is an important cue for depth perception. To correctly represent disparity, neurons must find corresponding visual features between the left- and right-eye images. The visual pathway ascending from V1 to inferior temporal cortex solves the correspondence problem. An intermediate area, V4, has been proposed to be a critical stage in the correspondence process. However, the distinction between V1 and V4 is unclear, as accumulating evidence suggests that the process begins within V1. Here, we report that the pooled responses in macaque V4, but not responses of individual neurons, represent a solution to the correspondence problem. We recorded single-unit responses of V4 neurons to random-dot stereograms of varying degrees of anticorrelation. To achieve gradual anticorrelation, we reversed the contrast of an increasing proportion of dots as in our previous psychophysical studies, which predicted that the neural correlates of the solution to correspondence problem should gradually eliminate their disparity modulation as the level of anticorrelation increases. Inconsistent with this prediction, the tuning amplitudes of individual V4 neurons quickly decreased to a nonzero baseline with small anticorrelation. By contrast, the shapes of individual tuning curves changed more gradually, so that the amplitude of population-pooled responses gradually decreased toward zero over the entire range of graded anticorrelation. We explain these results by combining multiple energy-model subunits. From a comparison with the population-pooled responses in V1, we suggest that disparity representation in V4 is distinctly advanced from that in V1. Population readout of V4 responses provides disparity information consistent with the correspondence solution.},

With this method, we observed a rapid initial recovery in the LPZ and, during the following weeks, 63-89% of the sites in the LPZ showed recovery of visual responses with significant position tuning. The RFs shifted ∼3° away from the scotoma. In the absence of a lesion, visual stimulation surrounding an artificial scotoma did not elicit visual responses, suggesting that the postlesion RF shifts resulted from cortical reorganization. Interestingly, although both spikes and LFPs gave consistent prelesion position tuning, only spikes reflected the postlesion remapping.},

We present here an algorithm that rapidly finds all single or multineuron patterns that repeat two or more times within a block of data, as well as equations for calculating the number of patterns of given length and repetition that would be expected. The complexity of patterns for which it is practical to compute expected numbers is three to six spikes (inclusive). 3. Confidence limits are based on these expected numbers of patterns, so that is possible to identify groups of patterns that are worthy of further analysis. 4. These methods are tested against simulated multineuron data that has various types of known nonstationarities, with good agreement between observed and expected values. 5. Application to real spike trains shows a large excess of observed repeating patterns, of which some, but not all, are shown to be due to bursts of high frequency firing. 6. It should be possible to apply the new method as a filter in real time in order to search for an association between repeated pattern events and externally observable events (stimulus, behavior, etc.).

abstract = {The study presents a thalamocortical network model which oscillates within the alpha frequency band (8-13 Hz) as recorded in the wakeful relaxed state with closed eyes to study the neural causes of abnormal oscillatory activity in Alzheimer’s disease (AD). Incorporated within the model are various types of cortical excitatory and inhibitory neurons, recurrently connected to thalamic and reticular thalamic regions with the ratios and distances derived from the mammalian thalamocortical system. The model is utilized to study the impacts of four types of connectivity loss on the model’s spectral dynamics. The study focuses on investigating degeneration of corticocortical, thalamocortical, corticothalamic, and corticoreticular couplings, with an emphasis on the influence of each modeled case on the spectral output of the model. Synaptic compensation has been included in each model to examine the interplay between synaptic deletion and compensation mechanisms, and the oscillatory activity of the network. The results of power spectra and event related desynchronization/synchronization (ERD/S) analyses show that the dynamics of the thalamic and cortical oscillations are significantly influenced by corticocortical synaptic loss. Interestingly, the patterns of changes in thalamic spectral activity are correlated with those in the cortical model. Similarly, the thalamic oscillatory activity is diminished after partial corticothalamic denervation. The results suggest that thalamic atrophy is a secondary pathology to cortical shrinkage in Alzheimer’s disease. In addition, this study finds that the inhibition from neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (RTN) to thalamic relay (TCR) neurons plays a key role in regulating thalamic oscillations; disinhibition disrupts thalamic oscillatory activity even though TCR neurons are more depolarized after being released from RTN inhibition. This study provides information that can be explored experimentally to further our understanding on the neurodegeneration associated with AD pathology.},

Previous studies indicate that dLGN interneurons inhibit TC neurons by releasing GABA from both axons and dendrites. However, the mechanisms controlling GABA release are poorly understood. Here, using simultaneous whole-cell recordings from interneurons and TC neurons and two-photon calcium imaging, we find that synchronous activation of multiple retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) triggers sodium spikes that propagate throughout interneuron axons and dendrites, and calcium spikes that invade dendrites but not axons. These distinct modes of interneuron firing can trigger both a rapid and a sustained component of inhibition onto TC neurons. Our studies suggest that active conductances make LGN interneurons flexible circuit-elements that can shift their spatial and temporal properties of GABA release in response to coincident activation of functionally related subsets of RGCs.},

abstract = {Background noise and spike overlap pose problems in contemporary spike-sorting strategies. We attempted to resolve both issues by introducing a hybrid scheme that combines the robust representation of spike waveforms to facilitate the reliable identification of contributing neurons with efficient data learning to enable the precise decomposition of coactivations. The isometric feature mapping (ISOMAP) technique reveals the intrinsic data structure, helps with recognising the involved neurons and, simultaneously, identifies the overlaps. Exemplar activation patterns are first estimated for all detected neurons and consecutively used to build a synthetic database in which spike overlaps are systematically varied and realistic noise is added. An Extreme Learning Machine (ELM) is then trained with the ISOMAP representation of this database and learns to associate the synthesised waveforms with the corresponding source neurons. The trained ELM is finally applied to the actual overlaps from the experimental data and this completes the entire spike-sorting process. Our approach is better characterised as semi-supervised, noise-assisted strategy of an empirical nature. The user’s engagement is restricted at recognising the number of active neurons from low-dimensional point-diagrams and at deciding about the complexity of overlaps. Efficiency is inherited from the incorporation of well-established algorithms. Moreover, robustness is guaranteed by adaptation to the actual noise properties of a given data set. The validity of our work has been verified via extensive experimentation, using realistically simulated data, under different levels of noise.},

This model is based upon active inference, in which subjects try to minimise their (proprioceptive) prediction error based upon posterior beliefs about the hidden causes of their (exteroceptive) sensory input. Our model appeals to a single principle--the minimisation of variational free energy--to provide Bayes optimal solutions to the smooth pursuit problem. However, it tries to accommodate the cardinal features of smooth pursuit of partially occluded targets that have been observed empirically in normal subjects and schizophrenia. Specifically, we account for the ability of normal subjects to anticipate periodic target trajectories and emit pre-emptive smooth pursuit eye movements--prior to the emergence of a target from behind an occluder. Furthermore, we show that a single deficit in the postsynaptic gain of prediction error units (encoding the precision of posterior beliefs) can account for several features of smooth pursuit in schizophrenia: namely, a reduction in motor gain and anticipatory eye movements during visual occlusion, a paradoxical improvement in tracking unpredicted deviations from target trajectories and a failure to recognise and exploit regularities in the periodic motion of visual targets. This model will form the basis of subsequent (dynamic causal) models of empirical eye tracking measurements, which we hope to validate, using psychopharmacology and studies of schizophrenia.},

Most laboratories use polymethyl methacrylate to attach a recording chamber over the skull opening. Here, we describe a titanium chamber that fastens to the skull with screws, using no polymethyl methacrylate. The gap between the base of the chamber and the skull is filled with hydroxyapatite, forming a watertight gasket. As the chamber base osseointegates with the skull, the hydroxyapatite is replaced with bone. Rather than having a finite lifetime, the recording chamber becomes more firmly anchored the longer it is in place. It has a small footprint, low profile, and needs little maintenance to control infection. Toilette consists of occasional application of betadine to clean the scalp margin, followed by application of neomycin, polymyxin, and bacitracin ointment. Antibiotic is also placed inside the chamber to suppress bacterial proliferation. Thickening of the dura within the chamber can be prevented by regular application of mitocycin C and/or bevacizumab, an antibody against vascular endothelial growth factor. By conducting an e-mail survey, this protocol for chamber maintenance was compared with procedures used in 37 other vision research laboratories. Refinement of appliances and techniques used for recordings in awake monkeys promises to increase the pace of scientific discovery and to benefit animal welfare.},

year = {1999}, 
abstract = {In their report, Lee and Blake (1) asked whether the visual system could use temporal microstructure to bind image regions into unified objects, as has been proposed in some neural models (2). Lee and Blake presented two regions of dynamic texture. The elements of the target region changed in synchrony according to a random sequence, while the elements of the background region changed at independent times. The stimulus was designed in an attempt to remove all classical form-giving cues such as luminance, contrast, or motion, so that timing itself would provide the only cue. Subjects were readily able to distinguish the shape of the target region. Lee and Blake posited the existence of new visual mechanisms “exquisitely sensitive to the rich temporal structure contained in these high-order stochastic events.” The results have generated much excitement (3).
However, we believe that the effects can be explained with well-known mechanisms. The filtering properties of early vision can convert the task into a simple static or dynamic texture discrimination problem. A sustained cell (temporal lowpass) will emphasize static texture through the mechanisms of visual persistence; a transient cell (temporal bandpass) will emphasize texture that is flickering or moving.
We simulated a lowpass mechanism to see what would emerge. Lee and Blake’s stimuli were composed of randomly oriented Gabor elements, where the Gabor phase shifted forward or backward on each frame according to a coin-flip. We downloaded one such movie from their Web site and ran it through a temporal lowpass filter (4) (An input frame is shown in Fig. 1A; a filtered output frame is shown in Fig. 1B.). At the particular moment shown, the target region has a lower effective contrast than does the background, providing a strong form cue. At other moments the target’s contrast may be above or below the background’s contrast because of statistical fluctuations in the reversal sequences. If a single Gabor element happens to have a run of multiple shifts in one direction, its effective contrast is low because of the temporal averaging. Conversely, if it has a run of alternating forward and backward shifts, thus “jittering” in place, its contrast remains fairly high. Within the unsynchronized background the local contrasts fluctuate randomly, but within the synchronized target region they all rise and fall in unison, revealing a distinct rectangular form.

Figure 1
: (A) One input frame; (B) result of temporal integration with synchronized target and unsynchronized background; (C and D) results of temporal integration when the target and background are each synchronized.

In a second experiment Lee and Blake synchronized both the target and background region, each to its own random sequence. Here the target was even more clearly visible. This result is predicted by our hypothesis. Since both background and target are synchronized, they will both yield uniform texture contrasts after temporal filtering. There will be moments when, by chance, one region’s contrast is high while the other’s is low, and the target will become especially clear. Figure 1C shows one such moment, again the result of filtering a movie from the Web site with the lowpass filter. Figure 1D shows a moment when the relative contrasts are reversed. We also ran movies through a temporal bandpass filter (5) with a biphasic impulse response, to simulate a transient mechanism. Again, the target was clearly revealed.
Our hypothesis also predicts, with the use of either filter, Lee and Blake’s finding that discrimination will be best when the reversal sequences have high entropy, that is, when the coin-flip is unbiased. The contrast cue is best when the target “jitters” in place while the background has a run in a single direction (or vice versa). This condition happens most frequently at high entropy.
Lee and Blake’s stimuli are designed to remove form cues from single frames and from frame pairs. However, when one considers the full sequence, strong contrast cues can emerge due to the spatio-temporal filtering present in early vision. These cues probably suffice to explain the perception of form in the experiments. We do not see the need to posit mechanisms other than those already known to exist.},

In certain cases, however, two gratings do not combine into a single coherent percept, but appear to slide across one another. We have studied the conditions under which coherence does and does not occur, and we report here that it depends on the relative contrasts, spatial frequencies and directions of motion of the gratings.

abstract = {The response of cortical neurons to a sensory stimulus is modulated by the context. In the visual cortex, for example, stimulation of a pyramidal cell’s receptive-field surround can attenuate the cell’s response to a stimulus in the centre of its receptive field, a phenomenon called surround suppression. Whether cortical circuits contribute to surround suppression or whether the phenomenon is entirely relayed from earlier stages of visual processing is debated. Here we show that, in contrast to pyramidal cells, the response of somatostatin-expressing inhibitory neurons (SOMs) in the superficial layers of the mouse visual cortex increases with stimulation of the receptive-field surround. This difference results from the preferential excitation of SOMs by horizontal cortical axons. By perturbing the activity of SOMs, we show that these neurons contribute to pyramidal cells’ surround suppression. These results establish a cortical circuit for surround suppression and attribute a particular function to a genetically defined type of inhibitory neuron.},

abstract = {DURING the past two years the impulses occurring in various types of peripheral sense organ have been investigated by recording their action currents with the capillary electrometer and an amplifying 8ystem(1). It has been found that there is a close agreement in the behaviour of the different kinds of end organ and in the impulse discharges set up by them. The present work breaks new ground in that it deals with a special sense organ and records the impulses in fibres which differ to some extent from those of a peripheral nerve trunk. The work is far from complete, but it has already shown that the activity of the optic nerve is in close agreement with that of other sensory nerves. On the other hand, the action of the receptor apparatus of the eye is naturally far more complex than that of the peripheral sense organs. With the exception of some of Fr6hlich’s observations on the cephalopod eye(2) we have been unable to find any references to work on the action currents of the optic nerve produced either by exposure of the eye to light or by direct stimulation of the nerve. The retinal currents have been investigated repeatedly with increasing accuracy of technique since their discovery by Holmgren, and are a valuable index of the activity of the retina, but they are due to processes taking place in the eye rather than the optic nerve and they do not tell us how the results of the retinal activity are transmitted to the brain. The present work falls into three main sections. The first deals with the discharge of impulses in the optic nerve, the second deals with the relation of the optic nerve discharge to the retinal current, and the third with some points which concern the excitation of the retinal structures by light. An appendix by one of us (R. K. M.) gives some data on the histology of the eel’s optic nerve.},

In the present paper we are concerned more particularly with the initial stages of the process, i.e. with the excitation of the retinal elements, and we shall have little to say about the subsequent nervous changes. The latter have shown themselves to be of great interest from the neurological point of view, but before we dealt with them at length it seemed worth while to try and gain a little more information about the action of light as a stimulus to the retina. We have attempted to do this by studying the effect of flashes of light of short duration. In Part I we were mainly concerned with relatively long exposures and it was possible that some of the phenomena we found might be considerably modified with flashes. In any case a study of the response to flashes ought to give us data bearing on retinal excitation and it ought, in particular, to show how far we can liken the mechanism of the vertebrate eye to that of the much simpler organs investigated with the same method by Hecht(2).},

This arrangement can hardly fail to affect the nature of the optic nerve discharge and a knowledge of how it is affected, besides telling us something about the eye, might also give results of more general interest concerning the action of the synaptic junction. In previous papers(l) on the action currents in the eel’s optic nerve we have called attention to two features of the nerve discharge which might depend on synaptic conduction, namely, the long and variable reaction time and its dependence on the area illuminated as well as on the intensity of the light. In discussing these points we suggested a temporal and spatial summation in the nervous paths as a possible explanation, but we could not exclude the alternative possibility that they were due to the preliminary changes caused by the light before any nervous excitation had taken place. Meanwhile a chance observation had given us evidence of synaptic activity of an entirely different kind and the investigation of this has now led to the conclusion that the reaction time is also dependent upon synaptic activity.},

Although it is hypothesized that perceptual discrimination between faces depends on the neural activity of IT subregions enriched with “face neurons,” such a causal link has not been directly established. Here, using optogenetic and pharmacological methods, we reversibly suppressed the neural activity in small subregions of IT cortex of macaque monkeys performing a facial gender-discrimination task. Each type of intervention independently demonstrated that suppression of IT subregions enriched in face neurons induced a contralateral deficit in face gender-discrimination behavior. The same neural suppression of other IT subregions produced no detectable change in behavior. These results establish a causal link between the neural activity in IT face neuron subregions and face gender-discrimination behavior. Also, the demonstration that brief neural suppression of specific spatial subregions of IT induces behavioral effects opens the door for applying the technical advantages of optogenetics to a systematic attack on the causal relationship between IT cortex and high-level visual perception.},

journal = {Neural Syst Circuits}, 
volume = {2}, 
number = {1}, 
pages = {5}, 
year = {2012}, 
abstract = {BACKGROUND: Precise spike synchrony, at the millisecond or even sub-millisecond time scale, has been reported in different brain areas, but its neurobiological meaning and its underlying mechanisms remain unknown or controversial. Studying these questions is complicated by the lack of a validated, well-normalized and robust index for quantifying synchrony. Previously used measures of synchrony are often improperly normalized and thereby are not comparable between different experimental conditions, are sensitive to variations in firing rate or to the firing rate differential between the two neurons, and/or rely on untenable assumptions of firing rate stationarity and Poisson statistics. I describe here a novel measure, the Jitter-Based Synchrony Index (JBSI), that overcomes these issues. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: The JBSI method is based on the introduction of virtual spike jitter. While previous implementations of the jitter method used it only to detect synchrony, the JBSI method also quantifies synchrony. Previous implementations of the jitter method used computationally intensive Monte Carlo simulations to generate surrogate spike trains, whereas the JBSI is computed analytically. The JBSI method does not assume any specific firing model, and does not require that the spike trains be locked to a repeating external stimulus. The JBSI can assume values from 1 (maximal possible synchrony) to -1 (minimal possible synchrony) and is therefore properly normalized. Using simulated Poisson spike trains with introduced controlled spike coincidences, I demonstrate that the JBSI is a linear measure of the spike coincidence rate, is independent of the mean firing frequency or the firing frequency differential between the two neurons, and is not sensitive to co-modulations in the firing rates of the two neurons. In contrast, several commonly used synchrony indices fail under one or more of these scenarios. I also demonstrate how the JBSI can be used to estimate the spike timing precision in the system. CONCLUSIONS: The JBSI is a conceptually simple and computationally efficient method that can be used to compute the statistical significance of firing synchrony, to quantify synchrony as a well-normalized index, and to estimate the degree of temporal precision in the system.},

pages = {89}, 
year = {2012}, 
abstract = {During natural viewing, the eyes are never still. Even during fixation, miniature movements of the eyes move the retinal image across tens of foveal photoreceptors. Most theories of vision implicitly assume that the visual system ignores these movements and somehow overcomes the resulting smearing. However, evidence has accumulated to indicate that fixational eye movements cannot be ignored by the visual system if fine spatial details are to be resolved. We argue that the only way the visual system can achieve its high resolution given its fixational movements is by seeing via these movements. Seeing via eye movements also eliminates the instability of the image, which would be induced by them otherwise. Here we present a hypothesis for vision, in which coarse details are spatially encoded in gaze-related coordinates, and fine spatial details are temporally encoded in relative retinal coordinates. The temporal encoding presented here achieves its highest resolution by encoding along the elongated axes of simple-cell receptive fields and not across these axes as suggested by spatial models of vision. According to our hypothesis, fine details of shape are encoded by inter-receptor temporal phases, texture by instantaneous intra-burst rates of individual receptors, and motion by inter-burst temporal frequencies. We further describe the ability of the visual system to readout the encoded information and recode it internally. We show how reading out of retinal signals can be facilitated by neuronal phase-locked loops (NPLLs), which lock to the retinal jitter; this locking enables recoding of motion information and temporal framing of shape and texture processing. A possible implementation of this locking-and-recoding process by specific thalamocortical loops is suggested. Overall it is suggested that high-acuity vision is based primarily on temporal mechanisms of the sort presented here and low-acuity vision is based primarily on spatial mechanisms.},

Here, we analyze the pattern of intrinsic connectivity within cortical area V5/MT in both parasagittal sections of the intact brain and tangential sections from flatmounted cortex using small injections of the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit b. Labeled cells were predominantly found in cortical layers 2, 3, and 6. Going along the cortical layers, labeled cells were concentrated in regularly spaced clusters. The clusters nearest to the injection site were approximately 2 mm from its center. In flatmounted cortex, along the dorsoventral axis of V5/MT, we identified further clusters of labeled cells up to 10 mm from the injection site. Quantitative analysis of parasagittal sections estimated average cluster spacing at 2.2 mm; in cortical flatmounts, spacing was 2.3 mm measured radially from the injection site. The results suggest a regular pattern of intrinsic connectivity within V5/MT, which is consistent with connectivity between sites with a common preference for both direction of motion and binocular depth. The long-range connections can potentially account for the large suppressive surrounds of V5/MT neurons.},

abstract = {Our hypothesis was that spiny stellate neurons in layer 4 of cat visual cortex receive polyneuronal innervation. We characterised the synapses of four likely sources of innervation by three simple criteria: the type of synapse, the target (spine, dendritic shaft), and the area of the presynaptic bouton. The layer 6 pyramids had the smallest boutons and formed asymmetric synapses mainly with the dendritic shaft. The thalamic afferents had the largest boutons and formed asymmetric synapses mainly with spines. The spiny stellates had medium-sized boutons and formed asymmetric synapses mainly with spines. We used these to make a “template” to match against the boutons forming synapses with the spiny stellate dendrite. Of the asymmetric synapses, 45% could have come from layer 6 pyramidal neurons, 28% from spiny stellate neurons, and 6% from thalamic afferents. The remaining 21% of asymmetric synapses could not be accounted for without assuming some additional selectivity of the presynaptic axons. Additional asymmetric synapses may come from a variety of sources, including other cortical neurons and subcortical nuclei such as the claustrum. Of the symmetric synapses, 84% could have been provided by clutch cells, which form large boutons. The remainder, formed by small boutons, probably come from other smooth neurons in layer 4, e.g., neurogliaform and bitufted neurons. Our analysis supports the hypothesis that the spiny stellate receives polyneuronal innervation, perhaps from all the sources of boutons in layer 4. Although layer 4 is the major recipient of thalamic afferents, our results show that they form only a few percent of the synapses of layer 4 spiny stellate neurons.},

abstract = {A notable feature of the connections linking V1 and MT is that MT provides feedback to V1 and that this feedback has striking effects on the responses of V1 neurons to flashing and moving stimuli (Shipp and Zeki 1989, Hupe et al. 2001, Sillito et al 2006). The receptive fields of MT cells are some ten times larger than V1 cell receptive fields and they provide a feedback projection to a retinotopic area of V1 that corresponds to this (Born and Bradley 2005). The feedback to V1 includes a projection to layer 6 where it has access to layer 6 cortico-geniculate feedback cells and could, via this route, influence a similar retinotopic area of the LGN. In temporal terms the feedback from MT has the capacity to influence the early part of the responses of cells in both V1 and the LGN. We have shown that focal inactivation of a direction column in MT using iontophoretically applied GABA modifies the responses of LGN cells to the direction context of an overlying and adjacent patch of drifting grating. These are large stimuli that equate with the scale of MT receptive fields and not those of LGN cells. They suggest the potential for predictive feedback to the LGN from MT engaged by motion context in the visual world. In this work we assumed that these effects from MT were mediated via layer 6 of V1. Can these effects be linked to layer 6?
Here we have examined whether focal iontophoretic blockade of layer 6 of V1 with GABA changes the way responses of LGN cells are influenced by motion context in large overlapping and adjacent MT field sized patches of drifting grating. We located the iontophoretic electrode used to apply GABA in layer 6 at a retinotopic location overlying that of a group of simultaneously recorded LGN cells. Blockade of layer 6 changed the responses of LGN cells to a large overlying patch of drifting grating and also the way motion context induced by an adjacent patch of drifting grating influenced this. These effects occur over a spatial scale that matches that seen for the effects driven from MT. This suggests, as the anatomy would indicate, that MT mediates its influence on LGN cell responses via layer 6 of V1.},

abstract = {The action potential discharge response of single neurons to both visual stimulation and injections of current were obtained during intracellular recordings in cat visual cortex in order to estimate the net excitatory current arriving at the soma during visual stimulation. Of 45 neurons recorded intracellularly, 19 pyramidal neurons and one basket cell were labelled with horseradish peroxidase. The discharge of all neurons adapted to constant current. For 40 neurons, a single exponential provided a good fit to the adapting discharge (r2 = 0.73 +/- 0.03) for all current intensities. Superficial layer neurons were significantly faster adapting [P < 0.001, mean (+/- SEM) time constant of adaptation = 11.5 +/- 1.3 ms; n = 20] than deep layer neurons (mean time constant of adaptation = 51.4 +/- 6.4 ms; n = 10). The percentage adaptation of the spike frequency, %(peak - adapted rate)/peak, was determined from the fitted exponential. Superficial layer neurons adapted significantly more strongly (P < 0.01, mean = 67 +/- 3%) than deep layer neurons (mean = 51 +/- 5%). The mean firing frequency in response to a current step of 320 ms duration had a linear relationship to the amplitude of the injected current (slope 66 spikes/s/nA; origin zero, mean r2 = 0.94; n = 33). This relationship provided a means of estimating the net peak excitatory current generated by visual stimuli. The estimated mean peak somatic current during the passage of a bar across the receptive field was 1.1 nA and the average current for the duration of the visually evoked discharge was 0.64 nA (n = 17). The transfer response of real and model neurons was obtained by differentiating the discharge response to a step input current and was then used to predict the output of the neuron following an arbitrary input. When these transfer responses were convolved with known input signals in model neurons, the predicted output was close to the simulated response of the model neuron to the same input waveforms. The transfer response was calculated for eight real neurons. Estimates of the net excitatory current arriving at the soma during visual stimulation was obtained by deconvolution. The mean peak somatic current for these neurons was 0.62 nA Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

abstract = {Effects of sinusoidal grating stimulus presented outside the classical receptive field (CRF) on neuronal responses were studied in the primary visual cortex of anaesthetized cats. Among 101 cells electrophysiologically recorded, the predominant effect of the stimulus in the receptive field surround (SRF) was the suppression of responses to the CRF stimulation, and the SRF grating suppressed them up to 56% of the responses (44% suppression) to the CRF stimulus alone. The strong suppression was observed more often in layer II/III cells than in other layers and in complex cells more often than in simple cells. The modulatory effects by SRF stimulus might be enhanced by the cortical recurrent excitation particularly in the superficial layers. We also examined whether the modulation by the surround grating exhibits a differential effect according to the presence or absence of figure-ground segregation in the stimulus configuration. For this purpose, effects of stimulus configuration with orientation-, direction-contrast or relative spatial phase difference between CRF and SRF stimuli (figure-ground segregated configuration) were compared with those of uniform configuration of stimulus (non-segregated configuration). There was a population of cells, which exhibited significantly stronger suppression with non-segregated configuration than with figure-ground segregated configuration. Such differential modulation of response by the SRF stimulus in the primary visual cortex is a possible basis of perceptual figure-ground segregation.},

Previous evidence suggests that top-down attention operates by modulating stimulus-evoked neural activity within visual areas specialized for processing goal-relevant information. We show that top-down attention also has a separate influence on the background coupling between visual areas: adopting different attentional goals resulted in specific patterns of noise correlations in the visual system, whereby intrinsic activity in the same set of low-level areas was shared with only those high-level areas relevant to the current goal. These changes occurred independently of evoked activity, persisted without visual stimulation, and predicted behavioral success in deploying attention better than the modulation of evoked activity. This attentional switching of background connectivity suggests that attention may help synchronize different levels of the visual processing hierarchy, forming state-dependent functional pathways in human visual cortex to prioritize goal-relevant information.},

abstract = {When viewing a different stimulus with each eye, we experience the remarkable phenomenon of binocular rivalry: alternations in consciousness between the stimuli [1, 2]. According to a popular theory first proposed in 1901, neurons encoding the two stimuli engage in reciprocal inhibition [3-8] so that those processing one stimulus inhibit those processing the other, yielding consciousness of one dominant stimulus at any moment and suppressing the other. Also according to the theory, neurons encoding the dominant stimulus adapt, weakening their activity and the inhibition they can exert, whereas neurons encoding the suppressed stimulus recover from adaptation until the balance of activity reverses, triggering an alternation in consciousness. Despite its popularity, this theory has one glaring inconsistency with data: during an episode of suppression, visual sensitivity to brief probe stimuli in the dominant eye should decrease over time and should increase in the suppressed eye, yet sensitivity appears to be constant [9, 10]. Using more appropriate probe stimuli (experiment 1) in conjunction with a new method (experiment 2), we found that sensitivities in dominance and suppression do show the predicted complementary changes.},

Our results show that doing the auditory attention task does indeed slow visual perceptual alternations, that the slowing effect is a graded function of attentional load, and that the attentional slowing effect is less pronounced for grating rivalry than for house/face rivalry and for the Necker cube.

Orthogonally translating Gaussian-blob fields engaged in rivalry. Probes were brief monocular stimuli smoothly presented to dominant or suppressed eye with contrast varied to find threshold. 2 × 2 design: motion speed was fast (’streaky’) or slow; probe orientation was aligned or orthogonal to streaks. Subsequent experiments varied probe SF and orientation to determine any rivalry suppression tuning. Consistent with ‘streaks’, probes aligned with motion trajectory were much more deeply suppressed than orthogonal probes, but only for fast motion. Tuning data showed the strong suppression in ‘fast aligned’ conditions weakened if probe orientation and SF differed from the ‘streaks’. The high-speed orientation dependency suggests fast motions do leave neural steaks. High-speed rivalry therefore involves motion and orientation conflict, with suppression components from each dimension combining. The extra component in ‘fast aligned’ conditions was tuned, indicating feature-specific suppression.},

abstract = {We recorded from single neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) of the macaque monkey and studied their direction and orientation selectivity. We also recorded from single striate cortex (V1) neurons in order to make direct comparisons with our observations in area MT. All animals were immobilized and anesthetized with nitrous oxide. Direction selectivity of 110 MT neurons was studied with three types of moving stimuli: slits, single spots, and random-dot fields. All of the MT neurons were found to be directionally selective using one or more of these stimuli. MT neurons exhibited a broad range of direction-tuning bandwidths to all stimuli (minimum = 32 degrees, maximum = 186 degrees, mean = 95 degrees). On average, responses were strongly unidirectional and of similar magnitude for all three stimulus types. Orientation selectivity of 89 MT neurons was studied with stationary flashed slits. Eighty-three percent were found to be orientation selective. Overall, orientation-tuning bandwidths were significantly narrower (mean = 64 degrees) than direction-tuning bandwidths for moving stimuli. Moreover, responses to stationary-oriented stimuli were generally smaller than those to moving stimuli. Direction selectivity of 55 V1 neurons was studied with moving slits; orientation selectivity of 52 V1 neurons was studied with stationary flashed slits. In V1, compared with MT, direction-tuning bandwidths were narrower (mean = 68 degrees). Moreover, V1 responses to moving stimuli were weaker, and bidirectional tuning was more common. The mean orientation-tuning bandwidth in V1 was also significantly narrower than that in MT (mean = 52 degrees), but the responses to stationary-oriented stimuli were of similar magnitude in the two areas. We examined the relationship between optimal direction and optimal orientation for MT neurons and found that 61% had an orientation preference nearly perpendicular to the preferred direction of motion, as is the case for all V1 neurons. However, another 29% of MT neurons had an orientation preference roughly parallel to the preferred direction. These observations, when considered together with recent reports claiming sensitivity of some MT neurons to moving visual patterns (39), suggest specific neural mechanisms underlying pattern-motion sensitivity in area MT. These results support the notion that area MT represents a further specialization over area V1 for stimulus motion processing. Furthermore, the marked similarities between direction and orientation tuning in area MT in macaque and owl monkey support the suggestion that these areas are homologues.},

As befits its goals, human perception of visual motion largely evades this diversity of cues for image form; direction and rate of motion are perceived (with few exceptions) in a fashion that does not depend on the physical characteristics of the object. The middle temporal visual area of the primate cerebral cortex contains many neurons that respond selectively to motion in a particular direction and is an integral part of the neural substrate for perception of motion. When stimulated with moving patterns characterized by one of three very diverse cues for form, many middle temporal neurons exhibited similar directional tuning. This lack of sensitivity for figural cue characteristics may allow the uniform perception of motion of objects having a broad spectrum of physical cues.},

Building upon recent neurophysiological/behavioral studies of the cortical substrates of visual associative memory, I propose a specific functional process by which stored information about the world supplements sensory inputs to yield neuronal signals that can account for visual perceptual experience.

abstract = {The visual image formed on the retina represents an amalgam of visual scene properties, including the reflectances of surfaces, their relative positions, and the type of illumination. The challenge facing the visual system is to extract the “meaning” of the image by decomposing it into its environmental causes. For each local region of the image, that extraction of meaning is only possible if information from other regions is taken into account. Of particular importance is a set of image cues revealing surface occlusion and/or lighting conditions. These information-rich cues direct the perceptual interpretation of other more ambiguous image regions. This context-dependent transformation from image to perception has profound-but frequently under-appreciated-implications for neurophysiological studies of visual processing: To demonstrate that neuronal responses are correlated with perception of visual scene properties, rather than visual image features, neuronal sensitivity must be assessed in varied contexts that differentially influence perceptual interpretation. We review a number of recent studies that have used this context-based approach to explore the neuronal bases of visual scene perception.},

abstract = {The thalamus relays sensory information to cortex, but this information may be influenced by excitatory feedback from cortical layer VI. The full importance of this feedback has only recently been explored, but among its possible functions are influences on the processing of sensory features, synchronization of thalamic firing, and transitions in response mode of thalamic relay cells. Uncontrolled, corticothalamic feedback has also been implicated in pathological thalamic rhythms associated with certain neurological disorders. We have found a form of presynaptic inhibition of corticothalamic synaptic transmission that is mediated by a Group II metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) and activated by high-frequency corticothalamic activity. We tested putative retinogeniculate and corticogeniculate synapses for Group II mGluR modulation within the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the ferret thalamus. Stimulation of optic-tract fibers elicited paired-pulse depression of excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs), whereas stimulation of the optic radiations elicited paired-pulse facilitation. Paired-pulse responses were subsequently used to characterize the pathway of origin of stimulated synapses. Group II mGluR agonists (LY379268 and DCG-IV) applied to thalamic neurons under voltage-clamp conditions reduced the amplitude of corticogeniculate EPSCs. Stimulation with high-frequency trains produced a facilitating response that was reduced by Group II mGluR agonists, but was enhanced by the selective antagonist LY341495, revealing a presynaptic, mGluR-mediated reduction of high-frequency corticogeniculate feedback. Agonist treatment did not affect EPSCs from stimulation of the optic tract. NAAG (reported to be selective for mGluR3) was ineffective at the corticogeniculate synapse, implicating mGluR2 in the observed effects. Our data are the first to show a synaptically elicited form of presynaptic inhibition of corticothalamic synaptic transmission that is mediated by presynaptic action of mGluR2. This presynaptic inhibition may partially mute sensory feedback and prevent reentrant excitation from initiating abnormal thalamic rhythms.},

abstract = {The brain somehow merges visual information with the behavioral context in which it is being processed, a task that is often attributed to the cerebral cortex. We have identified a new role of the gaseous neurotransmitter, nitric oxide (NO), in the early selective enhancement of corticogeniculate communication that may participate in this process at the level of the thalamus. Visual information is dynamically gated through the thalamus by brainstem neurons that release acetylcholine and NO. Using in vitro electrophysiology, we characterized NO effects on excitatory postsynaptic potentials and currents (EPSCs) elicited from retinal and cortical pathways in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the ferret. NO selectively and reversibly increased cortically-evoked postsynaptic responses, and this effect was mimicked by cyclic guanosine 3’,5’-monophosphate (cGMP). Conversely, NO inhibited retinally-evoked responses independently of cGMP. We demonstrated that these differential effects were specific to postsynaptic N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptors by studying treatment effects on pharmacologically isolated EPSCs from each pathway. We propose that when brainstem activity is increased during behavioral arousal or rapid eye movement sleep, NO may increase the relative sensitivity of relay neurons to corticogeniculate feedback. The net effect of these changes in synaptic processing may be to selectively suppress peripheral information while unifying data carried by reentrant corticogeniculate loops with the behavioral context in which the visual information is processed.},

We studied excitatory postsynaptic currents elicited from corticothalamic stimulation in the visual sector of the thalamic reticular nucleus and the lateral geniculate nucleus to compare the response of these neurons to stimulation of their common input pathway. Using whole cell patch clamp recordings in ferret thalamic slices, we compared single excitatory postsynaptic current decay kinetics, presynaptic glutamate release dynamics through paired pulse facilitation and responses to corticothalamic train stimulation. We found that single thalamic reticular nucleus excitatory postsynaptic currents were significantly sharper than lateral geniculate nucleus responses. The mean thalamic reticular nucleus excitatory postsynaptic current decay constant (tau) was 4.9+/-0.5 ms, while the mean lateral geniculate nucleus excitatory postsynaptic current tau value was 11.8+/-0.8 ms. Presynaptic release dynamics as measured by responses to paired stimuli were conserved between the thalamic reticular nucleus and lateral geniculate nucleus. However, facilitating responses to train stimulation were markedly different between nuclei. Lateral geniculate nucleus responses showed proportionately larger facilitation (reaching 842.9 +/- 76.4% of excitatory postsynaptic current 1 amplitude) than thalamic reticular nucleus responses (reaching 223.1 +/- 44.0% of excitatory postsynaptic current 1 amplitude). These data indicate that while the corticothalamic pathway produces excitatory postsynaptic currents in both the thalamic reticular nucleus and lateral geniculate nucleus, other factors uniquely affect the functional integration of the inputs in each nucleus.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex are highly sensitive to the contrast, orientation, and temporal frequency of a visual stimulus. These three stimulus properties can be varied independently of one another, raising the question of how they interact to influence neuronal responses. We recorded from individual neurons in ferret primary visual cortex to determine the influence of stimulus contrast on orientation tuning, temporal-frequency tuning, and latency to visual response. Results show that orientation-tuning bandwidth is not affected by contrast level. Thus neurons in ferret visual cortex display contrast-invariant orientation tuning. Stimulus contrast does, however, influence the structure of orientation-tuning curves as measures of circular variance vary inversely with contrast for both simple and complex cells. This change in circular variance depends, in part, on a contrast-dependent change in the ratio of null to preferred orientation responses. Stimulus contrast also has an influence on the temporal-frequency tuning of cortical neurons. Both simple and complex cells display a contrast-dependent rightward shift in their temporal frequency-tuning curves that results in an increase in the highest temporal frequency needed to produce a half-maximum response (TF(50)). Results show that the degree of the contrast-dependent increase in TF(50) is similar for cortical neurons and neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and indicate that subcortical mechanisms likely play a major role in establishing the degree of effect displayed by downstream neurons. Finally, results show that LGN and cortical neurons experience a contrast-dependent phase advance in their visual response. This phase advance is most pronounced for cortical neurons indicating a role for both subcortical and cortical mechanisms.},

In particular, LGN neurons respond to visual stimuli with either burst spike responses or tonic spike responses. While much is known from in vitro studies about the cellular mechanisms that underlie burst and tonic spikes, relatively little is known about the sensory stimuli that evoke these two categories of spikes. This review examines recent progress that has been made towards understanding the spatiotemporal properties of visual stimuli that evoke burst and tonic spikes. Using white-noise stimuli and reverse-correlation analysis, results show that burst and tonic spikes carry similar, but distinct, information to cortex. Compared to tonic spikes, burst spikes (1) occur with a shorter latency between stimulus and response, (2) have a greater dependence on stimuli with transitions from suppressive to preferred states, and (3) prefer stimuli that provide increased drive to the receptive field center and even greater increased drive to the receptive field surround. These results are discussed with an emphasis placed on relating the cellular constraints for burst and tonic activity with the functional properties of the early visual pathway during sensory processing.},

We recorded the spiking activity of retinal ganglion cells and LGN neurons in the cat to test the hypothesis that extraclassical suppression influences temporal features of visual responses in the early visual system. Our results demonstrate that extraclassical suppression not only shifts the distribution of interspike intervals in a manner that decreases the efficacy of neuronal communication, it also decreases the reliability of neuronal responses to visual stimuli and it decreases the duration of visual responses, an effect that underlies a rightward shift in the temporal frequency tuning of LGN neurons. Taken together, these results reveal a dynamic relationship between extraclassical suppression and the temporal features of neuronal responses.},

This study explores the stimulus properties that evoke burst and tonic spikes and examines the reliability of LGN neurons to produce visually driven bursts. Using reverse-correlation techniques, we show that the receptive fields of burst spikes are similar to, but significantly different from, the receptive fields of tonic spikes. Compared with tonic spikes, burst spikes (1) occur with a shorter latency between stimulus and response, (2) have a greater dependence on stimuli with transitions from suppressive to preferred states, and (3) prefer stimuli that provide increased drive to the receptive field center and even greater increased drive to the receptive field surround. These differences are not attributable to the long interspike interval that precedes burst spikes, because tonic spikes with similar preceding interspike intervals also differ from burst spikes in both the spatial and temporal domains. Finally, measures of reliability are significantly greater for burst spikes than for tonic spikes with similar preceding interspike intervals. These results demonstrate that thalamic bursts contribute to sensory processing and can reliably provide the cortex with information that is similar to, but distinct from, that of tonic spikes.},

abstract = {A variety of studies in the visual system demonstrate that coarse spatial features are processed before those of fine detail. This aspect of visual processing is assumed to originate in striate cortex, where single cells exhibit a refinement of spatial frequency tuning over the duration of their response. However, in early visual pathways, well known temporal differences are present between center and surround components of receptive fields. Specifically, response latency of the receptive field center is relatively shorter than that of the surround. This spatiotemporal inseparability could provide the basis of coarse-to-fine dynamics in early and subsequent visual areas. We have investigated this possibility with three separate approaches. First, we predict spatial-frequency tuning dynamics from the spatiotemporal receptive fields of 118 cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). Second, we compare these linear predictions to measurements of tuning dynamics obtained with a subspace reverse correlation technique. We find that tuning evolves dramatically in thalamic cells, and that tuning changes are generally consistent with the temporal differences between spatiotemporal receptive field components. Third, we use a model to examine how different sources of dynamic input from early visual pathways can affect tuning in cortical cells. We identify two mechanisms capable of producing substantial dynamics at the cortical level: (1) the center-surround delay in individual LGN neurons, and (2) convergent input from multiple cells with different receptive field sizes and response latencies. Overall, our simulations suggest that coarse-to-fine tuning in the visual cortex can be generated completely by a feedforward process.},

abstract = {Inhibitory interneurons (INs) in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) provide both axonal and dendritic GABA output to thalamocortical relay cells (TCs). Distal parts of the IN dendrites often enter into complex arrangements known as triadic synapses, where the IN dendrite plays a dual role as postsynaptic to retinal input and presynaptic to TC dendrites. Dendritic GABA release can be triggered by retinal input, in a highly localized process that is functionally isolated from the soma, but can also be triggered by somatically elicited Ca(2+)-spikes and possibly by backpropagating action potentials. Ca(2+)-spikes in INs are predominantly mediated by T-type Ca(2+)-channels (T-channels). Due to the complex nature of the dendritic signalling, the function of the IN is likely to depend critically on how T-channels are distributed over the somatodendritic membrane (T-distribution). To study the relationship between the T-distribution and several IN response properties, we here run a series of simulations where we vary the T-distribution in a multicompartmental IN model with a realistic morphology. We find that the somatic response to somatic current injection is facilitated by a high T-channel density in the soma-region. Conversely, a high T-channel density in the distal dendritic region is found to facilitate dendritic signalling in both the outward direction (increases the response in distal dendrites to somatic input) and the inward direction (the soma responds stronger to distal synaptic input). The real T-distribution is likely to reflect a compromise between several neural functions, involving somatic response patterns and dendritic signalling.},

These neurons are excited by inputs from more than one sensory modality, and when multisensory stimuli are present, they can integrate their responses in a predictable manner. However, recent studies have revealed that multisensory processing in the cortex is not restricted to bimodal neurons. The present investigation sought to examine the potential for multisensory processing in nonbimodal (unimodal) neurons in the retinotopically organized posterolateral lateral suprasylvian (PLLS) area of the cat. Standard extracellular recordings were used to measure responses of all neurons encountered to both separate- and combined-modality stimulation. Whereas bimodal neurons behaved as predicted, the surprising result was that 16% of unimodal visual neurons encountered were significantly facilitated by auditory stimuli. Because these unimodal visual neurons did not respond to an auditory stimulus presented alone but had their visual responses modulated by concurrent auditory stimulation, they represent a new form of multisensory neuron: the subthreshold multisensory neuron. These data also demonstrate that bimodal neurons can no longer be regarded as the exclusive basis for multisensory processing.},

Physiological evidence for the model, however, has remained elusive. Here we demonstrate that layer IV simple cells and layer II and III complex cells show correlated firing consistent with monosynaptic connections. As expected from the hierarchical model, all connections were in the direction from the simple cell to the complex cell, most frequently between cells with similar orientation preferences.},

We have examined the specificity of these connections by recording simultaneously from layer 4 simple cells and cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus with spatially overlapping receptive fields (n = 221 cell pairs). Because of the precise retinotopic organization of visual cortex, the geniculate axons and simple-cell dendrites of these cell pairs should have overlapped within layer 4. Nevertheless, monosynaptic connections were identified in only 33% of all cases, as estimated by cross-correlation analysis. The visual responses of monosynaptically connected geniculate cells and simple cells were closely related. The probability of connection was greatest when a geniculate center overlapped a strong simple-cell subregion of the same sign (ON or OFF) near the center of the subregion. This probability was further increased when the time courses of the visual responses were similar. In addition, the connections were strongest when the simple-cell subregion and the geniculate center were matched in position, sign, and size. The rules of connectivity between geniculate afferents and simple cells resemble those found for retinal afferents to geniculate cells. The connections along the retinogeniculocortical pathway, therefore, show a precision that goes beyond simple retinotopy to include many other response properties, such as receptive-field sign, timing, subregion strength, and size. This specificity in wiring emphasizes the need for developmental mechanisms (presumably correlation-based) that can select among afferents that differ only slightly in their response properties.},

year = {2007}, 
abstract = {Under appropriate stimulus conditions, judgments about the degree of temporal synchrony in sequences containing rapid alternations of colour and motion direction imply a large apparent delay of motion perception relative to colour perception. Whether this colour-motion asynchrony results from the relative processing delay of different visual attributes, or from inappropriate matching of time markers assigned to first-order change of colour and position has been the subject of recent debate. Colour-motion asynchrony is significantly weakened when the angle of direction change is reduced from 180 degrees (direction reversal) to a smaller change in direction. Although this finding has been interpreted to favour the processing delay hypothesis, here we show that it is consistent with the time marker account. First, the reported dependence on the motion direction angle was particularly strong for random-dot stimuli, but our results indicate that this may reflect the introduction of an artefact, motion streaks, that allows subjects to make a colour-orientation synchrony judgement rather than a colour-motion synchrony judgment for direction change angles other than 180 degrees. Second, when we used streak-free plaid stimuli, a certain amount of angle dependence remained regardless of whether we asked the observers to judge the apparent binding or synchrony of colour and motion direction changes. The degree of direction change also affected reaction times, but the effect of apparent asynchrony for a direct comparison of sequences of 90 degrees and 180 degrees motion direction changes was very small, if at all present. These findings with plaid stimuli are consistent with the time marker account; in that we allow that the direction change angle can affect the time course of the recruitment of neural responses to the new direction of motion, which will have a consequential effect on the temporal location of salient features in the sequence of motion changes.},

We apply the method to recordings of inferotemporal cortical neurons of primates presented with complex visual stimuli. On this data, the minimal Poisson hypothesis is rejected: the neuronal responses are too reliable to be fit by a typical firing-rate model, even allowing for sudden, time-varying, and trial-dependent rate changes after stimulus onset. The statistical evidence favors a tightly regulated stimulus response in these neurons, close to stimulus onset, although not further away.},

During visual imagery, auditory cortex deactivation negatively correlates with activation in visual cortex and with the score in the subjective vividness of visual imagery questionnaire (VVIQ). Perception of the world requires the merging of multisensory information so that, during seeing, information from other sensory systems modifies visual cortical activity and shapes experience. We suggest that pure visual imagery corresponds to the isolated activation of visual cortical areas with concurrent deactivation of “irrelevant” sensory processing that could disrupt the image created by our “mind’s eye.”},

abstract = {The image on the retina is almost never static. Eye, head and body movements, and externally generated motion create rapid and continual changes in the retinal image (”active vision”). Virtually all vision in animals such as primates, which make saccades as often as 3-4 times/s, is based on information that must be derived from the first few hundred milliseconds after sudden, global changes in the retinal image. These changes may be accompanied by large changes in area mean luminance, as well as higher order image contrast statistics. This study investigated how retinal ganglion cell responses, whose response properties have been typically studied and defined in a stable stimulus regime, are affected by sudden changes in mean luminance that are characteristic of active vision. Specifically, the steady-state responses of retinal ganglion cells to static or moving square-wave grating stimuli were recorded in an isolated, superfused rabbit eyecup preparation and compared to responses after saccade-like changes in luminance. The manner of coding after luminance changes was different for different ganglion cell classes; both suppression and enhancement of responses to patterns following luminance changes were found. Brisk-transient Off cells unambiguously signaled the darkening of the overall image, but were also modulated by the subsequently appearing grating stimulus. Several types of On-center cell behavior were observed, ranging from strong suppression of the subsequent response by luminance changes, to strong enhancement. Overall, most ganglion cells distinguished static patterns after a luminance change via differences in their spike discharges nearly as well as before, although there were clear asymmetries between the On and Off pathways. Changes in mean luminance in some ganglion cells, such as On-Off directionally selective ganglion cells, could create large phase shifts in the response to patterned, moving stimuli, although these stimuli were still detected immediately after luminance changes. The results of this study show that the image dynamics of active vision may be a fundamental challenge for the visual system because of strong effects on retinal ganglion cell function. However, rapid extraction of unambiguous information after luminance changes appears to be encoded in differences in the spike discharges in different retinal ganglion cell classes. Asymmetries among ganglion cell classes in sensitivity to luminance changes may provide a basis by which some provide the “context” for interpreting the firing of others.},

abstract = {Motion perception is qualitatively invariant across different objects and forms, namely, the same motion information can be conveyed by many different physical carriers, and it requires the processing of motion signals consisting of direction, speed, and axis or trajectory of motion defined by a moving object. Compared with the representation of orientation, the cortical processing of these different motion signals within the early ventral visual pathway of the primate remains poorly understood. Using drifting full-field noise stimuli and intrinsic optical imaging, along with cytochrome-oxidase staining, we found that the orientation domains in macaque V1, V2, and V4 that processed orientation signals also served to process motion signals associated with the axis and speed of motion. In contrast, direction domains within the thick stripes of V2 demonstrated preferences that were independent of motion speed. The population responses encoding the orientation and motion axis could be precisely reproduced by a spatiotemporal energy model. Thus, our observation of orientation domains with dual functions in V1, V2, and V4 directly support the notion that the linear representation of the temporal series of retinotopic activations may serve as another motion processing strategy in primate ventral visual pathway, contributing directly to fine form and motion analysis. Our findings further reveal that different types of motion information are differentially processed in parallel and segregated compartments within primate early visual cortices, before these motion features are fully combined in high-tier visual areas.},

In primate V1 and V2, most neurons have small spatio-temporal receptive fields responding selectively to oriented luminance contours (first order), while only a subgroup of neurons signal non-luminance defined contours (second order). So how is the orientation of second-order contours represented at the population level in macaque V1 and V2? Here we compared the population responses in macaque V1 and V2 to two types of second-order contour stimuli generated either by modulation of contrast or phase reversal with those to first-order contour stimuli. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging, we found that the orientation of second-order contour stimuli was represented invariantly in the orientation columns of both macaque V1 and V2. A physiologically constrained spatio-temporal energy model of V1 and V2 neuronal populations could reproduce all the recorded population responses. These findings suggest that, at the population level, the primate early visual system processes the orientation of second-order contours initially through a linear spatio-temporal filter mechanism. Our results of population responses to different second-order contour stimuli support the idea that the orientation maps in primate V1 and V2 can be described as a spatial-temporal energy map.},

abstract = {All moving objects generate sequential retinotopic activations representing a series of discrete locations in space and time (motion trajectory). How direction-selective neurons in mammalian early visual cortices process motion trajectory remains to be clarified. Using single-cell recording and optical imaging of intrinsic signals along with mathematical simulation, we studied response properties of cat visual areas 17 and 18 to random dots moving at various speeds. We found that, the motion trajectory at low speed was encoded primarily as a direction signal by groups of neurons preferring that motion direction. Above certain transition speeds, the motion trajectory is perceived as a spatial orientation representing the motion axis of the moving dots. In both areas studied, above these speeds, other groups of direction-selective neurons with perpendicular direction preferences were activated to encode the motion trajectory as motion-axis information. This applied to both simple and complex neurons. The average transition speed for switching between encoding motion direction and axis was about 31°/s in area 18 and 15°/s in area 17. A spatio-temporal energy model predicted the transition speeds accurately in both areas, but not the direction-selective indexes to random-dot stimuli in area 18. In addition, above transition speeds, the change of direction preferences of population responses recorded by optical imaging can be revealed using vector maximum but not vector summation method. Together, this combined processing of motion direction and axis by neurons with orthogonal direction preferences associated with speed may serve as a common principle of early visual motion processing.},

Although a variety of work has examined how these different levels are related, there is comparatively little examination of the assumptions on which his proposed levels rest, or the plausibility of the approach Marr articulated given those assumptions. Marr placed particular significance on computational level theory, which specifies the “goal” of a computation, its appropriateness for solving a particular problem, and the logic by which it can be carried out. The structure of computational level theory is inherently teleological: What the brain does is described in terms of its purpose. I argue that computational level theory, and the reverse-engineering approach it inspires, requires understanding the historical trajectory that gave rise to functional capacities that can be meaningfully attributed with some sense of purpose or goal, that is, a reconstruction of the fitness function on which natural selection acted in shaping our visual abilities. I argue that this reconstruction is required to distinguish abilities shaped by natural selection-”natural tasks” -from evolutionary “by-products” (spandrels, co-optations, and exaptations), rather than merely demonstrating that computational goals can be embedded in a Bayesian model that renders a particular behavior or process rational.},

Although the latter two are some of the best studied synaptic connections in the brain, the former remains poorly understood both in structure and in function. By combining light and electron microscopy, we have reconstructed in 3-D single W axons and described quantitatively the synapses that they form. We have also made a structural comparison of reconstructed synapses from the three visual pathways. Thalamic axons were labeled in vivo by injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the dLGN. W axons originating from C laminae injections arborized in layers 1, 2/3, and 5. Axons that traversed layer 1 supplied a few descending collaterals to layer 2/3, but the most extensive innervation in layer 2/3 was provided by axons ascending from the white matter. Most W boutons formed a single synapse, dendritic spines being the most common target, with dendritic shafts forming the remaining targets. In layer 1, the area of the postsynaptic density of spine synapses (0.16 microm(2)) was significantly larger than that of layers 2/3 (0.11 microm(2)) and 5 (0.09 microm(2)). Synapses from X and Y axons in layer 4 were similar in size to synapses formed by W boutons in layer 1. In layer 1, the main targets of the W axons are likely the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells, so that both proximal and distal regions of pyramidal cell dendritic trees can be excited by the W pathway.},

In addition to its role in directing saccadic eye movements, it is the source of an attentional signal that modulates the activity of neurons in extrastriate and parietal cortex. Here, we tested the prediction that FEF preferentially excites inhibitory neurons in target areas during attentional modulation. Using the anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine, we found that the projections from FEF terminate in all cortical layers of area 46, lateral intraparietal area (LIP), and visual area V4. Axons in layer 1 spread extensively, those in layer 2/3 were most numerous, individual axons in layer 4 formed sprays of collaterals, and those of the deep layers were the finest caliber and irregular. All labeled synapses were the typical asymmetric morphology of excitatory synapses of pyramidal neurons. Dendritic spines were the most frequent synaptic target in all areas (95% in area 46, 89% in V4, 84% in LIP, 78% intrinsic local FEF). The remaining targets were one soma and dendritic shafts, most of which showed characteristics of inhibitory neurons with smooth dendrites (5% of all targets in area 46, 2% in V4, 9% in LIP, and 13% in FEF).},

abstract = {The feedback from layer 6 of V1 to the magno and parvocellular LGN in primates provides a substrate for the rapid modulation of their response properties (Sillito et al. 2006, Briggs and Usrey 2007) and a means for the reflected influence of the cortical processing mechanism to engage the flow of visual information from the retina. In the feline visual system it has been suggested that it enhances center-surround interactions driven by moving stimuli (Murphy and Sillito 1987, Sillito et al. 2006) but it is not clear that this applies in the primate visual system (Sceniak et al. 2006, Alitto and Usrey 2008). We have used pharmacological techniques to probe the influence of the feedback from layer 6 on spatial summation in parvocellular LGN cells. Firstly, we observed the effect of using focal iontophoretic application of GABA to block activity of layer 6 cells in V1 at retinotopic locations overlying the receptive fields of simultaneously recorded parvocellular LGN cells. This changed the way parvocellular LGN cells responded to patches of drifting grating of varying diameter. In particular for some cells it influenced the response to stimuli that fell within the spatial extent of the center mechanism. Thus these responses were reduced when the overlying layer 6 cells were blocked and enhanced when the blockade was removed. This appeared to be an in-line facilitation of the center response to moving stimuli driven by layer 6. The feedback terminals from layer 6 cells in V1 to the LGN are uniquely associated with mGluR1 receptors and so one might predict that a component of their effect is mediated by mGluR1 receptors. Secondly, we have observed that by using iontophoretic techniques to change the level of mGluR1 receptor activation in the LGN we can mimic some of the effects of the feedback on the visual responses of parvocellular LGN cells. This observation is consistent with a previous report in the feline visual system (Rivadulla et al. 2002). Thus for small moving stimuli, the primary effect of the feedback from layer 6 seems to be linked to a focal in-line facilitation of LGN visual responses. This suggests the capacity for a very discrete modulation of focal activity by the feedback.},

abstract = {Relay cells in cat LGN are contacted by single or few afferent retinal inputs, and therefore broadly share similar RF spatial dimensions. Response changes that occur at the level of the visual thalamus are largely described in terms of a modulation in both spatial and temporal domains; feedback from the visual cortex contributes to this transformation (Sillito et al., 2006). Cortical feedback afferents contact thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) cells, and intrinsic inhibitory interneurons and relay cells. Given the substantial contribution of cortical feedback terminals (direct and indirect), we wanted to finely map RF structure of relay cells on removal of their influence. We utilized local infusion of muscimol, a potent GABAA agonist, in areas 17, 18 and 19 of feline visual cortex and mapped LGN RFs using small spots of light displaced in Cartesian coordinate space. To our surprise we found relay cell RFs responded with excitatory driving over a much larger area of visual space than control RFs. Using areal measurement of significant responses, RF area rose from 0.92°2±0.15 SE (n=29) to 5.31°2±0.92 SE (n=27) when removing feedback; this effect was seen for both X and Y cells. When we isolated responses into burst and tonic components, we found tonic-firing derived area was largely unchanged, but surrounding it was an annular region in which visual stimulation elicited bursts; this annular region contributed significantly to the areal enlargement. There was often a temporal offset between the central tonic and surrounding burst response. A parsimonious hypothesis, given little RGC convergence, is that the enlarged RFs map an extended inhibitory field, in which a rebound hyper-polarizing event drives temporally offset burst responses. Because of the extended spatial configuration, these most probably derive from TRN. In summary, this data maps an extended surround that, though certainly sub-threshold (i.e. modulatory) during normal operation, reveal input over areas of visual space significantly larger than the classically defined RF itself.},

abstract = {Neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) respond best to oriented gratings of optimal size within their receptive field (RF) and are suppressed by larger gratings involving the nonclassical RF surround. A V1 neuron’s optimal stimulus size is larger at lower stimulus contrast. A central question in visual neuroscience is what circuits generate the size tuning of V1 cells. We recently demonstrated that V1 horizontal connections integrate signals within a region of the RF center corresponding to the V1 neuron’s optimal stimulus size at low contrast; extrastriate feedback connections to V1, instead, are longer range and can integrate signals from the most distant regions of the V1 cell’s RF surround. Here, we have determined the contribution of geniculocortical feedforward and corticogeniculate feedback connections to the size-tuning of macaque V1 and lateral geniculate (LGN) neurons, respectively. Specifically, we have quantitatively compared the visuotopic extent of geniculate feedforward afferents to V1 with the size of the RF center and surround of neurons in the V1 input layers and the visuotopic extent of V1 feedback connections to the LGN with the RF size of cells in V1 layer 6, where these connections originate. We find geniculate feedforward connections to provide visuotopic information to V1 that is spatially coextensive with the V1 neuron’s optimal stimulus size measured with high-contrast gratings. V1 feedback connections restrict their influence to an LGN region visuotopically coextensive with the size of the minimum response field (or classical RF) of V1 layer 6 cells and commensurate with the LGN region from which they receive feedforward connections.},

abstract = {Directing spatial attention to a location inside the classical receptive field (cRF) of a neuron in macaque medial temporal area (MT) shifts the center of the cRF toward the attended location. Here we investigate the influence of spatial attention on the profile of the inhibitory surround present in many MT neurons. Two monkeys attended to the fixation point or to 1 of 2 random dot patterns (RDPs) placed inside or next to the cRF, whereas a third RDP (the probe) was briefly presented in quick succession across the cRF and surround. The probe presentation responses were used to compute a map of the excitatory receptive field and its inhibitory surround. Attention systematically reshapes the receptive field profile, independently shifting both center and surround toward the attended location. Furthermore, cRF size is changed as a function of relative distance to the attentional focus: attention inside the cRF shrinks it, whereas directing attention next to the cRF expands it. In addition, we find systematic changes in surround inhibition and cRF amplitude. This nonmultiplicative push-pull modulation of the receptive field’s center-surround structure optimizes processing at and near the attentional focus to strengthen the representation of the attended stimulus while reducing influences from distractors.},

abstract = {Fast-moving visual features are thought to leave neural ‘streaks’ that can be detected by orientation-selective cells. Here, we tested whether ‘motion streaks’ can induce classic tilt aftereffects (TAEs) and tilt illusions (TIs). For TAEs, participants adapted to random arrays of small Gaussian blobs drifting at 9.5 deg/s. Following adaptation to directions of 15, 30, 45, 60, 75, and 90 degrees (clockwise from vertical) subjective vertical was measured for a briefly presented test grating. For TIs, the same motions were presented in an annular surround and subjective vertical was measured for a simultaneously presented central grating. All motions were 50% coherent, with half the blobs following random-walk paths and half following a fixed direction. Strong and weak streaks were compared by varying streak length (the number of fixed-walk frames), rather than by manipulating speed, so that speed and coherence were matched in all conditions. Strong motion streaks produced robust TAEs and TIs, similar in magnitude and orientation tuning to those induced by tilted lines. These effects were weak or absent in weak streak conditions, and when motion was too slow to form streaks. Together, these results indicate that motion streaks produced by temporal integration of fast translating features do effectively adapt orientation-selective cells and may therefore be exploited to improve perception of motion direction as described in the ‘motion streaks’ model.},

Suppression depth was quantified by expressing monocular probe thresholds during dominance relative to thresholds during suppression. Rivalry between two fast motions or two slow motions was compared in order to test the suggestion that fast-moving objects leave oriented “motion streaks” due to temporal integration (W. S. Geisler, 1999). If fast motions do produce motion streaks, then fast motion rivalry might also entail rivalry between the orthogonal streak orientations. We tested this using a static oriented probe that was aligned either parallel to the motion trajectory (hence collinear with the “streaks”) or was orthogonal to the trajectory, predicting that rivalry suppression would be greater for parallel probes, and only for rivalry between fast motions. Results confirmed that suppression depth did depend on probe orientation for fast motion but not for slow motion. Further experiments showed that threshold elevations for the oriented probe during suppression exhibited clear orientation tuning. However, orientation-tuned elevations were also present during dominance, suggesting within-channel masking as the basis of the extra-deep suppression. In sum, the presence of orientation-dependent suppression in fast motion rivalry is consistent with the “motion streaks” hypothesis.},

abstract = {We investigated whether the oriented trails of blur left by fast-moving dots (i.e., “motion streaks”) effectively mask grating targets. Using a classic overlay masking paradigm, we varied mask contrast and target orientation to reveal underlying tuning. Fast-moving Gaussian blob arrays elevated thresholds for detection of static gratings, both monoptically and dichoptically. Monoptic masking at high mask (i.e., streak) contrasts is tuned for orientation and exhibits a similar bandwidth to masking functions obtained with grating stimuli (approximately 30 degrees). Dichoptic masking fails to show reliable orientation-tuned masking, but dichoptic masks at very low contrast produce a narrowly tuned facilitation (approximately 17 degrees). For iso-oriented streak masks and grating targets, we also explored masking as a function of mask contrast. Interestingly, dichoptic masking shows a classic “dipper”-like TVC function, whereas monoptic masking shows no dip and a steeper “handle”. There is a very strong unoriented component to the masking, which we attribute to transiently biased temporal frequency masking. Fourier analysis of “motion streak” images shows interesting differences between dichoptic and monoptic functions and the information in the stimulus. Our data add weight to the growing body of evidence that the oriented blur of motion streaks contributes to the processing of fast motion signals.},

While human psychophysics and single-unit studies in non-human primates are consistent with this hypothesis, direct neural evidence from the human cortex is still lacking. First, we provide psychophysical evidence that faster and slower motions are processed by distinct neural mechanisms: faster motion raised human perceptual thresholds for static orientations parallel to the direction of motion, whereas slower motion raised thresholds for orthogonal orientations. We then used functional magnetic resonance imaging to measure brain activity while human observers viewed either fast (’streaky’) or slow random dot stimuli moving in different directions, or corresponding static-oriented stimuli. We found that local spatial patterns of brain activity in early retinotopic visual cortex reliably distinguished between static orientations. Critically, a multivariate pattern classifier trained on brain activity evoked by these static stimuli could then successfully distinguish the direction of fast (’streaky’) but not slow motion. Thus, signals encoding static-oriented streak information are present in human early visual cortex when viewing fast motion. These experiments show that motion streaks are present in the human visual system for faster motion.},

These corticogeniculate projection neurons (CG cells) receive top-down synaptic inputs from upper layers (ULs) and bottom-up inputs from the underlying white matter (WM). Use-dependent plasticity of these synapses in layer VI of the cortex has received less attention than in other layers. In the present study, we used a retrograde tracer injected into dLGN to identify CG cells, and, by analyzing EPSPs evoked by electrical stimulation of the UL or WM site, examined whether these synapses show long-term synaptic plasticity. Theta-burst stimulation induced long-term potentiation (LTP) of activated synapses (hom-LTP) and long-term depression (LTD) of nonactivated synapses (het-LTD) in either pathway. The paired-pulse stimulation protocol and the analysis of coefficient variation of EPSPs suggested postsynaptic induction of these changes except UL-induced het-LTD, which may be presynaptic in origin. Intracellular injection of a Ca(2+)-chelator suggested an involvement of postsynaptic Ca(2+) rise in all types of long-term plasticity. Pharmacological analysis indicated that NMDA receptors and type-5 metabotropic glutamate receptors are involved in WM-induced and UL-induced plasticity, respectively. Analysis with inhibitors and/or in transgenic mice suggested an involvement of cannabinoid type 1 receptors and calcineurin in UL-induced and WM-induced het-LTD, respectively. These results suggest that hom-LTP and het-LTD may play a role in switching the top-down or bottom-up regulation of CG cell function and/or in maintaining stability of synaptic transmission efficacy through different molecular mechanisms.},

Although spines biochemically isolate inputs, nonspiny neurons can also implement biochemical compartmentalization; so, it is possible that spines have an additional function. We have recently shown that the spine neck can filter membrane potentials going into and out of the spine. To investigate the potential function of this electrical filtering, we used two-photon uncaging of glutamate and compared the integration of electrical signals in spines vs. dendritic shafts from basal dendrites of mouse layer 5 pyramidal neurons. Uncaging potentials onto spines summed linearly, whereas potentials on dendritic shafts reduced each other’s effect. Linear integration of spines was maintained regardless of the amplitude of the response, distance between spines (as close as <2 microm), distance of the spines to the soma, dendritic diameter, or spine neck length. Our findings indicate that spines serve as electrical isolators to prevent input interaction, and thus generate a linear arithmetic of excitatory inputs. Linear integration could be an essential feature of cortical and other spine-laden circuits.},

Our data demonstrated that: 1) GABAergic local circuit neurons were detected in the thalamic visual domain in all the species analyzed, whereas in other thalamic nuclei their presence and number varied among species; 2) the number of GABAergic local circuit neurons progressively increased in the dorsal thalamus of species with more complex behavior; 3) the presence of local circuit neurons conferred a similar intrinsic organization to the dorsal thalamic nuclei, characterized by complex synaptic arrangements; 4) in the reticular thalamic nucleus, whose neurons were GABA-immunoreactive in all the examined species, the cellular density decreased from the bat to humans. These findings strongly suggest that thalamic GABAergic local circuit neurons are not directly related to the ability to perform specific sensorimotor tasks, but they are likely to reflect an increasing complexity of the local information processing that occurs at thalamic level.

We show that regulation of excitability by sodium pumps is necessary for the neuron to make different responses depending on the statistical context of the stimuli. In particular, sodium-pump activity allowed spike-burst sizes and rates to code not for stimulus values per se, but for their ratio with the standard deviation of the stimulus distribution. Modeling further showed that sodium pumps can be a general mechanism of adaptation to statistics on the time scale of 1 min. These results implicate the ubiquitous pump activity in the adaptation of neural codes to statistics.},

This observation has prompted the proposal that changes in colour are processed faster and perceived as occurring before physically coincident changes in direction-a brain-time account. Alternatively, it has been proposed that the sudden onset of a surface, or a direction reversal within a persistent surface, can trigger an analysis that determines the perceptual properties of the surface. Hypothetically, this analysis persists for some period of time and the consequences are perceived as having occurred when the analysis commenced-a post-dictive account. Hypotheses based upon these alternate accounts are contrasted in a series of experiments. It is shown that the optimal conditions for pairing specific combinations of colour and motion arise when colour changes are delayed relative to direction changes. In these conditions observers can pair more rapid oscillations of colour and motion and perceptual pairings are more systematic relative to when the changes in colour and direction are physically synchronous. It is also shown that, when pairing colour and motion, the sudden onset of a moving surface does not have the same consequences as a direction reversal within a persistent surface. These findings are consistent with the brain-time, but are inconsistent with the post-dictive, account of perceptual asynchrony.},

Here, we show that our sense of relative timing for combinations of visual changes is similarly pliant. We find that direction reversals can be made to seem synchronous with unusually early colour changes after prolonged exposure to a stimulus wherein colour changes precede direction changes. The opposite effect is induced by prolonged exposure to colour changes that lag direction changes. Our data are consistent with the proposal that our sense of timing for changes encoded by distinct sensory mechanisms can adjust, at least to some degree, to the prevailing environment.

To determine the response features that reliably discriminate these stimuli, we use the metric-space approach extended to pairs of neurons. We find that paying attention to the times of individual spikes, at a resolution of [~]30 ms, and keeping track of which neuron fires which spike rather than just the summed local activity contribute substantially to phase coding. The contribution is both quantitative (increasing the fidelity of phase coding) and qualitative (enabling a 2-dimensional “response space” that corresponds to the spatial phase cycle). We use a novel approach, the extraction of “temporal profiles” from the metric space analysis, to interpret and compare temporal coding across neurons. Temporal profiles were remarkably consistent across a large subset of neurons. This consistency indicates that simple mechanisms (e.g., comparing the size of the transient and sustained components of the response) allow the temporal contribution to phase coding to be decoded},

When odor concentration changes, feedforward inhibition modulates the duration of the temporal window over which the mushroom body neurons may integrate excitatory presynaptic input.

abstract = {The vertebrate retina has two conceptually distinct functions. First, it converts light into
an electrical signal in the photoreceptors, the rods and cones. Secondly, it processes this
signal to remove unimportant information, and thereby reduces the number of neural
connexions needed to connect the retina to higher visual centres in the brain. In this article
I will describe these functional aspects of the first three cell layers of the visual system: the
photoreceptors, horizontal cells and bipolar cells, which together comprise the outer retina.
The thesis of this article is that the study of ion channels in retinal cells is a useful
approach to understanding early visual processing. In order to predict the response of a
retinal neurone to generalized input stimuli, it is necessary to obtain a quantitative
description of the membrane currents in that cell. By examining the way in which these
currents shape the visual signal, one can then ask what advantages are conferred on the
visual system by having a particular class of ion channel present in a particular neurone.
Recent advances in methods for studying cells isolated from the retina, and in slices of
retina (Werblin, 1978; Bader, MacLeish & Schwartz, 1978), and the application of
patch-clamp methods (Hamill, Marty, Neher, Sakmann & Sigworth, 1981), have rapidly
expanded our knowledge of the ion channels in retinal cell membranes. The following
sections review the properties of these channels, and assess how the presence of each type
of channel will result in processing of the visual signal. The processing which occurs is
characterized in terms of the spatial and temporal filtering carried out on the signal, and
the resulting limitations imposed on visual perception. The function of the signal processing
performed by the outer retina is assessed at the end of this article.},

abstract = {An optimal visual stimulus flashed on the receptive field of a retinal ganglion cell typically evokes a strong transient response followed by weaker sustained firing. Thalamocortical (TC) neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, which receive their sensory input from retina, respond similarly except that the gain, in particular of the sustained component, changes with level of arousal. Several lines of evidence suggest that retinal input to TC neurons through NMDA receptors plays a key role in generation of the sustained response, but the mechanisms for the state-dependent variation in this component are unclear. We used a slice preparation to study responses of TC neurons evoked by trains of electrical pulses to the retinal afferents at frequencies in the range of visual responses in vivo. Despite synaptic depression, the pharmacologically isolated NMDA component gave a pronounced build-up of depolarization through temporal summation of the NMDA receptor mediated EPSPs. This depolarization could provide sustained firing, the frequency of which depended on the holding potential. We suggest that the variation of sustained response in vivo is caused mainly by the state-dependent modulation of the membrane potential of TC neurons which shifts the NMDA receptor mediated depolarization closer to or further away from the firing threshold. The pharmacologically isolated AMPA receptor EPSPs were rather ineffective in spike generation. However, together with the depolarization evoked by the NMDA component, the AMPA component contributed significantly to spike generation, and was necessary for the precise timing of the generated spikes.},

abstract = {Neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) process and transmit visual signals from retina to visual cortex. The processing is dynamically regulated by cortical excitatory feedback to neurons in dLGN, and synaptic short-term plasticity (STP) has an important role in this regulation. It is known that corticogeniculate synapses on thalamocortical (TC) projection-neurons are facilitating, but type and characteristics of STP of synapses on inhibitory interneurons in dLGN are unknown. We studied STP at corticogeniculate synapses on interneurons and compared the results with STP-characteristics of corticogeniculate synapses on TC neurons to gain insights into the dynamics of cortical regulation of processing in dLGN. We studied neurons in thalamic slices from glutamate decarboxylase 67 (GAD67)-green fluorescent protein (GFP) knock-in mice and made whole-cell recordings of responses evoked by electrical paired-pulse and pulse train stimulation of cortical afferents. We found that cortical excitations of interneurons and TC neurons have distinctly different properties. A single pulse evoked larger EPSCs in interneurons than in TC neurons. However, repetitive stimulation induced frequency-dependent depression of interneurons in contrast to the facilitation of TC neurons. Thus, through these differences of STP mechanisms, the balance of cortical excitation of the two types of neurons could change during stimulation from strongest excitation of interneurons to strongest excitation of TC neurons depending on stimulus frequency and duration, and thereby contribute to activity-dependent cortical regulation of thalamocortical transmission between net depression and net facilitation. Studies of postsynaptic response patterns of interneurons to train stimulation demonstrated that cortical input can activate different types of neuronal integration mechanisms that in addition to the STP mechanisms may change the output from dLGN. Lower stimulus intensity, presumably activating few cortical afferents, or moderate frequencies, elicited summation of graded EPSPs reflecting synaptic depression. However, strong activation through higher intensity or frequency, elicited complex response patterns in interneurons caused at least partly by activation of calcium conductances.},

abstract = {Zen Buddhist meditative practices emphasize the long-term, mindful training of attention and awareness during one’s ordinary daily-life activities, the shedding of egocentric behaviors, and the skillful application of one’s innate compassionate resources of insight-wisdom toward others and oneself. This review focuses on how such a comprehensive approach to training the brain could relate to a distinctive flavor of Zen: its emphasis on direct experience, with special reference to those major acute states of awakening that create deep transformations of consciousness and behavior. In Japanese, these advanced states are called kensho and satori. Ten key concepts are reviewed. They begin by distinguishing between the concentrative and receptive forms of meditation, noticing the complementary ways that they each train our normal “top-down” and “bottom-up” modes of attentive processing. Additional concepts distinguish between our two major processing pathways. The self-centered, egocentric frame of reference processes information in relation to our body (our soma) or to our mental functions (our psyche). The other-centered frame of reference processes information anonymously. Its prefix, allo- simply means “other” in Greek. Subsequent concepts consider how these useful Greek words-ego/allo, soma/psyche-correlate with the normal functional anatomy of important thalamo <--> cortical connections. A plausible model then envisions how a triggering stimulus that captures attention could prompt the reticular nucleus to release GABA; how its selective inhibition of the dorsal thalamus could then block both our higher somatic and psychic cortical functions; so as to: (a) delete the maladaptive aspects of selfhood, while also (b) releasing the direct, all-inclusive, globally-unified experience of other. Two final concepts consider how the long-term meditative training of intuitive functions relates to certain kinds of word-free spatial tasks that involve insightful creative problem-solving.},

abstract = {Sensory systems use adaptive coding mechanisms to filter redundant information from the environment to efficiently represent the external world. One such mechanism found in most sensory neurons is rate adaptation, defined as a reduction in firing rate in response to a constant stimulus. In auditory nerve, this form of adaptation is likely mediated by exhaustion of release-ready synaptic vesicles in the cochlear hair cell. To better understand how specific synaptic mechanisms limit neural coding strategies, we examined the trial-to-trial variability of auditory nerve responses during short-term rate-adaptation by measuring spike-timing precision and spike-count reliability. After adaptation, precision remained unchanged, whereas for all but the lowest-frequency fibers, reliability decreased. Modeling statistical properties of the hair cell-afferent fiber synapse suggested that the ability of one or a few vesicles to elicit an action potential reduces the inherent response variability expected from quantal neurotransmitter release, and thereby confers the observed count reliability at sound onset. However, with adaptation, depletion of the readily releasable pool of vesicles diminishes quantal content and antagonizes the postsynaptic enhancement of reliability. These findings imply that during the course of short-term adaptation, coding strategies that employ a rate code are constrained by increased neural noise because of vesicle depletion, whereas those that employ a temporal code are not.},

Although the number of neurons is generally assumed to be a determinant of computational power, and despite the widespread quotes that the human brain contains 100 billion neurons and ten times more glial cells, the absolute number of neurons and glial cells in the human brain remains unknown. Here we determine these numbers by using the isotropic fractionator and compare them with the expected values for a human-sized primate. We find that the adult male human brain contains on average 86.1 +/- 8.1 billion NeuN-positive cells (”neurons”) and 84.6 +/- 9.8 billion NeuN-negative (”nonneuronal”) cells. With only 19% of all neurons located in the cerebral cortex, greater cortical size (representing 82% of total brain mass) in humans compared with other primates does not reflect an increased relative number of cortical neurons. The ratios between glial cells and neurons in the human brain structures are similar to those found in other primates, and their numbers of cells match those expected for a primate of human proportions. These findings challenge the common view that humans stand out from other primates in their brain composition and indicate that, with regard to numbers of neuronal and nonneuronal cells, the human brain is an isometrically scaled-up primate brain.},

abstract = {Gain modulation is a ubiquitous phenomenon in cortical neurons, providing flexibility to operate under changing conditions. The prevailing view is that this modulation reflects a change in the relationship between mean input and output firing rate brought about by variation in neuronal membrane characteristics. An alternative mechanism is proposed for neuronal gain modulation that takes into account the capability of cortical neurons to process spatiotemporal synaptic correlations. Through the use of numerical simulations, it is shown that voltage-gated and leak conductances, membrane potential, noise, and input firing rate modify the sensitivity of cortical neurons to the degree of temporal correlation between their synaptic inputs. These changes are expressed in a change of the temporal window for synaptic integration and the range of input correlation over which response probability is graded. The study also demonstrates that temporal integration depends on the distance between the inputs and that this interplay of space and time is modulated by voltage-gated and leak conductances. Thus, gain modulation may reflect a change in the relationship between spatiotemporal synaptic correlations and output firing probability. It is further proposed that by acting synergistically with the network, dynamic spatiotemporal synaptic integration in cortical neurons may serve a functional role in the formation of dynamic cell assemblies.},

abstract = {Cortical neurons recorded in vivo exhibit highly variable responses to the repeated presentation of the same stimulus. To further understand the cellular mechanisms underlying this phenomenon, we performed intracellular recordings from neurons in cat striate cortex in vivo and examined the relationships between spontaneous activity and visually evoked responses. Activity was assessed on a trial-by-trial basis by measuring the membrane potential (Vm) fluctuations and spike activity during brief epochs immediately before and after the onset of an evoked response. We found that the response magnitude, expressed as a change in Vm relative to baseline, was linearly correlated with the preceding spontaneous Vm. This correlation was enhanced when the cells were hyperpolarized to reduce the activation of voltage- gated conductances. The output of the cells, expressed as spike counts and latencies, was only moderately correlated with fluctuations in the preceding spontaneous Vm. Spike-triggered averaging of Vm revealed that visually evoked action potentials arise from transient depolarizations having a rise time of approximately 10 msec. Consistent with this, evoked spike count was found to be linearly correlated with the magnitude of Vm fluctuations in the gamma (20-70 Hz) frequency band. We also found that the threshold of visually evoked action potentials varied over a range of approximately 10 mV. Examination of simultaneously recorded intracellular and extracellular activity revealed a correlation between Vm depolarization and spike discharges in adjacent cells. Together these results demonstrate that response variability is attributable largely to coherent fluctuations in cortical activity preceding the onset of a stimulus, but also to variations in action potential threshold and the magnitude of high-frequency fluctuations evoked by the stimulus Type : Journal article type: Eng},

They can synchronize their firing on a millisecond time scale and follow rapid stimulus fluctuations with high temporal precision. These findings suggest that cortical neurons have an enhanced sensitivity to synchronous synaptic inputs that lead to rapid rates of depolarization. The voltage-gated currents underlying action potential generation may provide one mechanism to amplify rapid depolarizations. We have tested this hypothesis by analyzing the relations between membrane potential fluctuations and spike threshold in cat visual cortical neurons recorded intracellularly in vivo. We find that visual stimuli evoke broad variations in spike threshold that are caused in large part by an inverse relation between spike threshold and the rate of membrane depolarization preceding a spike. We also find that spike threshold is inversely related to the rate of rise of the action potential upstroke, suggesting that increases in spike threshold result from a decrease in the availability of Na(+) channels. By using a simple neuronal model, we show that voltage-gated Na(+) and K(+) conductances endow cortical neurons with an enhanced sensitivity to rapid depolarizations that arise from synchronous excitatory synaptic inputs. Thus, the basic mechanism responsible for action potential generation also enhances the sensitivity of cortical neurons to coincident synaptic inputs Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

abstract = {Understanding how ensembles of neurons represent and transmit information in the patterns of their joint spiking activity is a fundamental question in computational neuroscience. At present, analyses of spiking activity from neuronal ensembles are limited because multivariate point process (MPP) models cannot represent simultaneous occurrences of spike events at an arbitrarily small time resolution. Solo recently reported a simultaneous-event multivariate point process (SEMPP) model to correct this key limitation. In this paper, we show how Solo’s discrete-time formulation of the SEMPP model can be efficiently fit to ensemble neural spiking activity using a multinomial generalized linear model (mGLM). Unlike existing approximate procedures for fitting the discrete-time SEMPP model, the mGLM is an exact algorithm. The MPP time-rescaling theorem can be used to assess model goodness-of-fit. We also derive a new marked point-process (MkPP) representation of the SEMPP model that leads to new thinning and time-rescaling algorithms for simulating an SEMPP stochastic process. These algorithms are much simpler than multivariate extensions of algorithms for simulating a univariate point process, and could not be arrived at without the MkPP representation. We illustrate the versatility of the SEMPP model by analyzing neural spiking activity from pairs of simultaneously-recorded rat thalamic neurons stimulated by periodic whisker deflections, and by simulating SEMPP data. In the data analysis example, the SEMPP model demonstrates that whisker motion significantly modulates simultaneous spiking activity at the 1 ms time scale and that the stimulus effect is more than one order of magnitude greater for simultaneous activity compared with non-simultaneous activity. Together, the mGLM, the MPP time-rescaling theorem and the MkPP representation of the SEMPP model offer a theoretically sound, practical tool for measuring joint spiking propensity in a neuronal ensemble.},

To address the extent of influence of these indirect sources on the response properties of the LGN neurons, we fit a Generalized Linear Model (GLM) to the spike responses of cat LGN neurons driven by spatially homogeneous spots that were rapidly modulated by a pseudorandom luminance sequence. Several spot sizes were used to probe the spatial extent of the indirect visual effects. Our extracellular recordings captured both the LGN spikes and the incoming RGC input (S potentials), allowing us to divide the inputs to the GLM into two categories: the direct RGC input and the indirect input to which we have access through the luminance of the visual stimulus. For spots no larger than the receptive field center, the effect of the indirect input is negligible, while for larger spots its effect can, on average, account for 5% of the variance of the data and for as much as 25% in some cells. The polarity of the indirect visual influence is opposite to that of the linear receptive field of the neurons. We conclude that the indirect source of response modulation of the LGN relay neurons arises from inhibitory sources, compatible with thalamic interneurons or TRN.},

abstract = {In vivo studies suggest that precise firing of neurons is important for correct sensory representation. Principal neocortical neurons fire imprecisely when repeatedly activated by fixed sensory stimuli or current depolarizations. Here we show that in contrast to pyramidal neurons, firing in neocortical GABAergic fast-spiking (FS) interneurons is quite precise. FS interneurons are self-innervated by powerful GABAergic autaptic connections reliably activated after each spike, suggesting that autapses strongly regulate FS-cell spike timing. Indeed, blockade of autaptic transmission degraded temporal precision in multiple ways. Under these conditions, realistic dynamic-clamp hyperpolarizing autapses restored precision of spike timing, even in the presence of synaptic noise. Furthermore, firing precision was increased in pyramidal neurons by artificial GABAergic autaptic conductances, suggesting that tightly coupled synaptic feedback inhibition regulates spike timing in principal cells. Thus, well-timed inhibition, whether autaptic or synaptic, facilitates precise spike timing and promotes synchronized cortical network oscillations relevant to several behaviors.},

journal = {Front Psychol},

year = {2014}, 
abstract = {Over the last decades many researchers have used concepts like “feedback,” “reentrance,” “backpropagation,” “top–down (modulation),” or “reverse hierarchy” to specify the mechanisms that underlie various visual phenomena (e.g., Di Lollo et al., 2000; Lamme and Roelfsema, 2000;Pascual-Leone and Walsh, 2001; Supèr et al., 2001; Ro et al., 2003; Ahissar and Hochstein, 2004;Bar et al., 2006; Fahrenfort et al., 2007; Koivisto, 2012). An incomplete list of these phenomena includes visual (object substitution) masking, shape discrimination, illusory contours, illusory motion, priming effects, etc. Empirical evidence or theoretical argumentation in favor of the suggested mechanismic explanations mainly consists in finding or postulating an association between a temporally delayed, secondary activition of lower level neural units with correct reports of target stimuli, even though the higher level neural units in the processing hierarchy were already activated earlier. On that basis, feedforward processing has been argued to be insufficient for target perception. However, in most of the studies the relative temporal order of activity at different levels alone is taken as proof of reentrant modulation without precisely measuring the neural sources of this top–down effect. In principle, it is equally possible that the source of the higher level activity from which the top–down signals are sent back to earlier feature-encoding neural units (i) is specifically linked to those features by virtue of constituting the higher level nodes associated with specific attributes of the target stimulus (thus mediating feature-binding for object integration) or (ii) is not specifically linked in this manner. In the latter case, the source of top–down modulation may be the result of the arousal or alerting boost triggered by the target stimulus via feedforward collateral activation of subcortical reticulo-thalamic units, which in turn is followed by the cortical spread of the thalamocortical activation, including the downpropagation of the non-specific wave of modulation to the early cortical areas. The non-specific system functions include arousal, attentional modulation, intercortical synchronization of neural activity, bringing the preconsciously processed specific content to awareness, “event-holding” the content in working memory, and alerting subjects to newly appearing objects and changes (Magoun, 1958; Purpura, 1970; Purpura and Schiff, 1997;Jones, 2001; Llinás and Ribary, 2001; Van der Werf et al., 2002; Ribary, 2005; Schiff et al., 2013;Saalmann, 2014). This non-specific system (NSP) targets layer-1 apical dendrites of the layer-5 and -6 pyramidal neurons. But since NSP-modulation is directed at the cortical neurons with specific representational functions, its function may go unacknowledged because the cortical units, when activated by NSP-modulation, can produce content-specific subjective effects misleading us to believe that the entire process has been specific throughout.
The focus of the present paper will be on the experimental-behavioral and neurobiological evidence in comparing the two processing modes, (i) and (ii), with arguments from computational modeling left for some other occasion.
It is known that reticulo-thalamic, intralaminar and other matrix cells of the NSP project more heavily to lateral and frontal cortical areas and less so to the primary visual areas. (Even when rare examples of direct intralaminar-thalamic input to V1 were documented, these afferents were found to be much sparser than the more frontal ones—Miller and Benevento, 1979.) Moreover, this more rostrally directed thalamo-cortical flow can cause cortical responses as fast as or even faster than the afferent volleys through the specific geniculo-cortical pathways ignite primary visual cortical responses strongly enough (Kennedy and Baleydier, 1977; Kaufman and Rosenquist, 1985;Herkenham, 1986; Cruikshank et al., 2012; Liang et al., 2013; Saalmann, 2014). Thus, the primary cortical areas receive NSP-modulation not directly, but via the higher level cortical neurons that project onto apical parts of the layer-5 pyramidal neurons in the lower cortical areas. Consequently, as illustrated in Figure 1, we have two principal modes through which lower level neural units L responsible for encoding sensory features of perceptual objects receive top–down input from higher levels H: (i) from the specific nodes in H that were previously activated by L in a cortical feedforward manner and that now send reentrant signals back to L (here the feedforward-reentrant loop pertains to the specific sensory-perceptual attributes constituting a perceptual object LH); and (ii) from the generic nodes G that were activated by the boost of the NSP directed at the more frontal and mid-level cortical neurons that now send their downpropagating wave to the lower level visual areas, including L.

Figure 1

Figure 1. Two alternative modes (i, ii) of top–down effects within the hierarchical perceptual processing system featuring specific low level neural units L, higher level specific nodes H, and a generic non-specific activation G boosted by the non-specific thalamocortical afference from NSP.


When analyzing the experimental data from most of the studies that propose specific top–down linkages (i), there is no direct evidence that would invalidate the alternative, non-specific theory of downpropagation (ii). The specificity of visual experiences is due to the fact that the NSP-modulation arrives at specific early units L and may not be due to the specificity of the higher level from where this modulation arrives. Although the direct input from NSP to L may be weak, the top–down input from higher levels H/G driven by NSP may be strong enough to emphasize the specificity of the visual experience encoded in L. The pending task should be to try disentangle these two explanations experimentally. The experiments should ascertain whether the two modes of top–down modulation are incompatible or mutually complementary. In the latter case—how the two types of downpropagation are specifically combined and what relative roles each of them has? It is also possible that the standard views of reentrance (e.g., Di Lollo et al., 2000; Lamme and Roelfsema, 2000) may be valid in some empirical instances, difficult to ascertain in some other cases, and incompatible with the neurophysiological realities of processing in different experiments. Let me comment on some examples of typical experiments aimed at supporting the standard views of reentrance listed below and see whether version (i) should be exclusively preferred or whether versions (i) and (ii) both are compatible with the experimental results.
  1. In typical object substitution masking (OSM) a target stimulus (e.g., a Landolt C) is presented together with four dots that surround the target. When after a very brief delay the target is switched off, the four dots either are also switched off or remain displayed for varing duration acting as a post-mask (the simultaneous onset, asynchronous offset condition.) The delayed-offset condition leads to strong masking but in the simultaneous-offset condition masking is weak. The classic theory of OSM (Di Lollo et al., 2000, but see Põder, 2013) explains this by a reentrant model (a variety of model i) according to which target-activated units at level H activated by the target send reentrant signals back to level L in order to test whether levels H and L are consistent in representing the target. If mismatch is registered (e.g., when target signals do not arrive anymore and mask signals arrive instead), the iterative feedforward-reentrant cycles are interrupted and new iterative “hypothesis testing” begins for the new object—the mask. Because cycles of reentrance are necessary for registration of the stimulus in awareness, the target is not consciously perceived when reentrant testing is prematurely interrupted by the stronger top–down mask signal. However, when mask’s offset is synchronous with that of the target, the target-plus-mask is a composite object that provides both level L and H contents; hence, the target can be extracted from the composite representation that is maintained through the feedword-reentrant cycles. Let us see how the model (ii) works for OSM. Presentation of target evokes specific signaling along L-H vertical axis and also a collaterally ignited boost of NSP modulation. (NSP is necessary for awareness of the specific contents represented by L and H.) When asynchroneous-offset mask remains in view and target signals do not arrive anymore, the top–down activation G that was initiated fast at higher levels, but takes time to become active at lower levels “finds” mask related activity in L, but the target related activity has decayed already realtive to the mask activity, because the target was switched off earlier. Although the level G activity is non-specific, when its downpropagating generic influence reaches L it helps emphasize mask features because level L units themselves are specific. The mask-object representation becomes consciously perceived instead of target. Thus, models (i) and (ii) both are usable. At this point one may ask why not follow Ockham’s rule and take the simpler one (i), i.e., the one with fewer hypotheses? However, the G units are important because neurobiological evidence has overwhelmingly shown that NSP is necessary for awareness of the specific contents represented by L and H.
  2. In Lamme et al. (2000) monkeys were trained to discriminate visual targets. V1 responses began to differentiate the “seen” from the “unseen” trials after 125 ms. In subsequent studies occipital ERPs in humans differentiated visibility of masked targets after 109–141 ms or peaked at about 160 ms (Fahrenfort et al., 2007, 2008). Again, a variety of model (i) was used for explaining the results because specifically the temporally late target related activity at level L (which followed earlier time epochs sufficient for level H to have become active in target processing) were associated with correct discrimination. And again, model (ii) can explain these empirical results: the late part of neural activity at L which is enhanced in trials where target is successfully discriminated may be modulated by the top–down process G passed down through levels H (or even bypassing stimulus-specific level H units either via direct fibers or level H units different from the stimulus-related ones).
  3. Temporal precedence of high-level MEG activity which discriminated correct and incorrect target processing over low level activity in the study by Bar et al. (2006) was also interpreted as a variety of model (i). However, if activity of G at frontal sites fluctuates (fluctuation of the thalamocortical NSP activity is a norm rather than an exception) and dictates whether the top–down modulation is stronger or weaker, these experimental results can be interpreted also according to model (ii).
  4. Ro et al. (2003) utilized transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) in a metacontrast masking paradigm and showed that TMS of visual cortex, when timed to produce visual suppression of an annulus (a metacontrast mask), induced recovery of a target disc which was imperceptible when TMS was not used. Moreover, TMS suppression of an annulus was more pronounced when a disk preceded it than when an annulus was presented alone. The authors assume that when the later activity, supposedly reflecting the reentrant effects is suppressed then target perceptibility can be reinstated. They argue that a prior visual stimulus can influence subsequent perception at early stages of visual encoding via feedback projections, supporting model (i). Alternatively, model (ii) can also be applied. It is known that a preceding brief stimulus (e.g., target) speeds up perception of the following stimulus (e.g., mask) (Bachmann, 1989; Scharlau, 2007). When target disc was presented before mask it may have speeded up masking annulus processing by presetting NSP modulation for its signals. This in turn may have optimized the effective processing delay so as to coincide with the maximal TMS effect.
  5. Up to now, both models appear to be equally applicable, but model (ii) provides an explanation of the results of an elegant experiment carried out by Wu et al. (2009) that model (i) cannot as readily provide. Capitalizing on the motion-induced blindness (MIB) phenomenon (Bonneh et al., 2001), where a static visual target-object continuously presented on a rotating background periodically disappears from awareness, they showed that a flashed stimulus that caused reappearance in awareness of the target was perceived after the reappearance of the target in consciousness. (The temporal value of reversal was about 100 ms, which is the value assumed to characterize the full cycle of reentrance based visual processing for awareness.) The temporal advantage of updating the conscious representation from the preexisting unconscious representation of the invisible static target was explained by a version of model (i), invoking reentry of neural signals after the first feed-forward sweep for a stimulus to be consciously perceived. Thus, MIB, by blocking reentry signals, prevents awareness. In Bachmann and Aru (2009) we pointed out some inconsistencies of this explanation and offered an explanation in terms of model (ii). When an object fades from awareness by MIB, its L and H level activity will be sustained because cortical specific signals are constantly present, but now it is dissociated from NSP-activity. When the flashed object is presented, the L/H process for representation of the flash occurs in parallel with a boost of the NSP-process igniting G. G leads to binding of the already present pre-conscious L/H-activity of the target with global consciousness-level representation. This process takes little time, because there is no need for build-up of the content-specific L/H representation of the target; consequently, its rapid reappearance in consciousness. The flashed object appears in consciousness not as fast, because its corresponding coherent L/H-representation must be built up, which takes time. The G that services targetawareness has L/H content of the target ready on the “waiting list” but the G process has to wait as a “dummy process” until the L/H contents of the flashed object are ready to be modulated.
It appears that experiments have difficulty in distinguishing between the two models. This raises the question whether a computational/mathematical argument could be developed that allows to test different predictions about experimental data on the basis of the two models. Sadly, space does not allow me to dwell into this important perspective which must be dealt with in future research.
Conclusion
In this opinion paper I argued for the view that in the majority of the standard experimental studies set to support the model of top–down processing featuring exclusively the specific system components also the combined non-specific/specific model seems equally valid.},

How do RAPs generate spurious motion signals, and what critical difference between RAPs and natural static scenes prevents the latter from appearing to move? Small involuntary eye movements during fixation have been suspected to play a critical role in these illusions, but here we give an account that does not depend on fixation jitter. We propose that these illusions result primarily from fast and slow changes over time in the neuronal representation of contrast (”contrast-driven RAPs”) or luminance (”luminance-driven RAPs”). We show that temporal phase advance in the neural response at high contrast can account for the early, fast motion in contrast-driven RAPs (such as “Rotating Snakes”) after each fixation change. An essential part of this explanation is that motion detectors fail to compensate for the dynamics of neuronal encoding. We argue that static natural patterns also generate local gain changes, but that these signals do not often trigger illusory motion because they are notusually aligned to drive global motion detectors. Movies in which real luminance changes over time, to mimic the proposed neuronal adaptations to contrast and luminance, evoke qualitatively similar percepts of motion. Experimental data are consistent with the explanation. Color and overall contrast both enhance the illusion.},

When concurrently presented auditory and visual stimuli are paired by chance, cue-induced preparatory neural activity is strongly enhanced in the task-relevant sensory system and suppressed in the irrelevant system. Conversely, when information in the two modalities is reliably associated, activity is enhanced in both systems regardless of which modality is task relevant. Our findings illustrate an ecologically optimal flexibility of the neural mechanisms that govern multisensory processing: facilitation occurs when integration is expected, and suppression occurs when distraction is expected. Because thalamic structures were more active when the senses needed to operate separately, we propose them to serve gatekeeper functions in early cross-modal interactions.},

abstract = {Direction-selective neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) and the extrastriate motion area MT/V5 constitute a critical channel that links early cortical mechanisms of spatiotemporal integration to downstream signals that underlie motion perception. We studied how temporal integration in direction-selective cells depends on speed, spatial frequency (SF), and contrast using randomly moving sinusoidal gratings and spike-triggered average (STA) analysis. The window of temporal integration revealed by the STAs varied substantially with stimulus parameters, extending farther back in time for slow motion, high SF, and low contrast. At low speeds and high SF, STA peaks were larger, indicating that a single spike often conveyed more information about the stimulus under conditions in which the mean firing rate was very low. The observed trends were similar in V1 and MT and offer a physiological correlate for a large body of psychophysical data on temporal integration. We applied the same visual stimuli to a model of motion detection based on oriented linear filters (a motion energy model) that incorporated an integrate-and-fire mechanism and found that it did not account for the neuronal data. Our results show that cortical motion processing in V1 and in MT is highly nonlinear and stimulus dependent. They cast considerable doubt on the ability of simple oriented filter models to account for the output of direction-selective neurons in a general manner. Finally, they suggest that spike rate tuning functions may miss important aspects of the neural coding of motion for stimulus conditions that evoke low firing rates.},

Stimuli were tailored to the preferences of cells recorded in the lateral geniculate nucleus (magnocellular and parvocellular), primary visual cortex (simple and complex), and the extrastriate motion area MT. We found that cells took longer to turn on (to increase their firing rate) than to turn off (to reduce their rate). The latency difference (onset minus offset) varied from several to tens of milliseconds across cell type and stimulus class and was correlated with spontaneous or driven firing rates for most cell classes. The delay for response onset depended on the nature of the stimulus present before the preferred stimulus appeared, and may result from persistent inhibition caused by antipreferred stimuli or from suppression that followed the offset of the preferred stimulus. The onset delay showed three distinct types of dependence on the temporal sequence of stimuli across classes of cells, implying that suppression may accumulate or wear off with time. Onset latency is generally longer, can be more variable, and has marked stimulus dependence compared with offset latency. This suggests an important role for offset latency in assessing the speed of information transmission in the visual system and raises the possibility that signal offsets provide a timing reference for visual processing. We discuss the origin of the delay in onset latency compared with offset latency and consider how it may limit the utility of certain feedforward circuits},

abstract = {Iso-orientation surround suppression is a powerful form of visual contextual modulation in which a stimulus of the preferred orientation of a neuron placed outside the classical receptive field (CRF) of the neuron suppresses the response to stimuli within the CRF. This suppression is most often attributed to orientation-tuned signals that propagate laterally across the cortex, activating local inhibition. By studying the temporal properties of surround suppression, we have uncovered characteristics that challenge standard notions of surround suppression. We found that the latency of suppression depended on its strength. Across cells, strong suppression arrived on average 30 msec earlier than weak suppression, and suppression sometimes arrived faster than the excitatory CRF response. We compared the relative latency of CRF response onset and offset with the relative latency of suppression onset and offset. Response onset was delayed relative to response offset in the CRF but not in the surround. This is not the expected result if neurons targeted by suppression are like those that generate it. We examined the time course of suppression as a function of distance of the surround stimulus from the CRF and found that suppression was predominantly sustained for nearby stimuli and predominantly transient for distant stimuli. By comparing the latency of suppression for nearby and distant stimuli, we found that orientation-tuned suppression could effectively propagate across 6 - 8 mm of cortex at [~]1 m/sec. This is considerably faster than expected for horizontal cortical connections previously implicated in surround suppression. We offer refinements to circuits for surround suppression that account for these results and describe how feedback from cells with large CRFs can account for the rapid propagation of suppression within V1},

abstract = {We studied the simultaneous activity of pairs of neurons recorded with a single electrode in visual cortical area MT while monkeys performed a direction discrimination task. Previously, we reported the strength of interneuronal correlation of spike count on the time scale of the behavioral epoch (2 sec) and noted its potential impact on signal pooling (Zohary et al., 1994). We have now examined correlation at longer and shorter time scales and found that pair-wise cross-correlation was predominantly short term (10-100 msec). Narrow, central peaks in the spike train cross-correlograms were largely responsible for correlated spike counts on the time scale of the behavioral epoch. Longer-term (many seconds to minutes) changes in the responsiveness of single neurons were observed in auto-correlations; however, these slow changes in time were on average uncorrelated between neurons. Knowledge of the limited time scale of correlation allowed the derivation of a more efficient metric for spike count correlation based on spike timing information, and it also revealed a potential relative advantage of larger neuronal pools for shorter integration times. Finally, correlation did not depend on the presence of the visual stimulus or the behavioral choice of the animal. It varied little with stimulus condition but was stronger between neurons with similar direction tuning curves. Taken together, our results strengthen the view that common input, common stimulus selectivity, and common noise are tightly linked in functioning cortical circuits Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

abstract = {It is often of interest experimentally to assess how synchronization between two neurons changes following a stimulus or other behaviorally relevant marker. The joint peristimulus time histogram (JPSTH) achieves this, but assumes that changes in the cells’ firing rate following the stimulus are stereotyped from one sweep to the next. Erroneous results can be generated if this is not the case. We here present a method to assess whether there are variations in response latency or amplitude from sweep to sweep. We then describe how the effects of response latency variation can be mitigated by realigning sweeps to their individual latencies. Three methods of detecting response latency are presented and their performance compared on simulated data. Finally, the effect on the JPSTH of sweep realignment using detected latencies is illustrated Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

We used the Collation of Connectivity Data on the Macaque Brain (CoCoMac) and calculated the degree distributions, transmission coefficients, connection density, clustering coefficients, path lengths, and modularity. Our results showed that the TCL and cortex exhibit exponential degree distributions, and the ratio of efferent/afferent connections in the thalamus is smaller than 1.0 This may support the notion that the connections received by the thalamus from the cortex play a key role in improving information processing in the conscious states. The average values of transmission coefficients for the cortex and TCL were found to be equal to 1.49 and 1.28, respectively. This indicates that: (i) the cortex is a system that mainly transmits information outward rather than receives it; (ii) the TCL is a cooperative system that performs this in a give-and-take manner; (iii) connections of the cortex are denser than those in the TCL, showing that the cortex might be advantageous for processing of complicated information during consciousness; (iv) both the TCL and cortex are small-world systems; (v) the scaled value of the characteristic path length in the TCL is smaller than that in the cortex, which implies a higher speed potential for information processing in the TCL than in the cortex; (vi) the scaled value of the clustering coefficient is nearly the same in the cortex and TCL, and (vii) the number of modules is 5 in the cortex and 6 in the TCL.},

abstract = {1. The cellular mechanisms by which neurons of the ferret perigeniculate nucleus (PGN) participate in the generation of spindle waves and slowed absence seizure-like oscillations were investigated with intracellular and extracellular recording techniques in geniculate slices maintained in vitro. 2. During spindle wave generation, PGN neurons generated repetitive (2-9 Hz) high frequency (up to 500 Hz) burst discharges mediated by the activation of a low threshold Ca2+ spike by the arrival of barrages of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs). In most PGN cells at resting membrane potentials (-60 to -70 mV) spindle waves were associated with a progressive hyperpolarization that persisted as a prolonged after-hyperpolarization. 3. The EPSPs occurring in PGN cells were highly synchronized with burst firing in the neighbouring portion of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) and were intermixed with short duration inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs). After block of GABAergic receptors, the EPSPs occurring during the generation of spindle waves reversed polarity at around 0 mV. In addition, these EPSPs were completely blocked with the bath application of the non-NMDA receptor antagonist 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione (CNQX), as was spindle wave generation in both the PGN and LGNd. 4. Slowing the intraspindle frequency to 2-4 Hz with pharmacological block of GABAA receptors resulted in a marked increase in the intensity of burst firing by PGN cells such that the number of action potentials per burst increased from a maximum of thirteen to a maximum of sixty. Block of GABAA receptors also resulted in a marked increase in the amplitude and duration of the EPSP barrages arriving from the relay laminae during generation of the slowed oscillation. 5. These findings indicate that spindle waves are generated in the ferret LGNd in vitro through an interaction between the GABAergic neurons of the PGN and relay neurons, such that burst firing in relay neurons activates a barrage of EPSPs and a subsequent low threshold Ca2+ spike in PGN cells. This activation of PGN neurons inhibits a substantial number of relay cells, a few of which rebound burst after this IPSP, thus starting the cycle again. Block of GABAA receptors results in a marked enhancement of activity in PGN cells through increased excitation from relay cells and disinhibition from neighbouring PGN cells. This increased activity in PGN neurons results in a markedly enhanced activation of GABAB receptors in relay neurons and the subsequent generation of paroxysmal activity that is similar to that associated with absence seizures.},

abstract = {1. The cellular basis for generation of spindle waves and a slower synchronized oscillation resembling absence seizures was investigated with extracellular and intracellular recording techniques in slices of ferret dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) maintained in vitro. 2. Intracellular recording from LGNd relay cells in vitro revealed that spindle waves occurred once every 3-30 s and were associated with barrages of inhibitory postsynaptic potentials (IPSPs) occurring at a frequency of 6-10 Hz. These IPSPs resulted in the generation of rebound low threshold Ca2+ spikes at 2-4 Hz, owing to the intrinsic propensity of LGNd relay cells to generate oscillatory burst firing in this frequency range. These rebound bursts of action potentials were highly synchronized with local multiunit and single unit activity. 3. The spindle wave-associated IPSPs in LGNd relay cells exhibited a mean reversal potential of -86 mV. This reversal potential was shifted to more depolarized membrane potentials with the intracellular injection of Cl- through the use of KCl-filled microelectrodes. Simultaneous recording from the perigeniculate nucleus (PGN) and LGNd revealed the IPSPs to be synchronous with the occurrence of burst firing in the PGN. Excitation of PGN neurons with local electrical stimulation after pharmacological block of excitatory amino acid transmission resulted in bicuculline-sensitive IPSPs in relay neurons similar in amplitude and time course to those occurring during spindle waves. 4. Application of (-)-bicuculline methiodide resulted in the abolition of spindle wave-associated IPSPs or in the slowing of the rate of rise, an increase in amplitude and a prolongation of these IPSPs; this resulted in a synchronized 2-4 Hz oscillation, in which each relay cell strongly burst on nearly every cycle, thus forming a paroxysmal event. Bath application of the GABAB receptor antagonist 2-OH-saclofen blocked these slowed oscillations, indicating that they are mediated by the activation of GABAB receptors. In contrast, pharmacological antagonism of GABAB receptors did not block the generation of normal spindle waves. 5. These and other results indicate that spindle waves are generated in the ferret LGNd in vitro as a network phenomenon occurring through an interaction between the relay cells of the LGNd and the GABAergic neurons of the PGN. We propose that burst firing in PGN cells hyperpolarizes relay neurons through activation of GABAA receptors. These IPSPs result in rebound burst firing in LGNd cells, which then excite PGN neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Primary visual cortex (V1) is clearly distinguishable from other cortical areas by its distinctive pattern of neocortical lamination across mammalian species. In some mammals, primates in particular, the layers of V1 are further divided into a number of sublayers based on their anatomical and functional characteristics. While these sublayers are easily recognizable across a range of primates, the exact number of divisions in each layer and their relative position within the depth of V1 has been inconsistently reported, largely due to conflicting schemes of nomenclature for the V1 layers. This conflict centers on the definition of layer 4 in primate V1, and the subdivisions of layer 4 that can be consistently identified across primate species. Brodmann’s (1909) laminar scheme for V1 delineates three subdivisions of layer 4 in primates, based on cellular morphology and geniculate inputs in anthropoid monkeys. In contrast, Hässler’s (1967) laminar scheme delineates a single layer 4 and multiple subdivisions of layer 3, based on comparisons of V1 lamination across the primate lineage. In order to clarify laminar divisions in primate visual cortex, we performed NeuN and VGLUT2 immunohistochemistry in V1 of chimpanzees, Old World macaque monkeys, New World squirrel, owl, and marmoset monkeys, prosimian galagos and mouse lemurs, and non-primate, but highly visual, tree shrews. By comparing the laminar divisions identified by each method across species, we find that Hässler’s (1967) laminar scheme for V1 provides a more consistent representation of neocortical layers across all primates, including humans, and facilitates comparisons of V1 lamination with non-primate species. These findings, along with many others, support the consistent use of Hässler’s laminar scheme in V1 research.},

abstract = {The chemoanatomical organization of the visual sector of the cat’s thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN)-that is at the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and at the pulvinar nucleus (Pul)-was investigated with two novel cytoarchitectonic markers. The Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA) binding reaction visualized the extracellular perineuronal net (PN) and the SMI 32 immunoreaction stained intracellular neurofilaments. Two distinct layers of the TRN could be detected, particularly by WFA- but also by SMI 32-staining. The outer tier outlined a canopy of labeling placed a bit detached from the diencephalon dorsolaterally, while the inner TRN tier is very tightly attached to the thalamic lamina limitans externa. The labeled neurons showed typically fusiform morphology with dendrites orienting in the plane of TRN. Additionally, these chemoarchitectural reactions identified a chain of structures in the ventral diencephalon connected to the TRN tiers. One stained string is formed by the subthalamic nucleus bound laterally to the peripeduncular nucleus extending further dorsolateral into the outer TRN tier. The other chain laced up the field of Forel, the zona incerta, the ventral LGN, the perigeniculate nucleus (PGN) and the previously-overlooked peripulvinar nucleus (PPulN) and so formed the inner TRN tier. In the third most distanced TRN tier, in the perireticular nucleus, a very few WFA-binding presenting neuron were found. In addition to the PN possessing TRN neurons, WFA-reactive presumable interneurons were also labeled within the visual thalamus. Following tracer injections into the feline Pul, two stripes of cells were retrogradely labeled in the neighboring visual TRN sector. The location of these reticular neurons coincided precisely with the chemoanatomically identified inner and outer TRN tiers. On the analogy of the PGN-TRN duality at the dLGN, the chemoanatomical and tract tracing findings strongly suggest a similar dual organization in the pulvinoprojecting TRN portion.},

High-speed video of behaving mice revealed whisker velocities of at least 17,000°/s, so we delivered an ultrafast “ping” (>50,000°/s) to single whiskers and sampled primary afferent activity at 500 kHz. Median spike jitter was 17.4 μs; 29% of neurons had spike jitter < 10 μs. These results indicate that the input stage of the trigeminal pathway has extraordinary spike-timing precision and very high potential information capacity. This timing precision ranks among the highest in biology.},

This concept has been crystallized as “labeled lines,” to denote that axons communicate the specific properties of their sensory or motor parent cell. Such cells also can be characterized as being polarized, that is, as representing a signed quantity that is either positive or negative. We show in a model simulation that there are two important consequences when learning receptive fields using such signed codings in circuits that subtract different inputs. The first is that, in feedback circuits using labeled lines, such arithmetic operations need to be distributed across multiple distinct pathways. The second consequence is that such pathways must be necessarily dynamic, i.e., that synapses can grow and retract when forming receptive fields. The model monitors the breaking and growing of new circuit connections when their synapses need to change polarities and predicts that the rate of such changes should be inversely correlated with the progress of receptive field formation.},

abstract = {Spike trains and local field potentials (LFPs) resulting from extracellular current flows provide a substrate for neural information processing. Understanding the neural code from simultaneous spike-field recordings and subsequent decoding of information processing events will have widespread applications. One way to demonstrate an understanding of the neural code, with particular advantages for the development of applications, is to formulate a parametric statistical model of neural activity and its covariates. Here, we propose a set of parametric spike-field models (unified models) that can be used with existing decoding algorithms to reveal the timing of task or stimulus specific processing. Our proposed unified modeling framework captures the effects of two important features of information processing: time-varying stimulus-driven inputs and ongoing background activity that occurs even in the absence of environmental inputs. We have applied this framework for decoding neural latencies in simulated and experimentally recorded spike-field sessions obtained from the lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of awake, behaving monkeys performing cued look-and-reach movements to spatial targets. Using both simulated and experimental data, we find that estimates of trial-by-trial parameters are not significantly affected by the presence of ongoing background activity. However, including background activity in the unified model improves goodness of fit for predicting individual spiking events. Uncovering the relationship between the model parameters and the timing of movements offers new ways to test hypotheses about the relationship between neural activity and behavior. We obtained significant spike-field onset time correlations from single trials using a previously published data set where significantly strong correlation was only obtained through trial averaging. We also found that unified models extracted a stronger relationship between neural response latency and trial-by-trial behavioral performance than existing models of neural information processing. Our results highlight the utility of the unified modeling framework for characterizing spike-LFP recordings obtained during behavioral performance.},

abstract = {Simple cells in layer 4 of the primary visual cortex of the cat show contrast-invariant orientation tuning, in which the amplitude of the peak response is proportional to the stimulus contrast but the width of the tuning curve hardly changes with contrast. This study uses a detailed model of spiny stellate cells (SSCs) from cat area 17 to explain this property. The model integrates our experimental data, including morphological and intrinsic membrane properties and the number and spatial distribution of four major synaptic input sources of the SSC: the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and three cortical sources. The model also includes synaptic properties of these inputs. The cortical input served as sources of background activity, and visual stimuli was modeled as sinusoidal grating. For all contrasts, strong synaptic depression of the dLGN feedforward afferents compresses the firing rates in response to orthogonal stimuli, keeping these rates at practically the same low level. However, at preferred orientations, despite synaptic depression, firing rate changes as a function of contrast. Thus, when embedded in an active network, strong synaptic depression can explain contrast-invariant orientation tuning of simple cells. This is true also when the dLGN inputs are partially depressed as a result of their spontaneous activity and to some extent also when parameters were fitted to a more moderate level of synaptic depression. The model response is in close agreement with experimental results, in terms of both output spikes and membrane voltage (amplitude and fluctuations), with reasonable exceptions given that recurrent connections were not incorporated.},

abstract = {To investigate the properties of excitatory connections between layer 4 pyramidal cells and whether these differed between rat and cat, paired intracellular recordings were made with biocytin filling in slices of adult neocortex. These connections were also compared with those from layer 4 spiny cells to layer 3 pyramids and connections between layer 3 pyramids. Connectivity ratios for layer 4 pyramid-pyramid pairs (1:14 cat, 1:18 rat) appeared lower than for the other types of connections studied in parallel, but excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitudes and time course were not significantly different either between species or across types of connection. Layer 4 pyramids targeted postsynaptic basal dendrites in both species, whether the pyramidal target was in layer 4 or layer 3. Within layer 4, relationships between mean EPSP amplitude, numbers of putative contacts, and distance between connected pairs indicated a rapid decline in connectivity strength with distance, equivalent to 3.4 mV and 10 synapses per 100 microm separation, from a maximum of 4 mV and 10 synapses at 0 microm. However, a subset, of burst-firing layer 4 pyramids, appeared to make no connections with other layer 4 spiny cells. Second EPSPs were depressed by 36% in rat and 28% in cat relative to first EPSPs at interspike intervals <15 ms. Subsequent EPSPs in brief trains were further depressed. Depression was predominantly presynaptic in origin. Recovery from depression could not be described adequately by a simple exponential for individual connections; it included peaks and troughs with periodicities of 10-15 ms. Complex relationships between the first 2 interspike intervals and third EPSP amplitude were also apparent in all connections so studied. Large third EPSPs followed specific combinations of first and second interspike intervals so that increasing, or decreasing, one without changing the other resulted in a smaller third EPSP. Finally, the outputs of layer 4 spiny cells to layer 3 exhibited partial recovery from depression during longer high-frequency trains, a property not apparent in the other connections studied.},

Recent proposals gradually promote the role of top-down processing in recognition, but how such facilitation is triggered remains a puzzle. We tested a specific model, proposing that low spatial frequencies facilitate visual object recognition by initiating top-down processes projected from orbitofrontal to visual cortex. The present study combined magnetoencephalography, which has superior temporal resolution, functional magnetic resonance imaging, and a behavioral task that yields successful recognition with stimulus repetitions. Object recognition elicited differential activity that developed in the left orbitofrontal cortex 50 ms earlier than it did in recognition-related areas in the temporal cortex. This early orbitofrontal activity was directly modulated by the presence of low spatial frequencies in the image. Taken together, the dynamics we revealed provide strong support for the proposal of how top-down facilitation of object recognition is initiated, and our observations are used to derive predictions for future research.},

abstract = {Psychophysical techniques typically assume straightforward relationships between manipulations of real-world events, their effects on the brain, and behavioral reports of those effects. However, these relationships can be influenced by many complex, strategic factors that contribute to task performance. Here we discuss several of these factors that share two key features. First, they involve subjects making flexible use of time to process information. Second, this flexibility can reflect the rational regulation of information-processing trade-offs that can play prominent roles in particular temporal epochs: sensitivity to stability versus change for past information, speed versus accuracy for current information, and exploitation versus exploration for future goals. Understanding how subjects manage these trade-offs can be used to help design and interpret psychophysical studies.},

abstract = {To better understand face recognition, it is necessary to identify not only which brain structures are implicated but also the dynamics of the neuronal activity in these structures. Latencies can then be compared to unravel the temporal dynamics of information processing at the distributed network level. To achieve high spatial and temporal resolution, we used intracerebral recordings in epileptic subjects while they performed a famous/unfamiliar face recognition task. The first components peaked at 110 ms in the fusiform gyrus (FG) and simultaneously in the inferior frontal gyrus, suggesting the early establishment of a large-scale network. This was followed by components peaking at 160 ms in 2 areas along the FG. Important stages of distributed parallel processes ensued at 240 and 360 ms involving up to 6 regions along the ventral visual pathway. The final components peaked at 480 ms in the hippocampus. These stages largely overlapped. Importantly, event-related potentials to famous faces differed from unfamiliar faces and control stimuli in all medial temporal lobe structures. The network was bilateral but more right sided. Thus, recognition of famous faces takes place through the establishment of a complex set of local and distributed processes that interact dynamically and may be an emergent property of these interactions.},

This paper gives evidence about mechanisms analysing sensory redundancy in biological vision. Automatic gain controls for luminance and contrast depend upon feedback from the input, and there are strong indications that the autocorrelation function, and other associations between input variables, affect the contrast sensitivity function and our subjective experience of the world. The associative structure of sensory message can provide much knowledge about the world we live in, and neural mechanisms that discount established associative structure in the input messages by recoding them can improve survival by making new structure more easily detectable. These mechanisms may be responsible for illusions, such as those produced by a concave face-mask, that are classically attributed to top-down influences},

This paper argues that the original hypothesis was wrong in over-emphasizing the role of compressive coding and economy in neuron numbers, but right in drawing attention to the importance of redundancy. Furthermore there is a clear direction in which it now points, namely to the overwhelming importance of probabilities and statistics in neuroscience. The brain has to decide upon actions in a competitive, chance-driven world, and to do this well it must know about and exploit the non-random probabilities and interdependences of objects and events signalled by sensory messages. These are particularly relevant for Bayesian calculations of the optimum course of action. Instead of thinking of neural representations as transformations of stimulus energies, we should regard them as approximate estimates of the probable truths of hypotheses about the current environment, for these are the quantities required by a probabilistic brain working on Bayesian principles.},

This has been recognised by many of those interested in cognitive function, starting with Helmholtz, Mach, and Pearson, and continuing through Craik, Tolman, Attneave, and Brunswik. In the current era, many of us have begun to show how neural mechanisms exploit the regular statistical properties of natural images. Shepard proposed that the apparent trajectory of an object when seen successively at two positions results from internalising the rules of kinematic geometry, and although kinematic geometry is not statistical in nature, this is clearly a related idea. Here it is argued that Shepard’s term, “internalisation,” is insufficient because it is also necessary to derive an advantage from the process. Having mechanisms selectively sensitive to the spatio-temporal patterns of excitation commonly experienced when viewing moving objects would facilitate the detection, interpolation, and extrapolation of such motions, and might explain the twisting motions that are experienced. Although Shepard’s explanation in terms of Chasles’ rule seems doubtful, his theory and experiments illustrate that local twisting motions are needed for the analysis of moving objects and provoke thoughts about how they might be detected.},

abstract = {1. Responses of cat retinal ganglion cells have been examined with a view to specifying the characteristics that limit the detection of light stimuli.2. Threshold is defined as the weakest stimulus that can be reliably detected by examination of the output from a retinal ganglion cell; it depends upon (a) the quantum/spike ratio, which is the mean number of additional quantal absorptions required to produce an additional impulse, (b) the temporal course of the response, which determines the time interval within which the maintained discharge is modified, and (c) the statistical distribution of the number of impulses that occur in this time interval in the absence of the stimulus.3. The quantum/spike ratio changes greatly when adapting luminance is changed, and this is the predominant factor accounting for changes in increment threshold.4. The time course of the response changes with adaptation level and area of the stimulus. This may account for the changes in temporal integration that occur in analogous psychophysical experiments.5. Changes in the irregularity of the maintained discharge also affect the threshold of single ganglion cells. This is only a minor factor in the conditions of most of our experiments, but it may be important when unstabilized images and non-equilibrium adaptation conditions are encountered.},

Hence when an image moves, high spatial frequency components are lost if their direction of modulation coincides with the direction of movement, but not if it is orthogonal. The power spectra of natural images are remarkably consistent in having a 1/f 2 falloff in power in all directions. For moving images, the spatial power spectra will be distorted by becoming steeper in the direction corresponding to modulation in the direction of motion, and the contours of equal power will tend to become elliptical. This study demonstrates that the mammalian visual system is specifically sensitive to such anisotropic changes of the local power spectrum, and it is suggested that these distortions are used to determine patterns of optic flow. Convergent evidence from work on Glass figures, motion streaks, and sensitivity to non-Cartesian gratings is called on in support of this interpretation, which has been foreshadowed in several recent publications.},

Action potentials were recorded from optic nerve fibres of lightly anaesthetized cats while parts of the retina remote from the receptive field were stimulated by a shifting grating. 2. Vigorous responses can be obtained under these conditions, confirming McIlwain (1966), Krüger & Fischer (1973), and others. 3. These ‘shift responses’ are not caused by fluctuations of stray light because (a) they cannot be reduced by deliberately increasing or decreasing the light falling on the receptive field synchronously with the shifting grating; (b) a steady adapting light applied to the receptive field does not raise the threshold for the responses, whereas adapting light on the peripheral retina does, and (c) the threshold for the responses is elevated more following bleaching adaptation of the periphery than following bleaching adaptation of the centre. 4. Shift responses are strong, of short latency, and brief in duration in brisk-transient (Y-type) neurones. With few exceptions they are weak but long-lasting in brisk-sustained (X-type) neurones. 5. Shift responses are unlike responses from the main receptive field in having a distinct threshold; the magnitude of the response to weak gratings is not simply proportional to contrast, as is the case with weak stimuli applied to the receptive field. 6. It is thought that the excitatory pathway may involve amacrine cells, and that this mechanism may be concerned with the detection of the shifts of the image that occur with saccadic eye movements.},

abstract = {Freezing is an effective defense strategy for some prey, because their predators rely on visual motion to distinguish objects from their surroundings. An object moving over a background progressively covers (deletes) and uncovers (accretes) background texture while simultaneously producing discontinuities in the optic flow field. These events unambiguously specify kinetic occlusion and can produce a crisp edge, depth perception, and figure-ground segmentation between identically textured surfaces--percepts which all disappear without motion. Given two abutting regions of uniform random texture with different motion velocities, one region appears to be situated farther away and behind the other (i.e., the ground) if its texture is accreted or deleted at the boundary between the regions, irrespective of region and boundary velocities. Consequently, a region with moving texture appears farther away than a stationary region if the boundary is stationary, but it appears closer (i.e., the figure) if the boundary is moving coherently with the moving texture. A computational model of visual areas V1 and V2 shows how interactions between orientation- and direction-selective cells first create a motion-defined boundary and then signal kinetic occlusion at that boundary. Activation of model occlusion detectors tuned to a particular velocity results in the model assigning the adjacent surface with a matching velocity to the far depth. A weak speed-depth bias brings faster-moving texture regions forward in depth in the absence of occlusion (shearing motion). These processes together reproduce human psychophysical reports of depth ordering for key cases of kinetic occlusion displays.},

Two decades later, the first commercially available devices have the capability to allow users to identify basic shapes. Such devices are still very far from returning vision beyond the legal blindness. Thus, there is considerable continued development of electrode materials, and structures and electronic control mechanisms to increase both resolution and contrast. In parallel, the field of optogenetics—the genetic photosensitization of neural tissue holds particular promise for new approaches. Given that the eye is transparent, photosensitizing remaining neural layers of the eye and illuminating from the outside could prove to be less invasive, cheaper, and more effective than present approaches. As we move toward human trials in the coming years, this review explores the core technological and biological challenges related to the gene therapy and the high radiance optical stimulation requirement.},

abstract = {In binocular rivalry, the conscious percept alternates stochastically between two images shown to the two eyes. Both suppressed and dominant images form afterimages (AIs) whose strength depends on the perceptual state during induction. Counterintuitively, when these two AIs rival, the AI of the previously suppressed percept gains initial dominance, even when it is weaker. Here, we examined rivalry between afterimages, between real images, and between both to examine eye-based and binocular contributions to this effect. In all experiments, we found that for both AIs and real images, the suppressed percept consistently gained initial dominance following a long suppression period. Dominance reversals failed to occur following short suppression periods and depended on an abrupt change (removal) of the stimulus. With real images, results were replicated also when eye channels were exchanged during the abrupt change. The initial dominance of the weaker, previously suppressed percept is thus not due to its weaker contrast, to it being an afterimage, or to monocular adaptation effects as previously suggested. Instead, it is due to binocular, higher level effects that favor a perceptual switch after prolonged dominance. We discuss a plausible neural account for these findings in terms of neural interactions between binocular and eye-related stages.},

Here we investigate the possibility that such response variability might in fact be beneficial, because it may partially compensate for a decrease in accuracy due to stochastic changes in the synaptic strengths of a network. We study the interplay between two kinds of noise, response (or neuronal) noise and synaptic noise, by analyzing their joint influence on the accuracy of neural networks trained to perform various tasks. We find an interesting, generic interaction: when fluctuations in the synaptic connections are proportional to their strengths (multiplicative noise), a certain amount of response noise in the input neurons can significantly improve network performance, compared to the same network without response noise. Performance is enhanced because response noise and multiplicative synaptic noise are in some ways equivalent. So if the algorithm used to find the optimal synaptic weights can take into account the variability of the model neurons, it can also take into account the variability of the synapses. Thus, the connection patterns generated with response noise are typically more resistant to synaptic degradation than those obtained without response noise. As a consequence of this interplay, if multiplicative synaptic noise is present, it is better to have response noise in the network than not to have it. These results are demonstrated analytically for the most basic network consisting of two input neurons and one output neuron performing a simple classification task, but computer simulations show that the phenomenon persists in a wide range of architectures, including recurrent (attractor) networks and sensorimotor networks that perform coordinate transformations. The results suggest that response variability could play an important dynamic role in networks that continuously learn.},

Specifically, we conciliate quantitative studies of microcircuitry and the functional logic of neuronal computations. We revisit the established idea that message passing among hierarchical cortical areas implements a form of Bayesian inference-paying careful attention to the implications for intrinsic connections among neuronal populations. By deriving canonical forms for these computations, one can associate specific neuronal populations with specific computational roles. This analysis discloses a remarkable correspondence between the microcircuitry of the cortical column and the connectivity implied by predictive coding. Furthermore, it provides some intuitive insights into the functional asymmetries between feedforward and feedback connections and the characteristic frequencies over which they operate.},

In the visual system, oscillations in the gamma-frequency range (30-100 Hz) are thought to subserve corticocortical communication. To test whether a similar mechanism might influence subcortical-cortical communication, we recorded local field potential activity from retinotopically aligned regions in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) of alert macaque monkeys viewing stimuli known to produce strong cortical gamma-band oscillations. As predicted, we found robust gamma-band power in V1. In contrast, visual stimulation did not evoke gamma-band activity in the LGN. Interestingly, an analysis of oscillatory phase synchronization of LGN and V1 activity identified synchronization in the alpha (8-14 Hz) and beta (15-30 Hz) frequency bands. Further analysis of directed connectivity revealed that alpha-band interactions mediated corticogeniculate feedback processing, whereas beta-band interactions mediated geniculocortical feedforward processing. These results demonstrate that although the LGN and V1 display functional interactions in the lower frequency bands, gamma-band activity in the alert monkey is largely an emergent property of cortex.},

abstract = {Synaptic noise is thought to be a limiting factor for computational efficiency in the brain. In visual cortex (V1), ongoing activity is present in vivo, and spiking responses to simple stimuli are highly unreliable across trials. Stimulus statistics used to plot receptive fields, however, are quite different from those experienced during natural visuomotor exploration. We recorded V1 neurons intracellularly in the anaesthetized and paralyzed cat and compared their spiking and synaptic responses to full field natural images animated by simulated eye-movements to those evoked by simpler (grating) or higher dimensionality statistics (dense noise). In most cells, natural scene animation was the only condition where high temporal precision (in the 10-20 ms range) was maintained during sparse and reliable activity. At the subthreshold level, irregular but highly reproducible membrane potential dynamics were observed, even during long (several 100 ms) “spike-less” periods. We showed that both the spatial structure of natural scenes and the temporal dynamics of eye-movements increase the signal-to-noise ratio by a non-linear amplification of the signal combined with a reduction of the subthreshold contextual noise. These data support the view that the sparsening and the time precision of the neural code in V1 may depend primarily on three factors: (1) broadband input spectrum: the bandwidth must be rich enough for recruiting optimally the diversity of spatial and time constants during recurrent processing; (2) tight temporal interplay of excitation and inhibition: conductance measurements demonstrate that natural scene statistics narrow selectively the duration of the spiking opportunity window during which the balance between excitation and inhibition changes transiently and reversibly; (3) signal energy in the lower frequency band: a minimal level of power is needed below 10 Hz to reach consistently the spiking threshold, a situation rarely reached with visual dense noise.},

A computer simulation of an AL network was used to test the hypothesis that slow inhibitory connections between local neurons (LNs) and PNs are responsible for temporal patterning. Activation of slow inhibitory receptors on PNs by the same GABAergic synapses that underlie fast oscillatory synchronization of PNs was sufficient to shape slow response modulations. This slow stimulus- and neuron-specific patterning of AL activity was resistant to blockade of fast inhibition. Fast and slow inhibitory mechanisms at synapses between LNs and PNs can thus form dynamical PN assemblies whose elements synchronize transiently and oscillate collectively, as observed not only in the locust AL, but also in the vertebrate olfactory bulb.},

GABAergic interconnections between LNs led to competition among them such that different groups of LNs oscillated with periodic Ca(2+) spikes during different 50-250 ms temporal epochs, similar to those recorded in vivo. During these epochs, LN-evoked IPSPs caused phase-locked, population oscillations in sets of postsynaptic PNs.

Here we investigate how this activity affects the spatio- temporal properties of spindle oscillations with computer models of interacting RE and thalamocortical (TC) cells. In a one- dimensional network of RE and TC cells, sequences of spindle oscillations alternated with localized patterns of spike-burst activity propagating inside the RE network. New sequences of spindle oscillations were initiated after removal of I(h)- mediated depolarization of the TC cells. The length of the interspindle lulls depended on the intrinsic and synaptic properties of RE and TC cells and was in the range of 3-20 s. In a two-dimensional model, GABA(A)-mediated 2-3 Hz oscillations persisted in the RE nucleus during interspindle lulls and initiated spindle sequences at many foci within the RE-TC network simultaneously. This model predicts that the intrinsic properties of the reticular thalamus may contribute to the synchrony of spindle oscillations observed in vivo},

abstract = {Retinal ganglion cells fire spikes to an appropriate contrast presented over their receptive field center. These center responses undergo dynamic changes in sensitivity depending on the ongoing level of contrast, a process known as “contrast gain control.” Extracellular recordings suggested that gain control is driven by a single wide-field mechanism, extending across the center and beyond, that depends on inhibitory interneurons: amacrine cells. However, recordings in salamander suggested that the excitatory bipolar cells, which drive the center, may themselves show gain control independently of amacrine cell mechanisms. Here, we tested in mammalian ganglion cells whether amacrine cells are critical for gain control over the receptive field center. We made extracellular and whole-cell recordings of guinea pig Y-type cells in vitro and quantified the gain change between contrasts using a linear–nonlinear analysis. For spikes, tripling contrast reduced gain by 40%. With spikes blocked, ganglion cells showed similar levels of gain control in membrane currents and voltages and under conditions of low and high calcium buffering: tripling contrast reduced gain by 20–25%. Gain control persisted under voltage-clamp conditions that minimize inhibitory conductances and pharmacological conditions that block inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors. Gain control depended on adequate stimulation, not of ganglion cells but of presynaptic bipolar cells. Furthermore, horizontal cell measurements showed a lack of gain control in photoreceptor synaptic release. Thus, the mechanism for gain control over the ganglion cell receptive field center, as measured in the subthreshold response, originates in the presynaptic bipolar cells and does not require amacrine cell signaling.},

abstract = {Evidence that visual grouping is facilitated when elements comprising a foreground figure are presented simultaneously, and are temporally separated from elements comprising the background, has suggested cortical synchronous oscillations as a possible neural substrate. Supporting this theory, Usher and Donnelly (Nature 394 (1998) 179) showed in one of their experiments that contour integration is facilitated when path and background elements alternate with an asynchrony below the integration time of the visual system, suggesting that these flickering stimuli interact with this hypothetical binding mechanism. I replicated this experiment and report that the effect depends in fact on the order of asynchrony between path and background elements in the first cycle of stimuli presented for more than 100 ms: facilitation in visual grouping only occurs when path elements are presented before background elements. A second experiment, exploring the effect of onset delays between path and background elements, demonstrates a strong priming effect of path elements. I conclude that Usher and Donnelly’s result is likely due to the high sensitivity of the visual system to stimulus onset, and that simple flickering stimuli are inadequate for revealing the neural code for binding in figure-ground segregation without controlling for the effect of stimulus onset.

The task requires the linking of orientation across space to detect a contour in a stimulus composed of randomly oriented Gabor elements (1.5 cpd, sigma = 0.17 deg), measured using a temporal 2AFC method. A contour of ten elements was pasted into a 10 x 10 cells array, a ndbackground elements were randomly positioned within the available cells. The effect of element spacing was investigated by varying the mean interelement distance between two and six times the period of the Gabor elements (lambda = 0.66 deg) while the total number of elements was fixed. Contour detection was measured as a function of its curvature for jagged contours and for closed contours. At all curvatures, we found that performance for chromatic mechanisms declines more steeply with the increase in element separation than does performance for the achromatic mechanism. Averaged critical element separations were 4.6 +/- 0.7, 3.6 +/- 0.4, and 2.9 +/- 0.2 deg for Ach, BY, and RG mechanisms, respectively. These results suggest that contour integration by the chromatic mechanisms relies more on short-range interactions in comparison to the achromatic mechanism. In a further experiment, we looked at the combined effect of element size and element separation in contour integration for the Ach mechanism. We found that the critical separation decreases linearly with the spatial frequency, from about 5 deg at low spatial frequency (larger elements) to about 1 deg at high spatial frequency (smaller elements) suggesting a scale invariance in contour integration. In both experiments we also found no differences between closed and open jagged contours detection in terms of element separation.

Stimuli were spatiotemporal Gaussian patches of 2D orientation noise band-pass filtered in Fourier domain. Orientation acuity was measured for various combinations of stimulus spatial bandwidth, spatial frequency, and size as a function of orientation bandwidths of the stimuli. Stimulus contrast was matched in multiples of detection threshold. Consistent with the idea that stimulus orientation bandwidth acts as a source of external noise, orientation discrimination thresholds increased monotonically in all conditions with stimulus bandwidth. To interpret these results quantitatively, we first fitted a variance summation model to the data and derived the internal orientation noise, relative sampling efficiency, and orientation tuning of the mechanism underlying orientation discrimination. Due to the equivocal biological nature of these parameters for orientation discrimination, we investigated, with a modeling approach, how neural detectors characterized by a broad orientation tuning may support orientation discrimination. We demonstrated using the ideal-observer theory that while linear models, based on either unimodal filtering or center-surround opponency, predict the monotonic relationship between orientation discrimination threshold and orientation noise, a nonlinear model incorporating a broadband divisive inhibition in the orientation domain is a better candidate due to its contrast invariance. This model, using broad and similar orientation tuning for its excitatory and inhibitory inputs, accounts for the acute orientation acuity of human vision and proves to be robust despite the variance found in natural stimuli.},

Directed attention has been shown to bias competition in favor of the attended stimulus in extrastriate cortex. Here, we show that suppressive interactions among multiple stimuli are eliminated in extrastriate cortex when they are presented in the context of pop-out displays, in which a single item differs from the others, but not in heterogeneous displays, in which all items differ from each other.

In the experiment presented here we disrupted activity in right or left parietal cortex by applying repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) over these areas while subjects attempted to detect changes between two images separated by a brief interval (i.e. 1-shot change detection task). We found that rTMS applied over right parietal cortex but not left parietal cortex resulted in longer latencies to detect changes and a greater rate of change blindness compared with no TMS.

abstract = {Our understanding of human visual perception generally rests on the assumption that conscious visual states represent the interaction of spatial structures in the environment and our nervous system. This assumption is questioned by circumstances where conscious visual states can be triggered by external stimulation which is not primarily spatially defined. Here, subjective colors and forms are evoked by flickering light while the precise nature of those experiences varies over flicker frequency and phase. What’s more, the occurrence of one subjective experience appears to be associated with the occurrence of others. While these data indicate that conscious visual experience may be evoked directly by particular variations in the flow of spatially unstructured light over time, it must be assumed that the systems responsible are essentially temporal in character and capable of representing a variety of visual forms and colors, coded in different frequencies or at different phases of the same processing rhythm.},

We found that (i) magnetic stimulation of V5 at intervals of -20 to +10 ms before or after the onset of visual stimulation was effective in abolishing motion perception--other delays were not; (ii) magnetic stimulation of V1 abolished motion perception only marginally and at delays which were significantly different from those obtained with V5, the stimulation now being effective only at delays of 60-70 ms after the onset of visual stimulation. We conclude (i) that stimulation of V5 is a much more potent way of inducing akinetopsia (motion imperception) than stimulation of V1; (ii) that perceptually effective visual motion signals reach V5 at or before 30 ms and reach V1 at or before 60 ms--consequently, perceptually effective motion signals reach V5 before they reach V1; (iii) that, given the time course of arrival of signals in V1 and V5, it takes about 30-50 ms for signals from V1 to reach V5. We conclude further that there are probably two components reaching V5 from the retina, a fast one which bypasses V1 and a slow one which reaches it through V1.},

abstract = {When correlation is measured in the presence of noise, its value is decreased. In single-neuron recording experiments, for example, the correlation of selectivity indices in a pair of tasks may be assessed across neurons but, because the number of trials is limited, the measured index values for each neuron will be noisy. This attenuates the correlation. A correction for such attenuation was proposed by Spearman more than 100 years ago, and more recent work has shown how confidence intervals may be constructed to supplement the correction. In this paper, we propose an alternative Bayesian correction. A simulation study shows that this approach can be far superior to Spearman’s, both in accuracy of the correction and in coverage of the resulting confidence intervals. We demonstrate the usefulness of this technology by applying it to a set of data obtained from the frontal cortex of a macaque monkey while performing serial order and variable reward saccade tasks. There, the correction results in a substantial increase in the correlation across neurons in the two tasks.},

Activation of these afferents can regulate neuronal excitability, transmitter release, and firing patterns in thalamic networks, thereby altering the flow of sensory information during distinct behavioural states. However, cholinergic regulation in the thalamus has been primarily examined by using receptor agonist and antagonist, which has precluded a detailed understanding of the spatiotemporal dynamics that govern cholinergic signalling under physiological conditions. This review summarizes recent studies on cholinergic synaptic transmission in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a brain structure intimately involved in the control of sensory processing and the generation of rhythmic activity in the thalamocortical system. This work has shown that acetylcholine (ACh) released from individual axons can rapidly and reliably activate both pre- and postsynaptic cholinergic receptors, thereby controlling TRN neuronal activity with high spatiotemporal precision.},

Previous models have argued that perceptual learning is due to either sharpening and amplification of tuning curves in early visual areas or to improved probabilistic inference in later visual areas (at the decision stage). However, early theories are inconsistent with the conclusions of psychophysical experiments manipulating external noise, whereas late theories cannot explain the changes in neural responses that have been reported in cortical areas V1 and V4. Here we show that we can capture both the neurophysiological and behavioral aspects of perceptual learning by altering only the feedforward connectivity in a recurrent network of spiking neurons so as to improve probabilistic inference in early visual areas. The resulting network shows modest changes in tuning curves, in line with neurophysiological reports, along with a marked reduction in the amplitude of pairwise noise correlations.},

abstract = {1. Short iontophoretic pulses of acetylcholine (ACh) inhibited almost every spontaneously active cell encountered in the nucleus reticularis thalami of cats anaesthetized with a mixture of halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen. On 200 cells the mean current needed to eject an effective inhibitory dose of ACh was 67 +/- 2 nA. When the ACh-evoked inhibition was mimicked by gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) or glycine on the same cell, the current required to release ACh was found to be approximately twice as great as that required to release an equally effective dose of GABA or glycine. 2. ACh inhibitions developed with a latency which was very much shorter than that for ACh excitation in cells of the ventrobasal complex. The latency of the ACh-evoked inhibition was as rapid as the onset and offset of the excitation of the same cells glutamate and their inhibition by GABA or glycine. 3. The firing pattern of ACh-inhibited neurones in the nucleus reticularis was characterized by periods of prolonged, high frequency bursts, and their mean firing frequency was 22 Hz. Raster dot displays and interspike interval histograms showed that whereas ACh suppressed the spikes that occurred between bursts much more readily than those that occurred during bursts, all spikes were equally sensitive to the depressant action of GABA and glycine. Large doses of ACh provoked or exaggerated burst activity. 4. ACh-evoked inhibition was extremely sensitive to blockade by short iontophoretic applications of atropine, which had no effect on the inhibitions evoked on the same cell equipotent doses of GABA or glycine. The ACh-evoked inhibitions were also antagonized by dihydro-beta-erythroidine released with slightly larger currents. When tested on the same cell, small iontophoretic applications of picrotoxin and bicuculline methoiodide blocked the inhibition evoked by GABA but had no effect on that evoked by ACh. Iontophoretic strychnine only rarely affected the inhibition evoked by ACh, while readily blocking the inhibition evoked on the same cell by an equipotent dose of glycine. In two cats, intravenous strychnine (1-2 mg/kg) had no effect on the ACh-evoked inhibition, while greatly reducing the sensitivity of the cell under study to glycine. 5. Only four out of forty-eight ACh-inhibted cells tested were inhibited by iontophoretic applications of either guanosine or adenosine 3’:5’-phosphate. 6. Cells of the nucleus reticularis have been shown to have an inhibitory action on the thalamic relay cells, which are excited by ACh. It is suggested that the presence of both ACh excited and inhibited cells in different nuclei of the thalamus could be of considerable functional significance in gating sensory transmission through the thalamus.},

abstract = {Attentional modulation of neuronal responsiveness is common in many areas of visual cortex. We examined whether attentional modulation in the visual thalamus was quantitatively similar to that in cortex. Identical procedures and apparatus were used to compare attentional modulation of single neurons in seven different areas of the visual system: the lateral geniculate, three visual subdivisions of the pulvinar [inferior, lateral, dorsomedial part of lateral pulvinar (Pdm)], and three areas of extrastriate cortex representing early, intermediate, and late stages of cortical processing (V2, V4/PM, area 7a). A simple fixation task controlled transitions among three attentive states. The animal waited for a fixation point to appear (ready state), fixated the point until it dimmed (fixation state), and then waited idly to begin the next trial (idle state). Attentional modulation was estimated by flashing an identical, irrelevant stimulus in a neuron’s receptive field during each of the three states; the three responses defined a &quot;response vector&quot; whose deviation from the line of equal response in all three states (the main diagonal) indicated the character and magnitude of attentional modulation. Attentional modulation was present in all visual areas except the lateral geniculate, indicating that modulation was of central origin. Prevalence of modulation was modest (26%) in pulvinar, and increased from 21% in V2 to 43% in 7a. Modulation had a push-pull character (as many cells facilitated as suppressed) with respect to the fixation state in all areas except Pdm where all cells were suppressed during fixation. The absolute magnitude of attentional modulation, measured by the angle between response vector and main diagonal expressed as a percent of the maximum possible angle, differed among brain areas. Magnitude of modulation was modest in the pulvinar (19-26%), and increased from 22% in V2 to 41% in 7a. However, average trial-to-trial variability of response, measured by the coefficient of variation, also increased across brain areas so that its difference among areas accounted for more than 90% of the difference in modulation magnitude among areas. We also measured attentional modulation by the ratio of cell discharge due to attention divided by discharge variability. The resulting signal-to-noise ratio of attention was small and constant, 1.3 +/- 10%, across all areas of pulvinar and cortex. We conclude that the pulvinar, but not the lateral geniculate, is as strongly affected by attentional state as any area of visual cortex we studied and that attentional modulation amplitude is closely tied to intrinsic variability of response.},

Benevento (1977) Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 3:573; Rezak, M. (1978) Soc. Neurosci. Abstr. 4: 642), of macaque monkeys. PL gamma receives convergent inputs from the occipital cortex and has strong reciprocal interconnections with the visual association cortex, including the inferotemporal cortex (areas 20 and 21). It was found the that PL gamma has a poor or nonexistent retinotopic organization. Many of the neurons had large, unflanked, overlapping receptive fields which often included the fovea. A few neurons could be influenced by a visual stimulus placed anywhere in the visual field described by a tangent screen. The receptive fields could be bilateral or located entirely within the contralateral or ipsilateral hemifields. The majority of units were binocular and exhibited various types of binocular interaction which could be quite complex. The binocular response was not predictable from the algebraic sum of the monocular responses and could be of the opposite sign (e.g., excitatory when the monocular response was inhibitory). Neurons which were also sensitive to the direction of movement of stimuli projected upon the tangent screen formed a major group. Of the units sensitive to tangentially moving stimuli, two special subgroups were found. One group of neurons gave sustained responses to static levels of luminance, while the other group was sensitive to simuli which moved toward or away from the eyes. The nonlinear rate of change of the apparent size of approaching or receding stimuli was described by a mathematical function which also describes the response of the neurons to the same stimuli. For many of these units which were sensitive to tangentially moving stimuli and one other class of stimuli, such as luminance levels of movement in depth, the responses to one class were seemingly unrelated to the responses to the other class. The same statement may be made for monocular and binocular responses. It may be, then, that different wiring diagrams describe these different types of inputs. These physiological results are discussed in terms of the inputs to PL gamma as well as its cortical targets.},

abstract = {The nonretinotopic portion of the macaque pulvinar complex is interconnected with the occipitoparietal and occipitotemporal transcortical visual systems where information about the location and motion of a visual object or its form and color are modulated by eye movements and attention. We recorded from single cells in and about the border of the dorsal portion of the lateral pulvinar and the adjacent medial pulvinar of awake behaving Macaca mulatta in order to determine how the properties of these two functionally dichotomous cortical systems were represented. We found a class of pulvinar neurons that responded differentially to ten different patterns or broadband wavelengths (colors). Thirty-four percent of cells tested responded to the presentation of at least one of the pattern or color stimuli. These cells often discharged to several of the patterns or colors, but responded best to only one or two of them, and 86% were found to have statistically significant pattern and/or color preferences. Pattern/color preferential cells had an average latency of 79.1 +/- 46.0 ms (range 31-186 ms), responding well before most inferotemporal cortical cell responses. Visually guided and memory-guided saccade tasks showed that 58% of pattern/color preferential cells also had saccade-related properties, e.g. directional presaccadic and postsaccadic discharges, and inhibition of activity during the saccade. In the pulvinar, the mean presacadic response latency was earlier, and the mean postsaccadic response latency was later, than those reported for parietal cortex. We also discovered that the strength of response to patterns or colors changed depending upon the behavioral setting. In comparison to trials in which the monkey fixated dead ahead during passive presentations of pattern and color stimuli, 92% of the cells showed attenuated responses to the same passive presentation of patterns and colors during fixation when these trials were interleaved with trials which also required active saccades to pattern and color targets in the periphery. We conclude that properties which represent the functionally dichotomous object and spatial visual systems are found together in single pulvinar neurons and that the responses of these cells to pattern or color stimuli are influenced by the focus of spatial attention. The pulvinar is the first structure in the brain shown to have neurons which integrate both object and spatial properties and the response latencies indicate that this information is processed before that in cortex. These results are discussed in terms of role of the pulvinar in visual attention as well as its unique role in providing both object feature and spatial location information to the inferotemporal cortex.},

abstract = {To manage populations, whether of threatened, exploited, or pest species, or even of parasites or pathogens in hosts, we must be able to predict their population dynamics, and to do this, we need to understand the underlying processes. An important recent focus is the way that deterministic density-dependent processes interact with random influences (”noise”) to create novel patterns in the dynamics. Such noise typically has two sources. First, environmental noise is driven by changes in extrinsic processes (such as climate and resource availability). Second, demographic noise is the random way individuals progress through their life history and arises through the “discreteness of individuality”: an organism can be male or female, dead or alive, but the “vital rate” (sex ratio, survival, fecundity) may be noninteger. In large populations, demographic stochasticity can be ignored because it is averaged across a large number of individuals. So, at any point in time or space, the population will typically be very close to the average, but in small populations, the deviation between the population average and the realized value at any particular time may be considerable. The “strength” of demographic noise is inversely related to the square root of population size, and a general question that is asked by Reuman et al. (1) in this issue of PNAS is “how does demographic noise of different strengths affect dynamics?”},

We first characterized the population response to a single orientation. As response amplitude grew, the population tuning width remained constant for membrane potential responses and became progressively sharper for spike responses. We then asked how these single-orientation responses combine to code for successive orientations. We found that they combined through simple linear summation. Linearity, however, was violated after stimulus offset, when responses exhibited an unexplained persistence. As a result of linearity, the interactions between responses to successive stimuli were minimal. Our results indicate that higher cortical areas may reconstruct the stimulus sequence from V1 population responses through a simple instantaneous decoder. Therefore, spatial and temporal codes in area V1 operate largely independently.},

However, backpropagating action potentials (BPAPs) have been studied mainly in slices, in which they are highly sensitive to multiple factors such as firing frequency and membrane conductance, raising doubts about their effectiveness in the awake behaving brain. Here, we examine the spatiotemporal characteristics of BPAPs in layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the visual cortex of adult, awake rabbits, in which EEG-defined brain states ranged from alert vigilance to drowsy/inattention, and, in some cases, to light sleep. To achieve this, we recorded extracellular spikes from layer 5 pyramidal neurons and field potentials above and below these neurons using a 16-channel linear probe, and applied methods of spike-triggered current source-density analysis to these records (Buzs√°ki and Kandel, 1998; Swadlow et al., 2002). Precise retinotopic alignment of superficial and deep cortical sites was used to optimize alignment of the recording probe with the axis of the apical dendrite. During the above network states, we studied BPAPs generated spontaneously, antidromically (from corticotectal neurons), or via intense synaptic drive caused by natural visual stimulation. Surprisingly, the invasion of BPAPs as far as 800 microm from the soma was little affected by the network state and only mildly attenuated by high firing frequencies. These data reveal that the BPAP is a robust and highly reliable property of neocortical apical dendrites. These events, therefore, are well suited to provide crucial signals for the control of synaptic plasticity during information-processing brain states.},

Here, we show that the stable storage limits of visual working memory for over 9 s are bound by the precise gray matter volume of primary visual cortex (V1), defined by fMRI retinotopic mapping. Individuals with a bigger V1 tended to have greater visual working memory storage. This relationship was present independently for both surface size and thickness of V1 but absent in V2, V3 and for non-visual working memory measures. Additional whole-brain analyses confirmed the specificity of the relationship to V1. Our findings indicate that the size of primary visual cortex plays a critical role in limiting what we can hold in mind, acting like a gatekeeper in constraining the richness of working mental function.},

abstract = {The idea of a second visual pathway, in which visual signals travel from brainstem to cortex via the pulvinar thalamus, has had considerable influence as an alternative to the primary geniculo-striate pathway. Existence of this second pathway in primates, however, is not well established. A major question centers on whether the pulvinar acts as a relay, particularly in the path from the superior colliculus (SC) to the motion area in middle temporal cortex (MT). We used physiological microstimulation to identify pulvinar neurons belonging to the path from SC to MT in the macaque. We made three salient observations. First, we identified many neurons in the visual pulvinar that received input from SC or projected to MT, as well as a largely separate set of neurons that received input from MT. Second, and more importantly, we identified a subset of neurons as relay neurons that both received SC input and projected to MT. The identification of these relay neurons demonstrates a continuous functional path from SC to MT through the pulvinar in primates. Third, we histologically localized a subset of SC-MT relay neurons to the subdivision of inferior pulvinar known to project densely to MT but also localized SC-MT relay neurons to an adjacent subdivision. This pattern indicates that the pulvinar pathway is not limited to a single anatomically defined region. These findings bring new perspective to the functional organization of the pulvinar and its role in conveying signals to the cerebral cortex.},

abstract = {We previously established a functional pathway extending from the superficial layers of the superior colliculus (SC) through the inferior pulvinar (PI) to cortical area MT in the primate (Macaca mulatta). Here, we characterized the signals that this pathway conveys to cortex by recording from pulvinar neurons that we identified by microstimulation as receiving input from SC and/or projecting to MT. The basic properties of these ascending-path PI neurons resembled those of SC visual neurons. Namely, they had brisk responses to spots of light, inhibitory surrounds, and relatively large receptive fields that increased with eccentricity, as well as minimal presaccadic activity. Beyond these basic properties, there were two salient results regarding the modulatory and motion signals conveyed by this ascending pathway. First, the PI neurons appeared to convey only a subset of the modulations found in the SC: they exhibited saccadic suppression, the inhibition of activity at the time of the saccade, but did not clearly show the attentional enhancement of the visual response seen in SC. Second, directional selectivity was minimal in PI neurons belonging to the ascending path but was significantly more prominent in PI neurons receiving input from MT. This finding casts doubt on earlier assumptions that PI provides directionally selective signals to MT and instead suggests that PI derives its selectivity from MT. The identification of this pathway and its transmitted activity establishes the first functional pathway from brainstem to cortex through pulvinar and makes it possible to examine its contribution to cortical visual processing, perception, and action.},

We model and interpret the results of recent experiments and provide predictions for future testing. The stimuli are frames of a morphing film, interpolating between two memorized faces: If the temporal order of presentation of the frame stimuli is random, then the structure of memory is basically unaffected by synaptic plasticity (memory preservation). If the temporal order is sequential, then all image frames are classified as the same memory (memory collapse). The empirical findings are reproduced in the simulated dynamics of the network, in which the evolution of neural activity is conditioned by the associated synaptic plasticity (learning). The results are captured by theoretical analysis, which leads to predictions concerning the critical parameters of the stimuli; a third phase is identified in which memory is erased (forgetting).},

A moving object can cover a considerable distance in this time, and should therefore be seen noticeably behind its actual location. As this conflicts with everyday experience, it has been suggested that the visual cortex uses the delayed visual data from the eye to extrapolate the trajectory of a moving object, so that it is perceived at its actual location. Here we report that such anticipation of moving stimuli begins in the retina. A moving bar elicits a moving wave of spiking activity in the population of retinal ganglion cells. Rather than lagging behind the visual image, the population activity travels near the leading edge of the moving bar [isn’t this what you’d expect??? What about a single edge stimulus??]. This response is observed over a wide range of speeds and apparently compensates for the visual response latency. We show how this anticipation follows from known mechanisms of retinal processing},

Yet, the neural mechanisms that may allow such dynamic routing of the information flow are not yet fully understood. We investigated the role of gamma band (50-80 Hz) oscillations in transient modulations of communication among neural populations by using measures of direction-specific causal information transfer. We found that the local phase of gamma-band rhythmic activity exerted a stimulus-modulated and spatially-asymmetric directed effect on the firing rate of spatially separated populations within the primary visual cortex. The relationships between gamma phases at different sites (phase shifts) could be described as a stimulus-modulated gamma-band wave propagating along the spatial directions with the largest information transfer. We observed transient stimulus-related changes in the spatial configuration of phases (compatible with changes in direction of gamma wave propagation) accompanied by a relative increase of the amount of information flowing along the instantaneous direction of the gamma wave. These effects were specific to the gamma-band and suggest that the time-varying relationships between gamma phases at different locations mark, and possibly causally mediate, the dynamic reconfiguration of functional connections.},

The elements forming the path could be oriented either parallel (’snakes’) or perpendicular to the contour orientation (’ladders’). Sensitivity to contour structure (estimated by measuring the maximum tolerable element orientation jitter supporting contour detection) was increased when the elements were drifting or flickering. Snakes were more detectable than ladders under all conditions. The increase in sensitivity conferred by drifting carriers was present even when the elements in the same stimulus were drifting at a range of speeds spanning almost three octaves. These results lend further support to the notion that the contour integration system receives separate transient and sustained input.},

abstract = {To gain insight into how vision guides eye movements, monkeys were trained to make a single saccade to a specified target stimulus during feature and conjunction search with stimuli discriminated by color and shape. Monkeys performed both tasks at levels well above chance. The latencies of saccades to the target in conjunction search exhibited shallow positive slopes as a function of set size, comparable to slopes of reaction time of humans during target present/absent judgments, but significantly different than the slopes in feature search. Properties of the selection process were revealed by the occasional saccades to distractors. During feature search, errant saccades were directed more often to a distractor near the target than to a distractor at any other location. In contrast, during conjunction search, saccades to distractors were guided more by similarity than proximity to the target; monkeys were significantly more likely to shift gaze to a distractor that had one of the target features than to a distractor that had none. Overall, color and shape information were used to similar degrees in the search for the conjunction target. However, in single sessions we observed an increased tendency of saccades to a distractor that had been the target in the previous experimental session. The establishment of this tendency across sessions at least a day apart and its persistence throughout a session distinguish this phenomenon from the short-term (<10 trials) perceptual priming observed in this and earlier studies using feature visual search. Our findings support the hypothesis that the target in at least some conjunction visual searches can be detected efficiently based on visual similarity, most likely through parallel processing of the individual features that define the stimuli. These observations guide the interpretation of neurophysiological data and constrain the development of computational models.},

This feature-based facilitation of return was manifested in the target discrimination process in FEF: neurons discriminated the target from distractors earlier and better with repetition of stimulus features, corresponding to improvements in saccade latency and accuracy, respectively. The neuronal target selection was mediated by both target enhancement and distractor suppression. In contrast to the repetition of features, repetition of target position increased saccade latency. This location-based inhibition of return was reflected in the neuronal discrimination process but not in the baseline activity in FEF.

While movement-related neurons were activated maximally when the target of the search array was in their movement field, they were also activated for distractors even though a saccade was successfully made to the target outside the movement field. Most importantly, the level of activation depended on the properties of the distractor, with greater activation for distractors that shared a target feature or were the target during the previous session during conjunction search, and for the singleton distractor during feature search.

We monitored activity in the frontal eye field (FEF) of monkeys trained to make a saccade to a target defined by the conjunction of color and shape or to a target defined by color differences. The difficulty of conjunction search was manipulated by varying the number of distractors, and the difficulty of feature search was manipulated by varying the similarity in color between target and distractors. The reliability of individual neurons in signaling the target location in correct trials was determined using a neuron-anti-neuron approach within a winner-take-all architecture. On average, approximately seven trials of the activity of single neurons were sufficient to match near-perfect behavioral performance in the easiest search, and approximately 14 trials were sufficient in the most difficult search. We also determined how many neurons recorded separately need to be evaluated within a trial to match behavioral performance. Results were quantitatively similar to those of the single neuron analysis. We also found that signal reliability in the FEF did not change with task demands, and overall, behavioral accuracy across the search tasks was approximated when only six trials or neurons were combined. Furthermore, whether combining trials or neurons, the increase in time of target discrimination corresponded to the increase in mean saccade latency across visual search difficulty levels. Finally, the variance of spike counts in the FEF increased as a function of the mean spike count, and the parameters of this relationship did not change with attentional selection.},

abstract = {When examining a complex image, the eye movements of expert observers differ from those of novices; experts have learned to ignore features that are visually salient but are not relevant to the interpretation of the image. We have studied the neural basis of this form of perceptual-motor learning using monkeys that have learned to search for a visual target among distractors. Monkeys trained to search only for, say, a red stimulus among green distractors will ignore green stimuli even if they subsequently appear as targets in a complementary search array, that is, among red distractors. We recorded from neurons in the frontal eye field (FEF), a cortical area that responds to visual stimuli and controls purposive eye movements. Normally, FEF neurons do not exhibit feature selectivity, but their activity evolves to signal the target for an incipient eye movement. In monkeys trained exclusively on targets of one colour, however, FEF neurons show selectivity for stimuli of that colour. Because this selective response occurs so soon after presentation of the stimulus array, and is independent of location within the visual field, we propose that it reflects a form of experience-dependent plasticity that mediates the learning of arbitrary stimulus-response associations.},

abstract = {The idea that dorsal thalamic inputs can be divided into “drivers”, which provide the primary excitatory drive for the relay of information to cortex, and “modulators”, which alter the gain of signal transmission, has provided a valuable organizing principle for the study of thalamic function. This view further promoted the identification of “first order” and “higher order” thalamic nuclei, based on the origin of their driving inputs. Since the introduction of this influential terminology, a number of studies have revealed the existence of a wide variety of thalamic organizational schemes. For example, some thalamic nuclei are not innervated by typical driver inputs, but instead receive input from terminals which exhibit features distinct from those of either classic drivers or modulators. In addition, many thalamic nuclei contain unique combinations of convergent first order, higher order, and/or other “driver-like” inputs that do not conform with the driver/modulator framework. The assortment of synaptic arrangements identified in the thalamus are reviewed and discussed from the perspective that this organizational diversity can dramatically increase the computational capabilities of the thalamus, reflecting its essential roles in sensory, motor, and sensory-motor circuits.},

abstract = {We examined the synaptic targets of large non-gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA)-ergic profiles that contain round vesicles and dark mitochondria (RLD profiles) in the perigeniculate nucleus (PGN) and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). RLD profiles can provisionally be identified as the collaterals of thalamocortical axons, because their ultrastrucure is distinct from all other previously described dLGN inputs. We also found that RLD profiles are larger than cholinergic terminals and contain the type 2 vesicular glutamate transporter. RLD profiles are distributed throughout the PGN and are concentrated within the interlaminar zones (IZs) of the dLGN, regions distinguished by dense binding of Wisteria floribunda agglutinin (WFA). To determine the synaptic targets of thalamocortical axon collaterals, we examined RLD profiles in the PGN and dLGN in tissue stained for GABA. For the PGN, we found that all RLD profiles make synaptic contacts with GABAergic PGN somata, dendrites, and spines. In the dLGN, RLD profiles primarily synapse with GABAergic dendrites that contain vesicles (F2 profiles) and non-GABAergic dendrites in glomerular arrangements that include triads. Occasional synapses on GABAergic somata and proximal dendrites were also observed in the dLGN. These results suggest that correlated dLGN activity may be enhanced via direct synaptic contacts between thalamocortical cells, whereas noncorrelated activity (such as that occurring during binocular rivalry) could be suppressed via thalamocortical collateral input to PGN cells and dLGN interneurons.},

BNOS was found in both cells and fibers throughout the visual thalamus. BNOS-stained cells were found consistently in the C laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the pulvinar nucleus, and the lateral posterior nucleus (LP). In the A laminae of the LGN, variable numbers of BNOS-stained cells also could be detected. BNOS-stained cells were identified as a subset of interneurons because they all stained for glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD), but not all GAD-stained cells contained BNOS. The average soma area of BNOS-stained cells was slightly greater than the average soma area of GAD-stained cells. BNOS-stained cells display a distinctive dendritic morphology, which is consistent with previous descriptions of class V neurons (Updyke [1979] J. Comp. Neurol. 186:603-619); they have widespread but fairly sparse arbors of thin, somewhat beaded dendrites. BNOS-stained cells participate in a distinct synaptic circuitry. Although many GAD-stained profiles are filled with vesicles and participate in complex synaptic arrangements, known as glomeruli, BNOS-stained dendrites contain small clusters of vesicles and form dendrodendritic contacts in the extraglomerular neuropil. Thus, there appear to be at least two types of gamma-aminobutyric acidergic interneurons in the visual thalamus of the cat. Interneurons that do not contain BNOS (class III morphology) may exert their effects primarily within synaptic glomeruli (Hamos et al. [1985] Nature 317:618-621), whereas interneurons that contain BNOS (class V morphology) contribute primarily to the extraglomerular neuropil Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

abstract = {The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is the thalamic relay of retinal information to cortex. An extensive complement of nonretinal inputs to the LGN combine to modulate the responsiveness of relay cells to their retinal inputs, and thus control the transfer of visual information to cortex. These inputs have been studied in the most detail in the cat. The goal of the present study was to determine whether the neurotransmitters used by nonretinal afferents to the monkey LGN are similar to those identified in the cat. By combining the retrograde transport of tracers injected into the monkey LGN with immunocytochemical labeling for choline acetyl transferase, brain nitric oxide synthase, glutamic acid decarboxylase, tyrosine hydroxylase, or the histochemical nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH)-diaphorase reaction, we determined that the organization of neurotransmitter inputs to the monkey LGN is strikingly similar to the patterns occurring in the cat. In particular, we found that the monkey LGN receives a significant cholinergic/nitrergic projection from the pedunculopontine tegmentum, γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA)ergic projections from the thalamic reticular nucleus and pretectum, and a cholinergic projection from the parabigeminal nucleus. The major difference between the innervation of the LGN in the cat and the monkey is the absence of a noradrenergic projection to the monkey LGN. The segregation of the noradrenergic cells and cholinergic cells in the monkey brainstem also differs from the intermingled arrangement found in the cat brainstem. Our findings suggest that studies of basic mechanisms underlying the control of visual information flow through the LGN of the cat may relate directly to similar issues in primates, and ultimately, humans.

Brightness enhancement by orientation contrast is associated with an increase of discharge rates of responses to the center grating but not with changes in spike synchronization. In contrast, if brightness enhancement is induced by phase offset, discharge rates are unchanged but synchronization increases between neurons responding to the center grating. The changes in synchronization correlate well with changes in perceived brightness that were assessed in parallel in human subjects using the same stimuli. These results indicate that in cerebral cortex the modulation of synchronicity of responses is used as a mechanism complementary to rate changes to enhance the saliency of neuronal responses.},

abstract = {The development of stimulus selectivity in the primary sensory cortex of higher vertebrates is considered in a general mathematical framework. A synaptic evolution scheme of a new kind is proposed in which incoming patterns rather than converging afferents compete. The change in the efficacy of a given synapse depends not only on instantaneous pre- and postsynaptic activities but also on a slowly varying time-averaged value of the postsynaptic activity. Assuming an appropriate nonlinear form for this dependence, development of selectivity is obtained under quite general conditions on the sensory environment. One does not require nonlinearity of the neuron’s integrative power nor does one need to assume any particular form for intracortical circuitry. This is first illustrated in simple cases, e.g., when the environment consists of only two different stimuli presented alternately in a random manner. The following formal statement then holds: the state of the system converges with probability 1 to points of maximum selectivity in the state space. We next consider the problem of early development of orientation selectivity and binocular interaction in primary visual cortex. Giving the environment an appropriate form, we obtain orientation tuning curves and ocular dominance comparable to what is observed in normally reared adult cats or monkeys. Simulations with binocular input and various types of normal or altered environments show good agreement with the relevant experimental data. Experiments are suggested that could test our theory further.},

To address this deficit, we explored the relationship between ordinary stimulus-controlled pattern perception and the autonomous hallucinatory geometrical pattern formation that occurs for unstructured visual stimulation (e.g., empty-field flicker). We found that flicker-induced hallucinations are biased by the presentation of adjacent geometrical stimuli; geometrical forms that map to cortical area V1 as orthogonal gratings are perceptually opponent in biasing hallucinations. Rotating fan blades and pulsating circular patterns are the most salient biased hallucinations. Apparent motion and fractal (1/f) noise are also effective in driving hallucinatory pattern formation (the latter is consistent with predictions of spatiotemporal pattern formation driven by stochastic resonance). The behavior of these percepts suggests that self-organized hallucinatory pattern formation in human vision is governed by the same cortical properties of localized processing, lateral inhibition, simultaneous contrast, and nonlinear retinotopic mapping that govern ordinary vision.},

This review will examine two aspects of visual attention: the changes in neural responses within visual cortices due to the allocation of covert attention; and the neural activity in higher cortical areas involved in guiding the allocation of attention. The first section will highlight processes that occur during visual spatial attention and feature-based attention in cortical visual areas and several related models that have recently been proposed to explain this activity. The second section will focus on the parietofrontal network thought to be involved in targeting eye movements and allocating covert attention. It will describe evidence that the lateral intraparietal area, frontal eye field and superior colliculus are involved in the guidance of visual attention, and describe the priority map model, which is thought to operate in at least several of these areas.},

abstract = {Recent studies, conducted almost exclusively in primates, have shown that several cortical areas usually associated with modality-specific sensory processing are subject to influences from other senses. Here we demonstrate using single-unit recordings and estimates of mutual information that visual stimuli can influence the activity of units in the auditory cortex of anesthetized ferrets. In many cases, these units were also acoustically responsive and frequently transmitted more information in their spike discharge patterns in response to paired visual-auditory stimulation than when either modality was presented by itself. For each stimulus, this information was conveyed by a combination of spike count and spike timing. Even in primary auditory areas (primary auditory cortex [A1] and anterior auditory field [AAF]), approximately 15% of recorded units were found to have nonauditory input. This proportion increased in the higher level fields that lie ventral to A1/AAF and was highest in the anterior ventral field, where nearly 50% of the units were found to be responsive to visual stimuli only and a further quarter to both visual and auditory stimuli. Within each field, the pure-tone response properties of neurons sensitive to visual stimuli did not differ in any systematic way from those of visually unresponsive neurons. Neural tracer injections revealed direct inputs from visual cortex into auditory cortex, indicating a potential source of origin for the visual responses. Primary visual cortex projects sparsely to A1, whereas higher visual areas innervate auditory areas in a field-specific manner. These data indicate that multisensory convergence and integration are features common to all auditory cortical areas but are especially prevalent in higher areas.},

Cells were classified as X (linear) or Y (non-linear) on the basis of their responses to contrast-reversing achromatic gratings (’null position test’). In older animals virtually all parvocellular neurones and the majority of magnocellular units were X cells; only about 15% of magnocellular neurones displayed highly non-linear spatial summation, with no ‘null position’, typical of Y cells. X cells could not reliably be distinguished from Y cells, nor magnocellular from parvocellular, on the basis of their temporal patterns of discharge. Some Y cells responded transiently to contrast reversal of a grating far from the receptive field but X cells showed little or no such ‘shift effect’. The spatial resolution of mature l.g.n. cells varied with the eccentricity of their receptive fields such that the best of them, at each point in the visual field, resolved drifting achromatic gratings about as well as a human observer. X cells in parvocellular and magnocellular layers had similar ‘acuities’, even in the central foveal representation, but Y cells generally had poorer resolution. Receptive fields in the temporal retina tended to have lower resolution than those at comparable eccentricities in the nasal retina. Even on the day of birth all cells we studied responded to visual stimulation and virtually all could be classified as X or Y. The laminar distribution of cell types and the general morphological appearance of the nucleus seemed very similar to those in the adult, but neurones in very young animals had low spontaneous activity, sluggish responses, and latencies to visual stimulation longer than any we saw in the adult. Until 3 weeks of age or so, many neurones suffered cumulative ‘fatigue’ when visually stimulated over several minutes. Visual latency was essentially mature by about 10 weeks. In the l.g.n. of the neonatal monkey there was little variation in neuronal ‘acuity’ with eccentricity: even in the foveal area the best cells could resolve only about 5 cycles/deg. Over the first year or more of life there is a gradual increase in responsiveness and about a 7-fold improvement in spatial resolution for foveal l.g.n. cells, correlating roughly with the behavioural maturation of visual acuity.},

Selective attention to red (or to green) alters the perceived direction of motion and is found to be equivalent to increasing the physical redness (or greenness) by 25-117%, depending on the observer and color.

We used a colour-contingent motion after-effect (CCMAE) to study the binding of colour and motion signals. The logic of our approach was as follows: if CCMAEs can be evoked by targeted adaptation of early motion processing stages, without allowing for feedback from higher motion integration stages, then this would support our hypothesis that colour and motion are bound automatically on the basis of spatiotemporally local information. Our results show for the first time that CCMAE’s can be evoked by adaptation to a locally paired opposite-motion dot display, a stimulus that, importantly, is known to trigger direction-specific responses in the primary visual cortex yet results in strong inhibition of the directional responses in area MT of macaques as well as in area MT+ in humans and, indeed, is perceived only as motionless flicker. The magnitude of the CCMAE in the locally paired condition was not significantly different from control conditions where the different directions were spatiotemporally separated (i.e. not locally paired) and therefore perceived as two moving fields. These findings provide evidence that adaptation at an early, local motion stage, and only adaptation at this stage, underlies this CCMAE, which in turn implies that spatiotemporally coincident colour and motion signals are bound automatically, most probably as early as cortical area V1, even when the association between colour and motion is perceptually inaccessible.},

Relay neuron spike patterns do not simply reflect those of RGCs, but the mechanisms controlling this transformation are not well understood. We therefore examined synaptic properties controlling the strength and precision of relay neuron firing in mouse (p28-33) brain slices using physiological stimulation patterns and a combination of current clamp and dynamic clamp. In tonic mode (-55 mV), activation of single RGC inputs elicited stereotyped responses in a given neuron. In contrast, responses in different neurons varied from unreliable, to faithfully following, to a gain in the number of spikes. Dynamic clamp experiments indicated these different responses primarily reflected variability in the amplitudes of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) and AMPA components. Each of these components played a distinct role in transmission. The AMPA component evoked a single precisely timed, short-latency spike per stimulus, but efficacy decreased during repetitive stimulation due to desensitization and depression. The NMDA component elicited longer-latency spikes and multiple spikes per stimulus and became more effective during repetitive stimuli that led to NMDA current summation. We found that in burst mode (-75 mV), where low-threshold calcium spikes are activated, AMPA and NMDA components and synaptic plasticity influenced spike number, but no combination enabled relay cells to faithfully follow the stimulus. Thus the characteristics of AMPA and NMDA currents, the ratio of these currents and use-dependent plasticity interact to shape how RGC activity is conveyed to relay neurons},

We show that surround suppression appears in search tasks that require spatial scrutiny, that is the precise binding of search-relevant features at the target’s location but not in tasks that permit target discrimination without precise localization. Furthermore, we demonstrate that surround attenuation is linked with a stronger recurrent activity modulation in early visual cortex. Finally, we show that surround suppression appears with a delay (more than 175 ms) that is beyond the time course of the initial feedforward sweep of processing in the visual system. These observations together indicate that the suppressive surround is associated with recurrent processing and binding in the visual cortex.},

Functional connectivity is thought to be achieved via corticothalamic/thalamocortical white matter pathways. Our study investigates structural connectivity between Broca’s area and the thalamus, specifically ventral anterior nucleus and pulvinar. We demonstrate that Broca’s area shares direct connections with these thalamic nuclei and suggest a local Broca’s area-thalamus network potentially involved in linguistic processing. Thalamic connectivity with Broca’s area may serve to selectively recruit cortical regions storing multimodal features of lexical items and to bind them together during lexical-semantic processing. In addition, Broca’s area-thalamic circuitry may enable cortico-thalamo-cortical information transfer and modulation between BA 44 and 45 during language comprehension and production.},

These phenomena cannot be explained by the classical center-surround receptive field and have been ascribed to a variety of mechanisms, including feedback from cortex. We asked whether these phenomena might all be explained by a single mechanism, contrast gain control, which is inherited from retina and possibly strengthened in thalamus. We formalized an intuitive model of retinal contrast gain control that explicitly predicts gain as a function of local contrast. In the model, the output of the receptive field is divided by the output of a suppressive field, which computes the local root-mean-square contrast. The model provides good fits to LGN responses to a variety of stimuli; with a single set of parameters, it captures saturation, size tuning, and masking. It also correctly predicts that responses to small stimuli grow proportionally with contrast: were it not for the suppressive field, LGN responses would be linear. We characterized the suppressive field and found that it is similar in size to the surround of the classical receptive field (which is eight times larger than commonly estimated), it is not selective for stimulus orientation, and it responds to a wide range of frequencies, including very low spatial frequencies and high temporal frequencies. The latter property is hardly consistent with feedback from cortex. These measurements thoroughly describe the visual properties of contrast gain control in LGN and provide a parsimonious explanation for disparate suppressive phenomena.},

abstract = {In the early visual system, a contrast gain control mechanism sets the gain of responses based on the locally prevalent contrast. The measure of contrast used by this adaptation mechanism is commonly assumed to be the standard deviation of light intensities relative to the mean (root-mean-square contrast). A number of alternatives, however, are possible. For example, the measure of contrast might depend on the absolute deviations relative to the mean, or on the prevalence of the darkest or lightest intensities. We investigated the statistical computation underlying this measure of contrast in the cat’s lateral geniculate nucleus, which relays signals from retina to cortex. Borrowing a method from psychophysics, we recorded responses to white noise stimuli whose distribution of intensities was precisely varied. We varied the standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the distribution of intensities while keeping the mean luminance constant. We found that gain strongly depends on the standard deviation of the distribution. At constant standard deviation, moreover, gain is invariant to changes in skewness or kurtosis. These findings held for both ON and OFF cells, indicating that the measure of contrast is independent of the range of stimulus intensities signaled by the cells. These results confirm the long-held assumption that contrast gain control computes root-mean-square contrast. They also show that contrast gain control senses the full distribution of intensities and leaves unvaried the relative responses of the different cell types. The advantages to visual processing of this remarkably specific computation are not entirely known.},

This, together with response nonlinearities and variability, was just sufficient to provide an ideal observer with uniform contrast sensitivity across the retina for both threshold and suprathreshold stimuli. We hypothesized that overlap might maximize the information represented from natural images, thereby optimizing retinal performance for many tasks. Indeed, tested with natural images (which contain statistical correlations), a model ganglion cell array maximized information represented in its population responses with 2 spacing, i.e., the overlap observed in the retina. Yet, tested with white noise (which lacks statistical correlations), an array maximized its information by minimizing overlap. In both cases, optimal overlap balanced greater signal-to-noise ratio (from larger receptive fields) against greater redundancy (because of larger receptive field overlap). Thus, dendritic overlap improves vision by taking optimal advantage of the statistical correlations of natural scenes.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex exhibit several nonlinearities in their responses to visual stimuli, including response decrements to repeated stimuli, contrast-dependent phase advance, contrast saturation, and cross-orientation suppression. Thalamocortical synaptic depression has been implicated in these phenomena but has not been examined directly in visual cortex in vivo. We assessed depression of visual thalamocortical synapses in vivo using 20-100 Hz trains of electrical stimuli delivered to the LGN. Cortical cells receiving direct input from the LGN, identified by short latency and low jitter of LGN-evoked PSPs, showed moderate reductions in PSP amplitude during the fastest trains. Cells receiving indirect input from the thalamus via other cortical excitatory neurons show a marked reduction in PSP amplitude during a train, which could be explained either by synaptic depression in corticocortical synapses or by an inhibition-mediated suppression of the firing of their afferents. Reducing spontaneous activity in the LGN (by retinal blockade) unmasked additional depression at the thalamocortical synapse but only for the first stimulus in the train. That is, the first PSP was increased in amplitude relative to the unblocked condition, but subsequent responses were essentially unchanged. Thus, the synapses are maintained at significant levels of depression by spontaneous activity. These findings constrain the role that thalamocortical depression can play in shaping cortical responses to visual stimuli.},

Both types of cell are here further described. Their cone connections are quantified and compared with those of mammals and other vertebrates. The dendrites and axons of the H2 type of cell contact only cones as do the dendrites of the H1 cell (originally described by Polyak (1941)) which has an axon contacting only rods. The dendrites of foveal H2 cells contact between 11 and 14 cones; those of H1 contact 7. The number of cones that each type of cell contacts increases with increasing distance from the fovea, so that, by 5-6 mm eccentricity, H2-type cells synapse with between 20 and 30 cones, and the H1 cells with 12-15. The qualitatively estimated coverage factors of each are 3 or 4; every cone synapses with more than one of both types. Neither type of horizontal cell makes chromatically specific connections that are anatomically recognizable, unlike the situation in some teleostean and turtle retinae. Individual horizontal cells, particularly those connected to foveal cones, may have different ratios of chromatic input. At equivalent eccentricities, up to about 6 mm from the fovea, the dendritic fields of H2 horizontal cells are about twice the size of H1 cells and contact about twice the number of cones. These relative differences are closely similar to those of the cat’s horizontal cells and it is suggested that they are a basic feature of most placental mammals. The organization of foveal cone fibres within Henle’s layer is described. The distribution of primate cone telodendria, gap junctions and synapses in the outer plexiform layer are briefly reviewed and compared with those of other vertebrate retinae.},

In addition to demonstrating that TMS can be successfully used to induce blindsight within a normal population, these results suggest a functioning geniculoextrastriate visual pathway that bypasses V1 and can process orientation and color in the absence of conscious awareness.},

We are typically aware of only either the most salient parts of a visual scene or the parts that we are actively paying attention to. Recent research on visual neurons in monkeys is beginning to show how the brain both selects and discards incoming visual information. For example, what happens to the responses of visual neurons when attention is directed to one element, such as an oriented colored bar, embedded among an array of other oriented bars? Some of this research shows that attention to the oriented bar restricts the receptive field of visual neurons down to this single element. However, other research shows that attention to this single element affects the responses of neurons with receptive fields throughout the visual field. In this review, these two seemingly contradictory results are shown to actually be mutually consistent. A simple computational model is described that explains these results, and also provides a framework for predicting a variety of additional neurophysiological, neuroimaging and behavioral studies of attention.},

We have estimated the minimum differences in stimulus orientation and spatial frequency that can produce reliable changes in the responses of individual neurons in cat visual cortex. We compare these values with orientation and spatial frequency discrimination thresholds determined behaviorally. Slopes of the tuning functions and response variability determine the minimum orientation and spatial frequency differences that can elicit a reliable response change. These minimum values were obtained from single cells using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The average minimum orientation and spatial frequency differences that could be signaled reliably by cells from our sample were 6.4 degrees (n = 22) and 21.3% (n = 18), respectively. These values are approximately 0.20 of the average full tuning width at one-half height of the cells. Although these average values are well above the behaviorally determined thresholds, the most selective cells signaled orientation and frequency differences of 1.84 degrees and 5.25%, respectively. These values are of the same order of magnitude as the behavioral thresholds. We show that, because of slow fluctuations in a cell’s responsivity, ROC analysis overestimates response variability. We estimate that these slow response fluctuations elevated our estimates of single cell “thresholds” by, on average, 30%. Our data point to an approximate correspondence between orientation and spatial frequency discrimination “thresholds” determined behaviorally and those estimated from the most selective single cortical cells. Interpretation of this quantitative correspondence is considered in the discussion.},

To provide useful perceptual representations, the brain must go beyond the measurements and make inferences about the scene being viewed. This arti- cle considers the first stages of spatiochromatic vision. We show how spatial and chromatic information become intertwined by the optics of the eye and because of the structure of the retinal cone mosaic, and we consider the consequent implications for perception. Because there is at most one cone at each retinal location, the standard treatment of human trichromacy does not apply at fine spatial scales. Rather, trichromacy results from a perceptual inference based on measurements from cones of different classes at different locations. Our treatment emphasizes linking physics, biology, and compu- tation with the goal of providing a framework for a larger understanding of how the brain interprets photoreceptor excitations to see objects and their properties.},

For more than 25 years, the techniques of action spectroscopy have yielded insights into the wavelength sensitivity of circadian input in humans and other mammalian species. The seminal discovery of melanopsin, the photopigment in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells, has provided a significant turning point for understanding human circadian phototransduction. Action spectra in humans show that the peak wavelength sensitivity for this newly discovered sensory system is within the blue portion of the spectrum. This is fundamentally different from the three-cone photopic visual system, as well as the individual rod and cone photoreceptor peaks. Studies on rodents, nonhuman primates, and humans indicate that despite having a different wavelength fingerprint, these classic visual photoreceptors still provide an element of input to the circadian system. These findings open the door to innovations in light therapy for circadian and affective disorders, as well as possible architectural light applications.},

Here we have used two-photon glutamate uncaging and compartmental modeling to reveal a gradient of nonlinear synaptic integration in basal and apical oblique dendrites of cortical pyramidal neurons. Excitatory inputs to the proximal dendrite sum linearly and require precise temporal coincidence for effective summation, whereas distal inputs are amplified with high gain and integrated over broader time windows. This allows distal inputs to overcome their electrotonic disadvantage, and become surprisingly more effective than proximal inputs at influencing action potential output. Thus, single dendritic branches can already exhibit nonuniform synaptic integration, with the computational strategy shifting from temporal coding to rate coding along the dendrite.},

Although in prior proposals, the dorsal and ventral pathways support non-conscious and conscious vision, respectively, recent modelling and empirical developments indicate that each pathway plays important roles in both non-conscious and conscious vision. In these models, the ventral P-pathway consists of one subpathway processing an object’s contour features, e.g. curvature, the other processing its surface attributes, e.g. colour. Masked priming studies have shown that feed-forward activity in the ventral P-pathway on its own supports non-conscious processing of contour and surface features. The dorsal M-pathway activity contributes directly to conscious vision of motion and indirectly to object vision by projecting to prefrontal cortex, which in turn injects top-down neural activity into the ventral P-pathway and there ‘ignites’ feed-forward–re-entrant loops deemed necessary for conscious vision. Moreover, an object’s shape or contour remains invisible without the prior conscious registration of its surface properties, which for that reason are taken to comprise fundamental visual qualia. Besides suggesting avenues for future research, these developments bear on several recent and past philosophical issues.},

In so doing, we identified a subclass of corticogeniculate neurons that receives direct, suprathreshold input from the LGN that is similar in latency to that directed to other recipient neurons (4.2 +/- 0.4 vs 4.0 +/- 0.2 ms). These neurons also provide feedback to the LGN that is significantly shorter in latency than that supplied by corticogeniculate neurons lacking LGN input (5.1 +/- 1.3 vs 11.1 +/- 2.3 ms, respectively). Across our sample of corticogeniculate neurons, the shortest combined visual response latency and feedback latency was 37 ms (mean, 52.5 +/- 3.8 ms), indicating that visual signals can rapidly travel from the periphery to the cortex and back to the LGN.},

abstract = {Most neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) are selective for stimulus size, a property with important implications for salient feature detection. Size selectivity involves dynamic interactions between neuronal circuits that establish the classical (center) and extraclassical (surround) of a neuron’s receptive field. Although much is known about the tuning properties and stimulus selectivity of the center and surround subunits, relatively little is known about how these subunits interact to achieve size selectivity. To address this question, we examined the temporal dynamics of size selectivity in two classes of pyramidal neurons at similar hierarchical processing stages in V1 of alert monkeys. These two classes were comprised of neurons in cortical layer 6 with identified projections to the lateral geniculate nucleus. While both neuronal groups displayed comparable levels of size selectivity, the temporal dynamics of their tuning differed significantly. We compared the size tuning profiles of each cell type with a series of sum-of-Gaussian models and discovered that the receptive fields of neurons with fast-conducting axons contained an excitatory center and a suppressive surround with similar onset timing. In contrast, neurons with slow-conducting axons used two center components-an early wide-field component and a delayed narrow-field component that increased activity-in addition to the surround component. The early, wide-field component represents a novel mechanism for cortical neurons to integrate contextual information. These results demonstrate that size tuning in cortical neurons is established via multiple unique mechanisms, dictated by the rich circuit architecture in which neurons are embedded.},

Subsequently, information about specific multipart configurations emerged, building gradually over the course of approximately 60 ms, producing a sparser and more explicit representation of object shape. We show that this gradual transformation can be explained by a recurrent network process that effectively compares parts signals across neurons to generate inferences about multipart shape configurations.},

DC-capable amplifiers, sampling at 32kHz per channel with 18-bits of A/D resolution are capable of resolving extracellular voltages spanning single-neuron action potentials, high frequency oscillations, and high amplitude ultra-slow activity, but this approach generates 3 terabytes of data per day (at 4 bytes per sample) using current data formats.

abstract = {Blinks profoundly interrupt visual input but are rarely noticed, perhaps because of blink suppression, a visual-sensitivity loss that begins immediately prior to blink onset. Blink suppression is thought to result from an extra-retinal signal that is associated with the blink motor command and may act to attenuate the sensory consequences of the motor action. However, the neural mechanisms underlying this phenomenon remain unclear. They are challenging to study because any brain-activity changes resulting from an extra-retinal signal associated with the blink motor command are potentially masked by profound neural-activity changes caused by the retinal-illumination reduction that results from occlusion of the pupil by the eyelid. Here, we distinguished direct top-down effects of blink-associated motor signals on cortical activity from purely mechanical or optical effects of blinking on visual input by combining pupil-independent retinal stimulation with functional MRI (fMRI) in humans. Even though retinal illumination was kept constant during blinks, we found that blinking nevertheless suppressed activity in visual cortex and in areas of parietal and prefrontal cortex previously associated with awareness of environmental change. Our findings demonstrate active top-down modulation of visual processing during blinking, suggesting a possible mechanism by which blinks go unnoticed.},

abstract = {Receptive fields (RFs) of cells in the middle temporal area (MT or V5) of monkeys will often encompass multiple objects under normal image viewing. We therefore have studied how multiple moving stimuli interact when presented within and near the RF of single MT cells. We used moving Gabor function stimuli, <1 degrees in spatial extent and approximately 100 msec in duration, presented on a grid of possible locations over the RF of the cell. Responses to these stimuli were typically robust, and their small spatial and temporal extent allowed detailed mapping of RFs and of interactions between stimuli. The responses to pairs of such stimuli were compared against the responses to the same stimuli presented singly. The responses were substantially less than the sum of the responses to the component stimuli and were well described by a power-law summation model with divisive inhibition. Such divisive inhibition is a key component of recently proposed “normalization” models of cortical physiology and is presumed to arise from lateral interconnections within a region. One open question is whether the normalization occurs only once in primary visual cortex or multiple times in different cortical areas. We addressed this question by exploring the spatial extent over which one stimulus would divide the response to another and found effective normalization from stimuli quite far removed from the RF center. This supports models under which normalization occurs both in MT and in earlier stages.},

We have measured the responses of neurons in area MT of the alert monkey while we varied the strength and direction of the motion signal in such displays. The strength of motion is controlled by the proportion of spatiotemporally correlated dots, which we term the correlation of the stimulus. For many MT cells, responses varied approximately linearly with stimulus correlation. When they occurred, nonlinearities were equally likely to be either positively or negatively accelerated. We also explored the relationship between response magnitude and response variance for these cells and found, in general agreement with other investigators, that this relationship conforms to a power law with an exponent slightly greater than 1. The variance of the cells’ discharge is little influenced by the trial-to-trial fluctuations inherent in our stochastic display, and is therefore likely to be of neural origin. Linear responses to these stochastic motion stimuli are predicted by simple, low- level motion models incorporating sensors having relatively broad spatial and temporal frequency tuning. AUTHOR},

A model of two lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) cells, which interact only through slow (tens of seconds) covariations in their resting membrane potentials, is used here to investigate the effect of such covariations on cross-correlograms taken during stimulus-driven conditions. Despite the slow timescale of the interactions, the model generates cross-correlograms with peak widths in the range of 25-200 ms. These bear a striking resemblance to those reported in studies of LGN cells by Sillito et al., which were taken at the time as evidence of a fast spike timing synchronization interaction; the model highlights the possibility that those correlogram peaks may have been caused by a mechanism other than spike synchronization. Slow resting potential covariations are suggested instead as the dominant generating mechanism. How can a slow interaction generate covariogram peaks with a width 100-1,000 times thinner than its timescale? Broad peaks caused by slow interactions are modulated by the cells’ poststimulus time histograms (PSTHs). When the PSTHs have thin peaks (e.g., tens of milliseconds), the cross-correlogram peaks generated by slow interactions will also be thin; such peaks are easily misinterpretable as being caused by fast interactions. Although this point is explored here in the context of LGN recordings, it is a general point and applies elsewhere. When cross-correlogram peak widths are of the same order of magnitude as PSTH peak widths, experiments designed to reveal short-timescale interactions must be interpreted with the issue of possible contributions from slower interactions in mind Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

The other is a method to determine whether the covariogram could potentially have been caused by latency covariations.},

abstract = {Figure-ground organization involves the assignment of edges to a figural shape on one or the other side of each dividing edge. Established visual cues for edge assignment primarily concern relatively local rather than contextual factors. In the present article, we show that an assignment for a locally unbiased edge can be affected by an assignment of a remote contextual edge that has its own locally biased assignment. We find that such propagation of edge assignment from the biased remote context occurs only when the biased and unbiased edges are grouped. This new principle, whereby grouping constrains the propagation of figural edge assignment, emerges from both subjective reports and an objective short-term edge-matching task. It generalizes from moving displays involving grouping by common fate and collinearity, to static displays with grouping by similarity of edge-contrast polarity, or apparent occlusion. Our results identify a new contextual influence on edge assignment. They also identify a new mechanistic relation between grouping and figure-ground processes, whereby grouping between remote elements can constrain the propagation of edge assignment between those elements.

abstract = {Cross-orientation suppression was measured in human primary visual cortex (V1) to test the normalization model. Subjects viewed vertical target gratings (of varying contrasts) with or without a superimposed horizontal mask grating (fixed contrast). We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure the activity in each of several hypothetical channels (corresponding to subpopulations of neurons) with different orientation tunings and fit these orientation-selective responses with the normalization model. For the V1 channel maximally tuned to the target orientation, responses increased with target contrast but were suppressed when the horizontal mask was added, evident as a shift in the contrast gain of this channel’s responses. For the channel maximally tuned to the mask orientation, a constant baseline response was evoked for all target contrasts when the mask was absent; responses decreased with increasing target contrast when the mask was present. The normalization model provided a good fit to the contrast-response functions with and without the mask. In a control experiment, the target and mask presentations were temporally interleaved, and we found no shift in contrast gain, i.e., no evidence for suppression. We conclude that the normalization model can explain cross-orientation suppression in human visual cortex. The approach adopted here can be applied broadly to infer, simultaneously, the responses of several subpopulations of neurons in the human brain that span particular stimulus or feature spaces, and characterize their interactions. In addition, it allows us to investigate how stimuli are represented by the inferred activity of entire neural populations.},

abstract = {Photoreception in the mammalian retina is not restricted to rods and cones but extends to a subset of retinal ganglion cells expressing the photopigment melanopsin (mRGCs). These mRGCs are known to drive such reflex light responses as circadian photoentrainment and pupillomotor movements. By contrast, until now there has been no direct assessment of their contribution to conventional visual pathways. Here, we address this deficit. Using new reporter lines, we show that mRGC projections are much more extensive than previously thought and extend across the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), origin of thalamo-cortical projection neurons. We continue to show that this input supports extensive physiological light responses in the dLGN and visual cortex in mice lacking rods+cones (a model of advanced retinal degeneration). Moreover, using chromatic stimuli to isolate melanopsin-derived responses in mice with an intact visual system, we reveal strong melanopsin input to the ∼40% of neurons in the LGN that show sustained activation to a light step. We demonstrate that this melanopsin input supports irradiance-dependent increases in the firing rate of these neurons. The implication that melanopsin is required to accurately encode stimulus irradiance is confirmed using melanopsin knockout mice. Our data establish melanopsin-based photoreception as a significant source of sensory input to the thalamo-cortical visual system, providing unique irradiance information and allowing visual responses to be retained even in the absence of rods+cones. These findings identify mRGCs as a potential origin for aspects of visual perception and indicate that they may support vision in people suffering retinal degeneration.},

Can the temporal structure of a stimulus interfere with, or even disrupt, the spatiotemporal structure of the neural representation? We investigated this potential confound in the locust olfactory system. When odors were presented in trains of nearly overlapping pulses, responses of first-order interneurons (projection neurons) changed reliably, and often markedly, with pulse position as responses to one pulse interfered with subsequent responses. However, using the responses of an ensemble of projection neurons, we could accurately classify the odorants as well as characterize the temporal properties of the stimulus. Further, we found that second-order follower neurons showed firing patterns consistent with the information in the projection-neuron ensemble. Thus, ensemble-based spatiotemporal coding could disambiguate complex and potentially confounding temporally structured sensory stimuli and thereby provide an invariant response to a stimulus presented in various ways.},

One measure of quality in evolutionary studies is the degree of bodily symmetry (fluctuating asymmetry, FA), because it measures developmental stability7, 8. Does dance quality reveal FA to the observer and is the effect stronger for male dancers than female? To answer these questions, we chose a population that has been measured twice for FA since 1996 (ref. 9) in a society (Jamaican) in which dancing is important in the lives of both sexes. Motion-capture cameras created controlled stimuli (in the form of videos) that isolated dance movements from all other aspects of visual appearance (including FA), and the same population evaluated these videos for dancing ability. Here we report that there are strong positive associations between symmetry and dancing ability, and these associations were stronger in men than in women. In addition, women rate dances by symmetrical men relatively more positively than do men, and more-symmetrical men value symmetry in women dancers more than do less-symmetrical men. In summary, dance in Jamaica seems to show evidence of sexual selection and to reveal important information about the dancer.},

This review focuses on the transmission of sensory information through the circuit linking thalamus and cortex, two distant brain regions. Strong feedforward inhibition in the thalamocortical circuit renders cortex highly sensitive to the thalamic synchrony evoked by a sensory stimulus. Neuromodulators and feedback connections may modulate the temporal sensitivity of such circuits and gate the propagation of synchrony into other layers and cortical areas. The prevalence of strong feedforward inhibitory circuits throughout the central nervous system suggests that synchrony codes and timing-sensitive circuits may be widespread, occurring well beyond sensory thalamus and cortex.},

However, evidence is emerging for a distributive system with modality-specific sensory components (Morrone et al., 2005; Johnston et al., 2006). Here we show that fast contrast adaptation, which can be observed in the retina, induces a change in apparent duration. The perceived duration of a subsecond interval containing a 50% luminance contrast drifting pattern is compressed when it follows a high (90%) as compared to a low (10%) contrast interval. The duration effect cannot be attributed to changes in latency at onset relative to offset, can be dissociated from the effect of contrast context on apparent speed or apparent contrast per se and it occurs in a retinocentric frame of reference. The temporal compression is limited to high drift temporal frequencies (‚â•10 Hz) and is not observed for equiluminant chromatic stimuli. This pattern of results indicates a major role for the magnocellular pathway in the neural encoding and representation of visual time.},

In rat somatosensory cortex, we measured in vivo the excitatory postsynaptic potential evoked by a single synaptic connection and found that thalamocortical synapses have low efficacy. Convergent inputs, however, are both numerous and synchronous, and intracortical amplification is not required. Our results suggest a mechanism of cortical activation by which thalamic input alone can drive cortex.},

abstract = {Corticothalamic feedback is believed to play an important role in selectively regulating the flow of sensory information from thalamus to cortex. But despite its importance, the size and nature of corticothalamic pathway connectivity is not fully understood. In light of recent empirical data, the aim of this paper was to quantify the contribution of area 17 axon connectivity to the synaptic organization of A-laminae in dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in cat, the best studied corticothalamic pathway. Numerical constraints indicate that most corticogeniculate synapses are not formed with inhibitory interneurons. However, the main finding is that there was an order of magnitude difference between estimates of the mean number of cortical synapses per A-laminae neuron based on individual corticogeniculate axon data (12,000–16,000 cortical synapses per cell) than that previously derived from partial reconstructions of the synaptic input to two physiologically identified relay cells (1200–1500 cortical synapses per cell). In an attempt to reconcile these different estimates, parameter variation and comparative analyses suggest that previous work may have overestimated the density of corticogeniculate efferent neurons and underestimated the total number of synapses per geniculate neuron. But as this analysis did not include area 18 corticogeniculate axons innervating A-laminae, the discrepancy between different estimates may be greater and require further explanation. Thus, the analysis presented here suggests geniculate neurons receive on average a greater number of cortical synapses per cell but from far fewer corticogeniculate axons than previously thought.},

abstract = {It is still a popular view that primary sensory cortices are unimodal, but recent physiological studies have shown that under certain behavioral conditions primary sensory cortices can also be activated by multiple other modalities. Here, we investigate the anatomical substrate, which may underlie multisensory processes at the level of the primary auditory cortex (field AI), and which may, in turn, enable AI to influence other sensory systems. We approached this issue by means of the axonal transport of the sensitive bidirectional neuronal tracer fluorescein-labeled dextran which was injected into AI of Mongolian gerbils (Meriones unguiculatus). Of the total number of retrogradely labeled cell bodies (i.e. cells of origin of direct projections to AI) found in non-auditory sensory and multisensory brain areas, approximately 40% were in cortical areas and 60% in subcortical structures. Of the cell bodies in the cortical areas about 82% were located in multisensory cortex, viz., the dorsoposterior and ventroposterior, posterior parietal cortex, the claustrum, and the endopiriform nucleus, 10% were located in the primary somatosensory cortex (hindlimb and trunk region), and 8% in secondary visual cortex. The cortical regions with retrogradely labeled cells also contained anterogradely labeled axons and their terminations, i.e. they are also target areas of direct projections from AI. In addition, the primary olfactory cortex was identified as a target area of projections from AI. The laminar pattern of corticocortical connections suggests that AI receives primarily cortical feedback-type inputs and projects in a feedforward manner to its target areas. Of the labeled cell bodies in the subcortical structures, approximately 90% were located in multisensory thalamic, 4% in visual thalamic, and 6% in multisensory lower brainstem structures. At subcortical levels, we observed a similar correspondence of retrogradely labeled cells and anterogradely labeled axons and terminals in visual (posterior limitans thalamic nucleus) and multisensory thalamic nuclei (dorsal and medial division of the medial geniculate body, suprageniculate nucleus, posterior thalamic cell group, zona incerta), and in the multisensory nucleus of the brachium of the inferior colliculus. Retrograde, but not anterograde, labeling was found in the multisensory pontine reticular formation, particularly in the reticulotegmental nucleus of the pons. Conversely, anterograde, but no retrograde, labeling was found in the visual laterodorsal and lateroposterior thalamic nuclei, in the multisensory peripeduncular, posterior intralaminar, and reticular thalamic nuclei, as well as in the multisensory superior and pericentral inferior colliculi (including cuneiform and sagulum nucleus), pontine nuclei, and periaqueductal gray. Our study supports the notion that AI is not merely involved in the analysis of auditory stimulus properties but also in processing of other sensory and multisensory information. Since AI is directly connected to other primary sensory cortices (viz. the somatosensory and olfactory ones) multisensory information is probably also processed in these cortices. This suggests more generally, that primary sensory cortices may not be unimodal.},

abstract = {Recent analysis of evoked activity recorded across different brain regions and tasks revealed a marked decrease in noise correlations and trial-by-trial variability. Given the importance of correlations and variability for information processing within the rate coding paradigm, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the reduction in these quantities despite an increase in firing rates. These models suggest that anatomical clusters and/or tightly balanced excitation-inhibition can generate intrinsic network dynamics that may exhibit a reduction in noise correlations and trial-by-trial variability when perturbed by an external input. Such mechanisms based on the recurrent feedback crucially ignore the contribution of feedforward input to the statistics of the evoked activity. Therefore, we investigated how statistical properties of the feedforward input shape the statistics of the evoked activity. Specifically, we focused on the effect of input correlation structure on the noise correlations and trial-by-trial variability. We show that the ability of neurons to transfer the input firing rate, correlation, and variability to the output depends on the correlations within the presynaptic pool of a neuron, and that an input with even weak within-correlations can be sufficient to reduce noise correlations and trial-by-trial variability, without requiring any specific recurrent connectivity structure. In general, depending on the ongoing activity state, feedforward input could either increase or decrease noise correlation and trial-by-trial variability. Thus, we propose that evoked activity statistics are jointly determined by the feedforward and feedback inputs.},

This conclusion was principally based on the observation in area V3 neurons that inactivating MT by cooling led to a severe weakening of the center response and of the center-surround interactions, and that these effects were particularly strong for low salience stimuli. In the present paper, we first show that the results extend to areas V1 and V2. In particular, the inhibitory center-surround interactions in areas V1, V2 and V3 disappear almost completely in the absence of feedback input from MT for low salience stimuli, whereas the effects are much more limited for stimuli of middle and high salience. We then compare the results obtained in studies of feedback connections from MT to those obtained in a study of the feedback action of area V2 onto V1 neurons [Hupé et al. (2001) J. Neurophysiol., 85: 146-163], in which the same effects were observed on the center mechanism (decrease in response), but no effects were seen on the center-surround interactions. We conclude that feedback connections act in a non-linear fashion to boost the gain of the center mechanism and that they combine with horizontal connections to generate the center-surround interactions.},

abstract = {Successful recognition and manipulation of objects in one’s visual environment is critically dependent upon the ability to recover three-dimensional (3D) surface geometry from two-dimensional (2D) retinal images. The relative motion of image features, caused by relative displacement of object and observer, has characteristic properties that betray components of the 3D source geometry (distance, tilt, slant and curvature) and is among the most valuable sources of information used for 3D surface recovery by the primate visual system. We have considered the behavior of motion- sensitive neurons in primate visual cortex and found that their properties closely resemble those of differential motion operators that can be used to formally characterize the 3D shape of a smooth moving surface, Our analysis has led us to identify a set of three orders of filters for differential motion detection, These filters behave in a manner that is strikingly similar to the spatial and velocity tuning profiles of a sub-population of neurons-those possessing antagonistic motion surrounds-in the middle temporal visual area (MT), On the basis of this analysis, we suggest that MT neurons subserve 3D surface recovery from relative motion cues},

The most salient characteristic of this sensory stream is the rich temporal structure that is caused by changes in the environment and self motion of sensors (for example, rapid eye or whisker movements). In recent years, substantial progress has been made in understanding how such rapidly varying stimuli are represented in the responses of sensory neurons of a large variety of sensory systems. The crucial observation that has emerged from these studies is that individual action potentials convey substantial amounts of information, which permits the discrimination of rapidly varying stimuli with high temporal precision Type: Journal Article Type: Review Type: Review, Tutorial Language: eng},

An additive model, rather than a multiplicative or contrast-gain model best describes the attentional modulations in V1.

The responses to both stimulus ensembles were well described as rate-modulated Poisson processes but with very high precision (approximately 3 ms) modulation functions underlying the time-varying responses. Information-theoretic analysis revealed that the responses encoded only approximately 1 bit/s about constant-velocity stimuli but up to 29 bits/s about the time-varying stimuli. Analysis of local field potentials revealed that part of the residual response variability arose from “noise” sources extrinsic to the neuron. Our results demonstrate that extrastriate neurons in alert primates can encode the fine temporal structure of visual stimuli.},

Here, we present neural evidence in the frontal eye fields (FEF) for serial, covert shifts of attention during search but not pop-out. Furthermore, attention shifts reflected in FEF spiking activity were correlated with 18-34 Hz oscillations in the local field potential, suggesting a “clocking” signal. This provides direct neural evidence that primates can spontaneously adopt a serial search strategy and that these serial covert shifts of attention are directed by the FEF. It also suggests that neuron population oscillations may regulate the timing of cognitive processing.},

abstract = {Dynamically shifting attention between behaviorally relevant stimuli in the environment is a key condition for successful adaptive behavior. Here, we investigated how exogenous (reflexive) and endogenous (voluntary) shifts of visual spatial attention interact to modulate activity of single neurons in extrastriate area MT. We used a double-cueing paradigm, in which the first cue instructed two macaque monkeys to covertly attend to one of three moving random dot patterns until a second cue, whose unpredictable onset exogenously captured attention, either signaled to shift or maintain the current focus of attention. The neuronal activity revealed correlates of both exogenous and endogenous attention, which could be well distinguished by their characteristic temporal dynamics. The earliest effect was a transient interruption of the focus of endogenous attention by the onset of the second cue. The neuronal signature of this exogenous capture of attention was a short-latency decrease of responses to the stimulus attended so far. About 70 ms later, the influence of exogenous attention leveled off, which was reflected in two concurrent processes: responses to the newly cued stimulus continuously increased because of allocation of endogenous attention, while, surprisingly, there was also a gradual rebound of attentional enhancement of the previously relevant stimulus. Only after an additional 110 ms did endogenous disengagement of attention from this previously relevant stimulus become evident. These patterns of attentional modulation can be most parsimoniously explained by assuming two distinct attentional mechanisms drawing on the same capacity-limited system, with exogenous attention having a much faster time course than endogenous attention.},

abstract = {Neuronal responses to second-order motion, that is, to spatiotemporal variations of texture or contrast, have been reported in several cortical areas of mammals, including the middle-temporal (MT) area in primates. In this study, we investigated whether second-order responses are present in the cat posteromedial lateral suprasylvian (PMLS) cortex, a possible homolog of the primate area MT. The stimuli used were luminance-based sine-wave gratings (first-order) and contrast-modulated carrier stimuli (second-order), which consisted of a high-spatial-frequency static grating (carrier) whose contrast was modulated by a low-spatial-frequency drifting grating (envelope). Results indicate that most PMLS neurons responded to second-order motion and for the vast majority of cells, first- and second-order preferred directions were conserved. However, responses to second-order stimuli were significantly reduced when compared to those evoked by first-order gratings. Circular variance was increased for second-order stimuli, indicating that PMLS direction selectivity was weaker for this type of stimulus. Finally, carrier orientation selectivity was either absent or very broad and had no influence on the envelope’s orientation selectivity. In conclusion, our data show that PMLS neurons exhibit similar first- and second-order response profiles and that, akin primate area MT cells, they perform a form-cue invariant analysis of motion signals.},

In this article, we describe the basic science presentation and the breakout group discussion on the topic of perception from the first CNTRICS meeting, held in Bethesda, Maryland on February 26 and 27, 2007. The importance of perceptual dysfunction in schizophrenia, the nature of perceptual abnormalities in this disorder, and the critical need to develop perceptual tests appropriate for future clinical trials were discussed. Although deficits are also seen in auditory, olfactory, and somatosensory processing in schizophrenia, the first CNTRICS meeting focused on visual processing deficits. Key concepts of gain control and integration in visual perception were introduced. Definitions and examples of these concepts are provided in this article. Use of visual gain control and integration fit a number of the criteria suggested by the CNTRICS committee, provide fundamental constructs for understanding the visual system in schizophrenia, and are inclusive of both lower-level and higher-level perceptual deficits.},

abstract = {Visual processing deficits are an integral component of schizophrenia and are sensitive predictors of schizophrenic decompensation in healthy adults. The primate visual system consists of discrete subcortical magnocellular and parvocellular pathways, which project preferentially to dorsal and ventral cortical streams. Subcortical systems show differential stimulus sensitivity, while cortical systems, in turn, can be differentiated using surface potential analysis. The present study examined contributions of subcortical dysfunction to cortical processing deficits using high-density event-related potentials. Event-related potentials were recorded to stimuli biased towards the magnocellular system using low-contrast isolated checks in Experiment 1 and towards the magnocellular or parvocellular system using low versus high spatial frequency (HSF) sinusoidal gratings, respectively, in Experiment 2. The sample consisted of 23 patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and 19 non-psychiatric volunteers of similar age. In Experiment 1, a large decrease in the P1 component of the visual event-related potential in response to magnocellular-biased isolated check stimuli was seen in patients compared with controls (F = 13.2, P = 0.001). Patients also showed decreased slope of the contrast response function over the magnocellular-selective contrast range compared with controls (t = 9.2, P = 0.04) indicating decreased signal amplification. In Experiment 2, C1 (F = 8.5, P = 0.007), P1 (F = 33.1, P < 0.001) and N1 (F = 60.8, P < 0.001) were reduced in amplitude to magnocellular-biased low spatial frequency (LSF) stimuli in patients with schizophrenia, but were intact to parvocellular-biased HSF stimuli, regardless of generator location. Source waveforms derived from inverse dipole modelling showed reduced P1 in Experiment 1 and reduced C1, P1 and N1 to LSF stimuli in Experiment 2, consistent with surface waveforms. These results indicate pervasive magnocellular dysfunction at the subcortical level that leads to secondary impairment in activation of cortical visual structures within dorsal and ventral stream visual pathways. Our finding of early visual dysfunction is consistent with and explanatory of classic literature showing subjective complaints of visual distortions and is consistent with early visual processing deficits reported in schizophrenia. Although deficits in visual processing have frequently been construed as resulting from failures of top-down processing, the present findings argue strongly for bottom-up rather than top-down dysfunction at least within the early visual pathway. Deficits in magnocellular processing in this task may reflect more general impairments in neuronal systems functioning, such as deficits in non-linear amplification and may thus represent an organizing principle for predicting neurocognitive dysfunction in schizophrenia.},

Although the traditional view posits that noise degrades system performance, recent evidence suggests that noise may instead enhance neural information processing under certain conditions. Here we report that random channel and synaptic noise improve the ability of a biologically realistic computational model of the Hermissenda eye to encode light intensity. The model was created in GENESIS and is based on a previous model used to examine effects of changes in type B photoreceptor excitability, synaptic strength, and network architecture. The network consists of two type A and three type B multicompartmental photoreceptors. Each compartment contains a population of Hodgkin-Huxley-type ion channels and each cell is stimulated via artificial light currents. We found that the addition of random channel and synaptic noise yielded a significant improvement in the accuracy of the network’s encoding of light intensity across eight light levels spanning 3.5 log units (P<0.001, modified Levene test). The benefits of noise remained after controlling for several consequences of randomness in the model. Additionally, improvements were not confined to perithreshold stimulus intensities. Finally, the effects of noise are not present in individual neurons, but rather are an emergent property of the synaptically connected network that is independent of stochastic resonance. These results suggest that noise plays a constructive role in neural information processing, a concept that could have important implications for understanding neural information processing or designing neural interface devices.},

Using a nonlinear modeling framework applied to extracellular data, we demonstrate that the precise timing of thalamic spike trains can be explained by the interplay between an excitatory input and a delayed suppressive input that resembles inhibition, such that neuronal responses only occur in brief windows where excitation exceeds suppression. The resulting description of thalamic computation resembles earlier models of contrast adaptation, suggesting a more general role for mechanisms of contrast adaptation in visual processing. Thus, we describe a more complex computation underlying thalamic responses to artificial and natural stimuli that has implications for understanding how visual information is represented in the early stages of visual processing.},

The existence of such precision contributes to a fundamental debate over the basis of the neural code and, specifically, what timescales are important for neural computation. Using recordings in the lateral geniculate nucleus, here we demonstrate that the relevant timescale of neuronal spike trains depends on the frequency content of the visual stimulus, and that ‘relative’, not absolute, precision is maintained both during spatially uniform white-noise visual stimuli and naturalistic movies. Using information-theoretic techniques, we demonstrate a clear role of relative precision, and show that the experimentally observed temporal structure in the neuronal response is necessary to represent accurately the more slowly changing visual world. By establishing a functional role of precision, we link visual neuron function on slow timescales to temporal structure in the response at faster timescales, and uncover a straightforward purpose of fine-timescale features of neuronal spike trains.},

abstract = {Excitatory lateral connections within the primary visual cortex are thought to link neurons with similar receptive field properties. Here we studied whether this rule can predict the distribution of excitatory connections in relation to cortical location and orientation preference in the cat visual cortex. To this end, we obtained orientation maps of areas 17 or 18 using optical imaging and injected anatomical tracers into these regions. The distribution of labeled axonal boutons originating from large populations of excitatory neurons was then analyzed and compared with that of individual pyramidal or spiny stellate cells. We demonstrate that the connection patterns of populations of nearby neurons can be reasonably predicted by Gaussian and von Mises distributions as a function of cortical location and orientation, respectively. The connections were best described by superposition of two components: a spatially extended, orientation-specific and a local, orientation-invariant component. We then fitted the same model to the connections of single cells. The composite pattern of nine excitatory neurons (obtained from seven different animals) was consistent with the assumptions of the model. However, model fits to single cell axonal connections were often poorer and their estimated spatial and orientation tuning functions were highly variable. We conclude that the intrinsic excitatory network is biased to similar cortical locations and orientations but it is composed of neurons showing significant deviations from the population connectivity rule.},

abstract = {The primate visual system achieves remarkable visual object recognition performance even in brief presentations, and under changes to object exemplar, geometric transformations, and background variation (a.k.a. core visual object recognition). This remarkable performance is mediated by the representation formed in inferior temporal (IT) cortex. In parallel, recent advances in machine learning have led to ever higher performing models of object recognition using artificial deep neural networks (DNNs). It remains unclear, however, whether the representational performance of DNNs rivals that of the brain. To accurately produce such a comparison, a major difficulty has been a unifying metric that accounts for experimental limitations, such as the amount of noise, the number of neural recording sites, and the number of trials, and computational limitations, such as the complexity of the decoding classifier and the number of classifier training examples. In this work, we perform a direct comparison that corrects for these experimental limitations and computational considerations. As part of our methodology, we propose an extension of “kernel analysis” that measures the generalization accuracy as a function of representational complexity. Our evaluations show that, unlike previous bio-inspired models, the latest DNNs rival the representational performance of IT cortex on this visual object recognition task. Furthermore, we show that models that perform well on measures of representational performance also perform well on measures of representational similarity to IT, and on measures of predicting individual IT multi-unit responses. Whether these DNNs rely on computational mechanisms similar to the primate visual system is yet to be determined, but, unlike all previous bio-inspired models, that possibility cannot be ruled out merely on representational performance grounds.},

Such theoretical predictions have rarely been tested experimentally because of a scarcity of preparations that permit measurement of both the covariation of a neuron‚Äôs input signals and the effect on a cell‚Äôs output of manipulating such covariation. Here we introduce a method to measure covariation of the excitatory and inhibitory inputs a cell receives. This method revealed strong correlated noise in the inputs to two types of retinal ganglion cell. Eliminating correlated noise without changing other input properties substantially decreased the accuracy with which a cell‚Äôs spike outputs encoded light inputs. Thus, covariation of excitatory and inhibitory inputs can be a critical determinant of the reliability of neural coding and computation.},

In particular, the point process - generalized linear model (PP-GLM) framework has been applied successfully to problems ranging from neuro-endocrine physiology to neural decoding. However, the lack of freely distributed software implementations of published PP-GLM algorithms together with problem-specific modifications required for their use, limit wide application of these techniques. In an effort to make existing PP-GLM methods more accessible to the neuroscience community, we have developed nSTAT--an open source neural spike train analysis toolbox for Matlab(R). By adopting an object-oriented programming (OOP) approach, nSTAT allows users to easily manipulate data by performing operations on objects that have an intuitive connection to the experiment (spike trains, covariates, etc.), rather than by dealing with data in vector/matrix form. The algorithms implemented within nSTAT address a number of common problems including computation of peri-stimulus time histograms, quantification of the temporal response properties of neurons, and characterization of neural plasticity within and across trials. nSTAT provides a starting point for exploratory data analysis, allows for simple and systematic building and testing of point process models, and for decoding of stimulus variables based on point process models of neural function. By providing an open-source toolbox, we hope to establish a platform that can be easily used, modified, and extended by the scientific community to address limitations of current techniques and to extend available techniques to more complex problems.},

This circuitry is described here in the context of a two-level model that distinguishes between feedforward and feedback connections. Embedded within this basic framework is a more complex organization. Within the strictly feedforward pathway, these circuits distribute unique combinations of magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to neurons in layers 2-4B. Their input is dependent on the extrastriate cortical areas they target. The local feedback connections from deep layers (5 and 6) arise from a diverse population of pyramidal neurons. Each type forms local connections with a unique relationship to more superficial layers. In the case of layer 6 neurons, these connections are closely related to layer 4 subdivisions receiving input from different functional streams.},

Neverthelss, the available functional and anatomical evidence linking together specific cell types across these structures is surprisingly indirect. This review evaluates the available evidence and assesses the strength of the many inferences that can be made from these observations. There is strong evidence that parasol RGCs are the provenance of the magnocellular (M) visual pathway and that midget RGCs give rise to the parvocellular (P) pathway. Furthermore, the M and P pathways remain segregated up to the input layer of primary visual cortex. The relationships between the numerous other RGC types and cell types in the LGN remain less certain. and there remains ambiguity about how best to define additional pathways, such as the koniocellular (K) pathway, which probably arise from these other, less common, RGC types.},

year = {2013}, 
abstract = {Subjective experience often accompanies perception and cognition. This elusive feeling is difficult to characterize, both theoretically and experimentally. Perceptual subjective experience is at the heart of a theoretical debate in consciousness research: does it correspond to a genuine psychological and biological process independent from cognitive abilities, or is it a cognitive illusion, a post-hoc construct, implying that perceptual consciousness can be reduced to a sum of cognitive functions? We reconsider this debate in the light of known properties of the visual system, derived from studies on visual object and scene recognition but not specifically targeting consciousness issues. We propose here that initial visual subjective experience is characterized by two key properties, coarseness and vividness: initial subjective experience is integrated, meaningful, but does not contain detailed information. Subjective experience is likely to arise first in high-level visual areas, in which information is encoded in a coarse and integrated manner. We propose that initial subjective experience is related to the concept of “vision at a glance”, thought to result from a fast, implicit feed-forward sweep of activity in the visual system progressing from low-level areas to high-level areas (Hochstein and Ahissar (2002)Neuron, 36, 791-804). The details needed to overtly guide behavior would be retrieved in a secondary processing step of “vision with scrutiny”, proceeding in a feed-back manner, from high-level to low-level areas. This secondary and optional descending process could thus later enrich conscious visual percepts with details. Our hypothesis provides parsimonious explanations for two intriguing findings: the double dissociation between attention and consciousness, and the mismatch between objective measures and subjective reports, that is sometimes used to argue that subjective experience is an illusion. We argue here that because visual subjective experience is initially coarse, it should not be probed by asking subjects to specify details. The coarse vividness hypothesis therefore offers a framework that accounts for the existence of an initial genuine subjective experience, defined by its coarseness and vividness, optionally followed by more refined and detailed processing that could underlie finer perceptual and cognitive abilities.},

Its retinotopic organization and the interactions recently found between motion adaptation and misperceived localization may suggest, for this area, a role for priming of spatial position in addition to the established priming of motion direction. Disruption of V5/MT with repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation during the intertrial interval had the effect of abolishing priming of motion direction but no effect in priming of spatial position. These effects cannot be explained in terms of perception or task demands but only in terms of the effects of information irrelevant to the correct performance of the task stored over the intertrial interval. We suggest that the attribute of spatial position might be stored in short-term memory either in earlier areas of the motion pathways such as V3 or in higher cortical areas traditionally associated with the analysis of spatial information, for example, posterior parietal cortex or the frontal eye fields.},

In particular, data describing the sufficiency of feedforward algorithms for conscious vision and studies revealing the functional relevance of feedback connections to the striate cortex seem to offer contradictory accounts of visual information processing. TMS is a good method to experimentally address this issue, given its excellent temporal resolution and its capacity to establish causal relations between brain function and behavior. We studied 20 healthy volunteers in a visual recognition task. Subjects were briefly presented with images of animals (birds or mammals) in natural scenes and were asked to indicate the animal category. MRI-guided stereotaxic single TMS pulses were used to transiently disrupt striate cortex function at different times after image onset (SOA). Visual recognition was significantly impaired when TMS was applied over the occipital pole at SOAs of 100 and 220 msec. The first interval has consistently been described in previous TMS studies and is explained as the interruption of the feedforward volley of activity. Given the late latency and discrete nature of the second peak, we hypothesize that it represents the disruption of a feedback projection to V1, probably from other areas in the visual network. These results provide causal evidence for the necessity of recurrent interactive processing, through feedforward and feedback connections, in visual recognition of natural complex images.},

In 2 macaque monkeys, 6 neuroanatomical tracers were injected in the rostral and caudal auditory cortex, posterior parietal cortex (PE/PEa in area 5), and dorsal and ventral premotor cortical areas (PMd, PMv), demonstrating the existence of overlapping territories of thalamic projections to areas of different modalities (sensory and motor). TC projections, distinct from the ones arising from specific unimodal sensory nuclei, were observed from motor thalamus to PE/PEa or auditory cortex and from sensory thalamus to PMd/PMv. The central lateral nucleus and the mediodorsal nucleus project to all injected areas, but the most significant overlap across modalities was found in the medial pulvinar nucleus. The present results demonstrate the presence of thalamic territories integrating different sensory modalities with motor attributes. Based on the divergent/convergent pattern of TC and corticothalamic projections, 4 distinct mechanisms of multisensory and sensorimotor interplay are proposed.},

We show that these models can be tested on the basis of their predicted responses to certain visual stimuli, without the need for pharmacological or physiological manipulations. First, we consider a detailed recurrent model proposed by Somers, Nelson and Sur [(1995) Journal of Neuroscience, 15, 5448-5465] and show that it can be simplified to a single equation: a center-surround feedback filter in the orientation domain. Then, we explore the responses of the simplified model to stimuli containing two or more orientations. We find that the model exhibits peculiar responses to stimuli containing two orientations, such as plaids or crosses: if the component orientations differ by less than 45 deg the model cannot distinguish between them; if the orientations differ by more than 45 deg the model overestimates their angle by as much as 30 deg. Moreover, the model cannot signal the presence of three orientations separated by 60 deg (it responds as if there were only two orientations), and the addition of two-dimensional visual noise to an oriented stimulus results in strong spurious responses at the orthogonal orientation. We argue that the effects of attraction and repulsion between orientations and the emergence of responses at off-optimal orientations are common to a wide class of feedback models of orientation selectivity. These models could thus be tested by measuring the visual responses of cortical neurons to stimuli containing multiple orientations.},

These linear and nonlinear mechanisms might be the only essential determinants of the response, or alternatively, there may be additional fundamental determinants yet to be identified. Research is progressing with the goals of defining a single “standard model” for each stage of the visual pathway and testing the predictive power of these models on the responses to movies of natural scenes. These predictive models represent, at a given stage of the visual pathway, a compact description of visual computation.

Here, we recorded intracellularly from a large population of regular spiking (RS; presumed excitatory) and fast spiking (FS; presumed inhibitory) cells in layers 2-6 of primary visual cortex. In layer 4, where selectivity for orientation and spatial frequency first emerges, we found no untuned FS cells. Instead, the tuning of the spike output of layer 4 FS cells was significantly but moderately broader than that of RS cells. However, the tuning of the underlying synaptic responses was not different, indicating that the difference in spike-output selectivity resulted from differences in the transformation of synaptic input into firing rate. Layer 4 FS cells exhibited significantly lower input resistance and faster time constants than layer 4 RS cells, leading to larger and faster membrane potential (V(m)) fluctuations. FS cell V(m) fluctuations were more broadly tuned than those of RS cells and matched spike-output tuning, suggesting that the broader spike tuning of these cells was driven by visually evoked synaptic noise. These differences were not observed outside of layer 4. Thus, cell type-specific differences in stimulus feature selectivity at the first level of cortical sensory processing may arise as a result of distinct biophysical properties that determine the dynamics of synaptic integration.},

Here we identify cellular mechanisms underlying the sensitivity of cortical neurons to the timing of sensory-evoked synaptic inputs. We find that temporally coincident inputs to layer 4 neurons in primary visual cortex evoke an increase in spike precision and supralinear spike summation. Underlying this nonlinear summation are changes in the evoked excitatory conductance and the associated membrane potential response, and a lengthening of the window between excitation and inhibition. Furthermore, fast-spiking inhibitory interneurons in layer 4 exhibit a shorter window of temporal sensitivity compared with excitatory neurons. In contrast to the enhanced response to synchronous inputs by layer 4 neurons, sensory input integration in downstream cortical layers is more linear and less sensitive to timing. Neurons in the input layer of cortex are thus uniquely optimized to detect and encode synchronous sensory-evoked inputs.},

abstract = {Although the functional properties of individual neurons in primary visual cortex have been studied intensely, little is known about how neuronal groups could encode changing visual stimuli using temporal activity patterns. To explore this, we used in vivo two-photon calcium imaging to record the activity of neuronal populations in primary visual cortex of awake mice in the presence and absence of visual stimulation. Multidimensional analysis of the network activity allowed us to identify neuronal ensembles defined as groups of cells firing in synchrony. These synchronous groups of neurons were themselves activated in sequential temporal patterns, which repeated at much higher proportions than chance and were triggered by specific visual stimuli such as natural visual scenes. Interestingly, sequential patterns were also present in recordings of spontaneous activity without any sensory stimulation and were accompanied by precise firing sequences at the single-cell level. Moreover, intrinsic dynamics could be used to predict the occurrence of future neuronal ensembles. Our data demonstrate that visual stimuli recruit similar sequential patterns to the ones observed spontaneously, consistent with the hypothesis that already existing Hebbian cell assemblies firing in predefined temporal sequences could be the microcircuit substrate that encodes visual percepts changing in time.},

abstract = {The key objective of this study was to determine the distribution and morphology of koniocellular (K) lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) axons in primary visual cortex (V1) of the macaque monkey. In particular, we were interested in understanding whether subpopulations of K axons exist in this species and, if so, if these subpopulations arise from different K layers of the LGN. Restricted injections of the tracers, biotinilated dextran amine, or Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin were targeted to specific LGN K layers under electrophysiological guidance and immunocytochemistry was used to visualize labeled axons in cortex that were subsequently reconstructed through serial sections. A total of 36 complete axons and 166 axon segments were reconstructed. Our results identified at least 2 main subpopulations of K axons in macaque V1 based on branching patterns and bouton distribution. Axons that arise primarily from LGN layers K1 and K2 are morphologically simple and tend to branch in cortical layers 1 and 3A. These axons give rise to fewer boutons than seen in axons arising from the dorsal K LGN layers K3–K6. Axons that arise from LGN layers K3–K6 terminate as complex, focused arbors in the cytochrome oxidase (CO) blobs in layer 3B, with only occasional simple projections to the more superficial layers of cortex. Combined with previous observations, our data suggest that there are at least 3 subclasses of K LGN axons in macaque monkey that are similar to K axons identified earlier in both nocturnal simian owl monkeys (Ding and Casagrande 1997) and in prosimian, bush babies (Lachica and Casagrande 1992) suggesting that the LGN K channels that terminate in the CO blobs and in layer 1 are not unique to macaque monkeys but are a common primate feature.},

abstract = {Although the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is one of the most thoroughly characterized thalamic nuclei, its functional role remains controversial. Traditionally, the LGN in primates has been viewed as the lowest level of a set of feedforward parallel visual pathways to cortex. These feedforward pathways are pictured as connected hierarchies of areas designed to construct the visual image gradually - adding more complex features as one marches through successive levels of the hierarchy. In terms of synapse number and circuitry, the anatomy suggests that the LGN can be viewed also as the ultimate terminus in a series of feedback pathways that originate at the highest cortical levels. Since the visual system is dynamic, a more accurate picture of image construction might be one in which information flows bidirectionally, through both the feedforward and feedback pathways constantly and simultaneously. Based upon evidence from anatomy, physiology, and imaging, we argue that the LGN is more than a simple gate for retinal information. Here, we review evidence that suggests that one function of the LGN is to enhance relevant visual signals through circuits related to both motor planning and attention. Specifically, we argue that major extraretinal inputs to the LGN may provide: (1) eye movement information to enhance and bind visual signals related to new saccade targets and (2) top-down and bottom-up information about target relevance to selectively enhance visual signals through spatial attention.},

Here, the process of updating visual location is described as predictive shifts of location ‘pointers’ to attended targets, analogous to predictive activation seen cross-modally. We argue that these location pointers, the core operators of spatial attention, are linked to identity information and that such a link is necessary to establish a workable visual architecture and to explain frequently reported positive spatiotopic biases.},

abstract = {Information is integrated across the visual field to transform local features into a global percept. We now know that V1 neurons provide more spatial integration than originally thought due to the existence of their nonclassical inhibitory surrounds. To understand spatial integration in the visual cortex, we have studied the nature and extent of center and surround influences on neuronal response. We used drifting sinusoidal gratings in circular and annular apertures to estimate the sizes of the receptive field’s excitatory center and suppressive surround. We used combinations of stimuli inside and outside the receptive field to explore the nature of the surround influence on the receptive field center as a function of the relative and absolute contrast of stimuli in the two regions. We conclude that the interaction is best explained as a divisive modulation of response gain by signals from the surround. We then develop a receptive field model based on the ratio of signals from Gaussian-shaped center and surround mechanisms. We show that this model can account well for the variations in receptive field size with contrast that we and others have observed and for variations in size with the state of contrast adaptation. The model achieves this success by simple variations in the relative gain of the two component mechanisms of the receptive field. This model thus offers a parsimonious explanation of a variety of phenomena involving changes in apparent receptive field size and accounts for these phenomena purely in terms of two receptive field mechanisms that do not themselves change in size. We used the extent of the center mechanism in our model as an indicator of the spatial extent of the central excitatory portion of the receptive field. We compared the extent of the center to measurements of horizontal connections within V1 and determined that horizontal intracortical connections are well matched in extent to the receptive field center mechanism. Input to the suppressive surround may come in part from feedback signals from higher areas.},

Neurophysiol. 88: 2547-2556, 2002. The responsiveness of neurons in V1 is modulated by stimuli placed outside their classical receptive fields. This nonclassical surround provides input from a larger portion of the visual scene than originally thought, permitting integration of information at early levels in the visual processing stream. Signals from the surround have been reported variously to be suppressive and facilitatory, selective and unselective. We tested the specificity of influences from the surround by studying the interactions between drifting sinusoidal gratings carefully confined to conservatively defined center and surround regions. We found that the surround influence was always suppressive when the surround grating was at the neuron’s preferred orientation. Suppression tended to be stronger when the surround grating also moved in the neuron’s preferred direction, rather than its opposite. When the orientation in the surround was 90{degrees} from the preferred orientation (orthogonal), suppression was weaker, and facilitation was sometimes evident. The tuning of surround signals therefore tended to match the tuning of the center, though the tuning of the surround was somewhat broader. The tuning of suppression also depended on the contrast of the center grating[---]when the center grating was reduced in contrast, orthogonal surround stimuli became relatively more suppressive. We also found evidence for the tuning of the surround being dependent to some degree on the stimulus used in the center[---]suppression was often stronger for a given center stimulus when the parameters of the surround grating matched the parameters of the center grating even when the center grating was not itself of the optimal direction or orientation. We also explored the spatial distribution of surround influence and found an orderly relationship between the orientation of grating patches presented to regions of the surround and the position of greatest suppression. When surround gratings were oriented parallel to the preferred orientation of the receptive field, suppression was strongest at the receptive field ends. When surround gratings were orthogonal, suppression was strongest on the flanks. We conclude that the surround has complex effects on responses from the classical receptive field. We suggest that the underlying mechanism of this complexity may involve interactions between relatively simple center and surround mechanisms.},

We used our observations to evaluate principles governing the use of optogenetic techniques in the study of the neuronal bases of behavior in monkeys, particularly how experimental design must address relevant parameters, such as the application of light to subcortical structures, the spread of viral injections, and the extent of neuronal inactivation with light.},

abstract = {A critical step in determining how a neuron contributes to visual processing is determining its visual receptive field (RF). While recording from neurons in frontal eye field (FEF) of awake monkeys (Macaca mulatta), we probed the visual field with small spots of light and found excitatory RFs that decreased in strength from RF center to periphery. However, presenting stimuli with different diameters centered on the RF revealed suppressive surrounds that overlapped the previously determined excitatory RF and reduced responses by 84%, on average. Consequently, in that overlap area, stimulation produced excitation or suppression, depending on the stimulus. Strong stimulation of the RF periphery with annular stimuli allowed us to quantify this effect. A modified difference of gaussians model that independently varied center and surround activation accounted for the nonlinear activity in the overlap area. Our results suggest that (1) the suppressive surrounds found in FEF are fundamentally the same as those in V1 except for the size and strength of excitatory and suppressive mechanisms, (2) methodically assaying suppressive surrounds in FEF is essential for correctly interpreting responses to large and/or peripheral stimuli and therefore understanding the effects of stimulus context, and (3) regulating the relative strength of the surround clearly changes neuronal responses and may therefore play a significant part in the neuronal changes resulting from visual attention and stimulus salience.},

Most decoding models have suggested complex neural circuits that compute optimal estimates of sensory parameters on the basis of responses in many sensory neurons. We propose a slightly suboptimal but practically simpler decoder. Decoding neurons integrate their inputs across 100 ms, incoming spikes are weighted by the preferred stimulus of the neuron of origin, and a local, cellular nonlinearity approximates divisive normalization without dividing explicitly. The suboptimal decoder includes two simplifying approximations. It uses estimates of firing rate across the population rather than computing the total population response, and it implements divisive normalization with local cellular mechanisms of single neurons rather than more complicated neural circuit mechanisms. When applied to the practical problem of estimating target speed from a realistic simulation of the population response in extrastriate visual area MT, the suboptimal decoder has almost the same accuracy and precision as traditional decoding models. It succeeds in predicting the precision and imprecision of motor behavior using a suboptimal decoding computation because it adds only a small amount of imprecision to the code for target speed in MT, which is itself imprecise.},

The NHP model within biomedical research has played an important role in the development of vaccines, assisted reproductive technologies, and new therapies for many diseases. Biomedical research has not been the primary role of NHPs. They have mainly been used for safety evaluation and pharmacokinetics studies, rather than determining therapeutic efficacy. The development of the first transgenic rhesus macaque (2001) revolutionized the role of NHP models in biomedicine. Development of the transgenic NHP model of Huntington’s disease (2008), with distinctive clinical features, further suggested the uniqueness of the model system; and the potential role of the NHP model for human genetic disorders. Modeling human genetic diseases using NHPs will continue to thrive because of the latest advances in molecular, genetic, and embryo technologies. NHPs rising role in biomedical research, specifically pre-clinical studies, is foreseeable. The path toward the development of transgenic NHPs and the prospect of transgenic NHPs in their new role in future biomedicine needs to be reviewed.

When examining the impact of a synaptic input on postsynaptic firing, it is important to distinguish a change in overall firing probability from a true change in neuronal sensitivity to a particular input (synaptic efficacy) that corresponds to a change in detection performance. Here we study the impact of background synaptic input on neuronal sensitivity to individual synaptic inputs using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. We use the area under the ROC curve as a measure of synaptic efficacy, here defined as the ability of a postsynaptic action potential to identify a particular synaptic input event. An advantage of using ROC analysis to measure synaptic efficacy is that it provides a measure that is independent of postsynaptic firing rate. Furthermore, changes in mean excitation or inhibition, although affecting overall firing probability, do not modulate synaptic efficacy when measured in this way. Changes in overall conductance also affect firing probability but not this form of synaptic efficacy. Input noise, here defined as the variance of the input current, does modulate synaptic efficacy, however. This effect persists when the change in input variance is coupled with a change in conductance (as would result from changing background activity).},

By introducing a barrage of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances that mimics conditions encountered in vivo into pyramidal neurons in slices of rat somatosensory cortex, we show that the gain of a neuronal response to excitatory drive can be modulated by varying the level of “background” synaptic input. Simultaneously increasing both excitatory and inhibitory background firing rates in a balanced manner results in a divisive gain modulation of the neuronal response without appreciable signal-independent increases in firing rate or spike-train variability.

The majority of the sampled cells responded to both stimulus types, although responses to temporal texture stimuli were generally weaker than those elicited by luminance-defined stimuli. Of those units exhibiting orientation selectivity when tested with the luminance-defined stimuli, more than half were also selective for the orientation of the temporal texture stimuli. There was close correspondence between the preferred orientations and tuning bandwidths revealed with the two stimulus types. Of those units exhibiting directional selectivity when tested with the luminance-defined stimuli, about two-thirds were also selective for the direction of the temporal texture stimuli. There was close correspondence between the preferred directions revealed with the two stimulus types, although bidirectional responses were somewhat more common when temporal texture stimuli were used. These results indicate that many V1 neurons encode orientation and direction of motion of retinal image features in a manner that is largely independent of whether the feature is defined by luminance or temporal texture contrast.

abstract = {The amount of information encoded by cortical circuits depends critically on the capacity of nearby neurons to exhibit trial-to-trial (noise) correlations in their responses. Depending on their sign and relationship to signal correlations, noise correlations can either increase or decrease the population code accuracy relative to uncorrelated neuronal firing. Whereas positive noise correlations have been extensively studied using experimental and theoretical tools, the functional role of negative correlations in cortical circuits has remained elusive. We addressed this issue by performing multiple-electrode recording in the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) of alert monkey. Despite the fact that positive noise correlations decayed exponentially with the difference in the orientation preference between cells, negative correlations were uniformly distributed across the population. Using a statistical model for Fisher Information estimation, we found that a mild increase in negative correlations causes a sharp increase in network accuracy even when mean correlations were held constant. To examine the variables controlling the strength of negative correlations, we implemented a recurrent spiking network model of V1. We found that increasing local inhibition and reducing excitation causes a decrease in the firing rates of neurons while increasing the negative noise correlations, which in turn increase the population signal-to-noise ratio and network accuracy. Altogether, these results contribute to our understanding of the neuronal mechanism involved in the generation of negative correlations and their beneficial impact on cortical circuit function.},

These modulations were spatially specific: increasing task difficulty enhanced V1 neuronal firing rate at the focus of attention and suppressed it in regions surrounding the focus. Moreover, we found that response enhancement and suppression are mediated by distinct populations of neurons that differ in direction selectivity, spike width, interspike-interval distribution and contrast sensitivity.

The mechanism by which neurons process the coding of signals is not well understood. Here, we propose that coincidence detection, one of the ways to describe the functionality of a single neural cell, can improve the reliability and the precision of signal detection through detection of presynaptic input synchrony. Using a simplified neuronal network model composed of dozens of integrate-and-fire neurons and a single coincidence-detector neuron, we show how the network reads out the subthreshold noisy signals reliably and precisely. We find suitable pairing parameters, the threshold and the detection time window of the coincidence-detector neuron, that optimize the precision and reliability of the neuron. Furthermore, it is observed that the refractory period induces an oscillation in the spontaneous firing, but the neuron can inhibit this activity and improve the reliability and precision further. In the case of intermediate intrinsic states of the input neuron, the network responds to the input more efficiently. These results present the critical link between spiking synchrony and noisy signal transfer, which is utilized in coincidence detection, resulting in enhancement of temporally sensitive coding scheme.},

abstract = {In natural scenes, multiple objects are usually presented simultaneously. How do specific areas of the brain respond to multiple objects based on their responses to each individual object? Previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies have shown that the activity induced by a multi-object stimulus in the primary visual cortex (V1) can be predicted by the linear or nonlinear sum of the activities induced by its component objects. However, there has been little evidence from electroencephelogram (EEG) studies so far. Here we explored how V1 responded to multiple objects by comparing the EEG signals evoked by a three-grating stimulus with those evoked by its two components (the central grating and two flanking gratings). We focused on the earliest visual component C1 (onset latency ~50 ms) because it has been shown to reflect the feedforward responses of neurons in V1. We found that when the stimulus was unattended, the amplitude of the C1 evoked by the three-grating stimulus roughly equalled the sum of the amplitudes of the C1s evoked by its two components, regardless of the distances between these gratings. When the stimulus was attended, this linear spatial summation existed only when the three gratings were far apart from each other. When the three gratings were close to each other, the spatial summation became compressed. These results suggest that the earliest visual responses in V1 follow a linear summation rule when attention is not involved and that attention can affect the earliest interactions between multiple objects.},

These correlations render most previously proposed decoding rules inefficient relative to one that uses spatially antagonistic center-surround summation.

Here we used voltage-sensitive dye imaging (VSDI) to directly measure neural population responses in the primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys performing a reaction-time detection task. Focusing on the temporal properties of the population responses, we found that V1 responses are consistent with a stimulus-evoked response with amplitude and latency that depend on target contrast and a stimulus-independent additive noise with long-lasting temporal correlations. The noise had much lower amplitude than the ongoing activity reported previously in anesthetized animals. To understand the implications of these properties for subsequent processing stages that mediate behavior, we derived the Bayesian ideal observer that specifies how to optimally use neural responses in reaction time tasks. Using the ideal observer analysis, we show that 1) the observed temporal correlations limit the performance benefit that can be attained by accumulating V1 responses over time, 2) a simple temporal decorrelation operation with time-lagged excitation and inhibition minimizes the detrimental effect of these correlations, 3) the neural information relevant for target detection is concentrated in the initial response following stimulus onset, and 4) a decoder that optimally uses V1 responses far outperforms the monkey in both speed and accuracy. Finally, we demonstrate that for our particular detection task, temporal decorrelation followed by an appropriate running integrator can approach the speed and accuracy of the optimal decoder.},

abstract = {The middle temporal (MT) area is a cortical area integral to the “where” pathway of primate visual processing, signaling the movement and position of objects in the visual world. The receptive field of a single MT neuron is sensitive to the direction of object motion but is too large to signal precise spatial position. Here, we asked if the activity of MT neurons could be combined to support the high spatial precision required in the where pathway. With the use of multielectrode arrays, we recorded simultaneously neural activity at 24–65 sites in area MT of anesthetized marmoset monkeys. We found that although individual receptive fields span more than 5° of the visual field, the combined population response can support fine spatial discriminations (<0.2°). This is because receptive fields at neighboring sites overlapped substantially, and changes in spatial position are therefore projected onto neural activity in a large ensemble of neurons. This fine spatial discrimination is supported primarily by neurons with receptive fields flanking the target locations. Population performance is degraded (by 13–22%) when correlations in neural activity are ignored, further reflecting the contribution of population neural interactions. Our results show that population signals can provide high spatial precision despite large receptive fields, allowing area MT to represent both the motion and the position of objects in the visual world.},

abstract = {Attention influences visual processing in striate and extrastriate cortex, which has been extensively studied for spatial-, object-, and feature-based attention. Most studies exploring neural signatures of feature-based attention have trained animals to attend to an object identified by a certain feature and ignore objects/displays identified by a different feature. Little is known about the effects of feature-selective attention, where subjects attend to one stimulus feature domain (e.g., color) of an object while features from different domains (e.g., direction of motion) of the same object are ignored. To study this type of feature-selective attention in area MT in the middle temporal sulcus, we trained macaque monkeys to either attend to and report the direction of motion of a moving sine wave grating (a feature for which MT neurons display strong selectivity) or attend to and report its color (a feature for which MT neurons have very limited selectivity). We hypothesized that neurons would upregulate their firing rate during attend-direction conditions compared with attend-color conditions. We found that feature-selective attention significantly affected 22% of MT neurons. Contrary to our hypothesis, these neurons did not necessarily increase firing rate when animals attended to direction of motion but fell into one of two classes. In one class, attention to color increased the gain of stimulus-induced responses compared with attend-direction conditions. The other class displayed the opposite effects. Feature-selective activity modulations occurred earlier in neurons modulated by attention to color compared with neurons modulated by attention to motion direction. Thus feature-selective attention influences neuronal processing in macaque area MT but often exhibited a mismatch between the preferred stimulus dimension (direction of motion) and the preferred attention dimension (attention to color).},

We test these notions within auditory perception by independently manipulating top-down expectation and attentional precision alongside bottom-up stimulus predictability. Our findings support an integrative interpretation of commonly observed electrophysiological signatures of neurodynamics, namely mismatch negativity (MMN), P300, and contingent negative variation (CNV), as manifestations along successive levels of predictive complexity. Early first-level processing indexed by the MMN was sensitive to stimulus predictability: here, attentional precision enhanced early responses, but explicit top-down expectation diminished it. This pattern was in contrast to later, second-level processing indexed by the P300: although sensitive to the degree of predictability, responses at this level were contingent on attentional engagement and in fact sharpened by top-down expectation. At the highest level, the drift of the CNV was a fine-grained marker of top-down expectation itself. Source reconstruction of high-density EEG, supported by intracranial recordings, implicated temporal and frontal regions differentially active at early and late levels. The cortical generators of the CNV suggested that it might be involved in facilitating the consolidation of context-salient stimuli into conscious perception. These results provide convergent empirical support to promising recent accounts of attention and expectation in predictive coding.},

So called ‘floating’ microelectrode arrays are implanted in cortical regions of interest and are coupled via a flexible cable to their connectors which are fixed to the skull by a cement cap or a titanium pedestal, such as the Cereport system, which has been approved for human use. The use of bone cement has several disadvantages including the creation of infection prone areas at the interface with the skull and surrounding skin. Alternatively, the more biocompatible Cereport has a limited carrying capacity and is far more expensive. In this paper, we describe a new implantation technique, which combines the biocompatibility of titanium, a high carrying capacity with a minimal skull footprint, and a decreased chance of infection, all in a relatively inexpensive package. This technique utilizes an in-house fabricated ‘Nesting Platform’ (NP), mounted on a titanium headpost to hold multiple connectors above the skin, making the headpost the only transcutaneous object. The use of delrin, a durable, lightweight and easily machinable material, allows easy customization of the NP for a wide variety of floating electrodes and their connectors. The ultimate result is a longer survival time with superior neural recordings that can potentially last longer than with traditional implantation techniques.},

The direction of motion of a bar was estimated by comparing the timing of responses in ensembles of parasol (magnocellular-projecting) retinal ganglion cells recorded simultaneously, using a cross-correlation approach similar to standard models of motion sensing. To identify the temporal resolution of motion signals, spike trains were low-pass filtered before estimating the direction of motion. The filter time constant that resulted in most accurate motion sensing was in the range of 10-50 msec for a range of stimulus speeds and contrasts and approached a lower limit of [~]10 msec at high speeds and contrasts.

The pathways by which vestibular signals are conveyed to area MSTd are currently unclear, and one possibility is that vestibular signals are already present in areas that are known to provide visual inputs to MSTd. Thus, we examined whether selective vestibular responses are exhibited by single neurons in the middle temporal area (MT), a visual motion-sensitive region that projects heavily to area MSTd. We compared responses in MT and MSTd to three-dimensional rotational and translational stimuli that were either presented using a motion platform (vestibular condition) or simulated using optic flow (visual condition). When monkeys fixated a visual target generated by a projector, half of MT cells (and most MSTd neurons) showed significant tuning during the vestibular rotation condition. However, when the fixation target was generated by a laser in a dark room, most MT neurons lost their vestibular tuning whereas most MSTd neurons retained their selectivity. Similar results were obtained for free viewing in darkness. Our findings indicate that MT neurons do not show genuine vestibular responses to self-motion; rather, their tuning in the vestibular rotation condition can be explained by retinal slip due to a residual vestibulo-ocular reflex. Thus, the robust vestibular signals observed in area MSTd do not arise through inputs from area MT.},

Although the effect of vergence angle on horizontal disparity selectivity in early visual cortex has been examined (with mixed results), the effect of the vertical disparity field has not been explored. We manipulated the vertical disparities in a large random-dot stimulus to simulate different viewing distances, and we examined the effect of this manipulation on both the responses of neurons in the middle temporal (MT) area and on the psychophysical performance of the animal in a curvature discrimination task. We report here that alterations to the vertical disparity field have no effect on the horizontal disparity tuning of MT neurons. However, the same manipulation strongly and systematically biases the monkey’s judgments of curvature, consistent with previous human studies. We conclude that monkeys, like humans, make use of the vertical disparity field to estimate viewing distance, but that the physiological mechanisms for this effect occur either downstream of MT or in a different pathway.},

However, the underlying mechanisms for the apparent differences in cognitive processing styles have not been known. In the present study, we examined the possibility that the cultural differences arise from culturally different viewing patterns when confronted with a naturalistic scene. We measured the eye movements of American and Chinese participants while they viewed photographs with a focal object on a complex background. In fact, the Americans fixated more on focal objects than did the Chinese, and the Americans tended to look at the focal object more quickly. In addition, the Chinese made more saccades to the background than did the Americans. Thus, it appears that differences in judgment and memory may have their origins in differences in what is actually attended as people view a scene.},

abstract = {Intuitively one might think that larger objects should be easier to see, and indeed performance on visual tasks generally improves with increasing stimulus size [1] and [2]. Recently, a remarkable exception to this rule was reported [3]: when a high-contrast, moving stimulus is presented very briefly, motion perception deteriorates as stimulus size increases. This psychophysical surround suppression has been interpreted as a correlate of the neuronal surround suppression that is commonly found in the visual cortex [3], [4] and [5]. However, many visual cortical neurons lack surround suppression, and so one might expect that the brain would simply use their outputs to discriminate the motion of large stimuli. Indeed previous work has generally found that observers rely on whichever neurons are most informative about the stimulus to perform similar psychophysical tasks [6]. Here we show that the responses of neurons in the middle temporal (MT) area of macaque monkeys provide a simple resolution to this paradox. We find that surround-suppressed MT neurons integrate motion signals relatively quickly, so that by comparison non-suppressed neurons respond poorly to brief stimuli. Thus, psychophysical surround suppression for brief stimuli can be viewed as a consequence of a strategy that weights neuronal responses according to how informative they are about a given stimulus. If this interpretation is correct, then it follows that any psychophysical experiment that uses brief motion stimuli will effectively probe the responses of MT neurons that have strong surround suppression.},

For each neuron, we assessed speed tuning for smooth motion (Deltat = 2 or 4 ms) at speeds up to 128 degrees /s and the effect of varying the value of Deltat at speeds of 16 and 32 degrees /s. Many MST neurons, like MT neurons, were tuned for the speed of smooth motion and showed decreases in firing rate as Deltat increased at a constant speed. A subset of MST neurons, however, showed monotonically increasing firing rates as a function of smooth stimulus speed, and responses to apparent motion that paralleled a previously discovered illusion where estimates of target speed increase with the value of Deltat. Opponent firing rate, defined as the difference between responses for motion in the preferred and opposite directions, peaked at values of Deltat that were consistent with the behavioral illusion. Comparison with a new sample of MT neurons recorded with the same stimuli failed to reveal comparable effects. Attempts to map the population responses in MT and MST onto the behavioral illusion of increased speed succeeded by averaging the opponent response across MST neurons, but only by applying vector averaging to determine the preferred speed of the most active MT neurons. We suggest that a vector averaging computation transforms MT’s place code for target speed into the rate code of some MST neurons},

We measured behavioral and physiological responses of monkeys on a two- and four-choice direction-discrimination decision task. For both tasks, firing rates in the lateral intraparietal area appeared to reflect the accumulation of evidence for or against each choice. Evidence accumulation began at a lower firing rate for the four-choice task, but reached a common level by the end of the decision process. The larger excursion suggests that the subjects required more evidence before making a choice. Furthermore, on both tasks, we observed a time-dependent rise in firing rates that may impose a deadline for deciding. These physiological observations constitute an effective strategy for handling increased task difficulty. The differences appear to explain subjects’ accuracy and reaction times.},

Many studies have examined the effect of a stimulus on the mean response, but few have examined the effect on response variability. We measured neural variability in 13 extracellularly recorded datasets and one intracellularly recorded dataset from seven areas spanning the four cortical lobes in monkeys and cats. In every case, stimulus onset caused a decline in neural variability. This occurred even when the stimulus produced little change in mean firing rate. The variability decline was observed in membrane potential recordings, in the spiking of individual neurons and in correlated spiking variability measured with implanted 96-electrode arrays. The variability decline was observed for all stimuli tested, regardless of whether the animal was awake, behaving or anaesthetized. This widespread variability decline suggests a rather general property of cortex, that its state is stabilized by an input.},

They are bundles of cells that support perception and action by constantly attempting to match incoming sensory inputs with top-down expectations or predictions. This is achieved using a hierarchical generative model that aims to minimize prediction error within a bidirectional cascade of cortical processing. Such accounts offer a unifying model of perception and action, illuminate the functional role of attention, and may neatly capture the special contribution of cortical processing to adaptive success. This target article critically examines this “hierarchical prediction machine” approach, concluding that it offers the best clue yet to the shape of a unified science of mind and action. Sections 1 and 2 lay out the key elements and implications of the approach. Section 3 explores a variety of pitfalls and challenges, spanning the evidential, the methodological, and the more properly conceptual. The paper ends (sections 4 and 5) by asking how such approaches might impact our more general vision of mind, experience, and agency.},

Quantitative studies were made on twenty such pairs; eight X on-centre, seven Y on-centre, two X off-centre and three Y off-centre pairs. Receptive field centre locations of cell pairs with correlated activities were very closely superimposed, having a mean centre displacement of 1.6 minutes of arc for X cells and 11 minutes of arc for Y cells. With flashed spots and annuli, responses of l.g.n. cells were almost always smaller than those of their retinal afferents, with peaks and troughs in ganglion cell responses being faithfully followed in the geniculate neurones. This is consistent with almost all impulses from the l.g.n. cell being triggered by the afferent feeding its centre. With spots of different sizes and contrasts, modulation of responses by l.g.n. inhibition was obvious, but effects were complex. With moving bright-bar stimuli, although response histograms were clearly reshaped to some extent in the l.g.n., peak firing rates under different stimulus conditions were often merely attenuated by a constant factor for most l.g.n. cells in comparison with their retinal inputs. For velocity tuning curves, a few cell pairs showed selective attenuation at high speeds, while others showed it at low speeds. All the latter group appeared to have more than one major excitatory afferent. These changes in velocity tuning occurred across the X/Y classification, so that differences in velocity preference of the X and Y systems is more blurred in the l.g.n. than in the retina.},

Transient cells had larger surrounds than sustained; the distributions were non-overlapping. Although the distributions of centre sizes overlapped, the transient cells had very significantly larger centres on average.2. There were characteristic differences in area-threshold and annulus-threshold curves and shapes of responses to brief and long flashes of light, and relative differences in the nature of surround adaptation and maintained discharge rates.3. The distinction of sustained from transient units survived over a wide range of backgrounds including the two principle reorganizations of function: relative weakening of surround components at low background; Purkinje shift at high.4. Sustained and transient units were differentially distributed in the retina: there was an overwhelming preponderance of sustained units in the area centralis.5. It is proposed that the transient units are the so-called multidendritedeep cells and the sustained units are the variously styled small ganglion cells.},

The tuning seen in hypercomplex cells is already observable to a lesser degree in retinal ganglion cells. Our experiments were carried out to determine the extent of this tuning in the lateral geniculate nucleus, which relays information from the retina to the cortex. Results show that geniculate cells have tuning properties intermediate between those of ganglion cells and hypercomplex cells. By adding together a linear array of geniculate cells, it is possible to model the characteristics of a simple cell and to demonstrate that while an elongated bar gives a minimal response in hypercomplex cells, it should have little effect on the response of simple cells.},

Here we have examined the issue in macaque parvocellular LGN cells (n = 78) to see how they compare to the cat. The first noticeable difference is that whilst in the cat approximately 16-8% of the spikes in the response to a drifting sinusoidal grating were burst spikes, in the macaque the percentage was much lower and around 2-3% in accord with previous observations (Ruiz et al, 2006; Alitto et al, 2011). Indeed in our sample only 29 cells exhibited enough reliable burst spikes to enable us to make a valid comparison of tuning properties between burst and tonic firing.
Within this group the optimal diameter for the burst spikes was 0.82° (± 0.09 SE) in comparison to 0.42° (± 0.03 SE) for the tonic spikes. These were significantly different (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon paired rank test). This pattern in the variation of optimal diameter with burst/tonic firing was the same as that observed in the cat LGN cells. However we did not observe a significant difference in the degree of patch suppression seen for the burst and tonic firing. The degree of surround suppression (assessed according to the formula PSI = [1 - (Rplat ÷ Ropt) × 100]) was 75.2 (± 5.65 SE) for the burst firing and 75.4 (± 2.81 SE) for the tonic firing (P > 0.05, Wilcoxon paired rank test). It seems that the contribution of burst firing to macaque parvocellular cell visual responses is much less than for cat LGN cells and whilst where it occurred it was driven by larger optimal diameters than the tonic firing as for the cat, in contrast to the cat there was no difference in response attenuation at larger diameters for burst/tonic firing. The functional significance of this may be that the primate visual system makes less use of the burst firing pattern in processing the visual input and alerting the cortex to the presence of a visual input (cf Sherman, 2001). It also may reflect the fact that there is greater involvement of facilitatory feedback in the responses of primate parvocellular cells to drifting gratings (Andolina et al, 2010; also see Shipp et al poster, this session).},

abstract = {Spatial context in images induces perceptual phenomena associated with salience and modulates the responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). However, the computational and ecological principles underlying contextual effects are incompletely understood. We introduce a model of natural images that includes grouping and segmentation of neighboring features based on their joint statistics, and we interpret the firing rates of V1 neurons as performing optimal recognition in this model. We show that this leads to a substantial generalization of divisive normalization, a computation that is ubiquitous in many neural areas and systems. A main novelty in our model is that the influence of the context on a target stimulus is determined by their degree of statistical dependence. We optimized the parameters of the model on natural image patches, and then simulated neural and perceptual responses on stimuli used in classical experiments. The model reproduces some rich and complex response patterns observed in V1, such as the contrast dependence, orientation tuning and spatial asymmetry of surround suppression, while also allowing for surround facilitation under conditions of weak stimulation. It also mimics the perceptual salience produced by simple displays, and leads to readily testable predictions. Our results provide a principled account of orientation-based contextual modulation in early vision and its sensitivity to the homogeneity and spatial arrangement of inputs, and lends statistical support to the theory that V1 computes visual salience.},

To investigate the relationship between complement factor H (CFH) and retinal disease, we performed functional and anatomical analysis in 2-year-old CFH-deficient (cfh(-/-)) mice. cfh(-/-) animals exhibited significantly reduced visual acuity and rod response amplitudes on electroretinography compared with age-matched controls. Retinal imaging by confocal scanning laser ophthalmoscopy revealed an increase in autofluorescent subretinal deposits in the cfh(-/-) mice, whereas the fundus and vasculature appeared normal. Examination of tissue sections showed an accumulation of complement C3 in the neural retina of the cfh(-/-) mice, together with a decrease in electron-dense material, thinning of Bruch’s membrane, changes in the cellular distribution of retinal pigment epithelial cell organelles, and disorganization of rod photoreceptor outer segments. Collectively, these data show that, in the absence of any specific exogenous challenge to the innate immune system, CFH is critically required for the long-term functional health of the retina.},

The recent advent of recording techniques such as multielectrode arrays and two-photon imaging has made it easier to measure correlations, opening the door for detailed exploration of their properties and contributions to cortical processing. However, studies have reported discrepant findings, providing a confusing picture. Here we briefly review these studies and conduct simulations to explore the influence of several experimental and physiological factors on correlation measurements. Differences in response strength, the time window over which spikes are counted, spike sorting conventions and internal states can all markedly affect measured correlations and systematically bias estimates. Given these complicating factors, we offer guidelines for interpreting correlation data and a discussion of how best to evaluate the effect of correlations on cortical processing.},

Attention also typically increases the firing rates of cortical sensory neurons. Rate increases improve the signal-to-noise ratio of individual neurons, and this improvement has been assumed to underlie attention-related improvements in behavior. We recorded dozens of neurons simultaneously in visual area V4 and found that changes in single neurons accounted for only a small fraction of the improvement in the sensitivity of the population. Instead, over 80% of the attentional improvement in the population signal was caused by decreases in the correlations between the trial-to-trial fluctuations in the responses of pairs of neurons. These results suggest that the representation of sensory information in populations of neurons and the way attention affects the sensitivity of the population may only be understood by considering the interactions between neurons.},

Changes in the correlated firing of pairs of neurons may provide a metric of changes in functional circuitry during behavior. We studied dynamic changes in functional circuitry by analyzing the noise correlations of simultaneously recorded MT neurons in two behavioral contexts: one that promotes cooperative interactions between the two neurons and another that promotes competitive interactions. We found that identical visual stimuli give rise to differences in noise correlation in the two contexts, suggesting that MT neurons receive inputs of central origin whose strength changes with the task structure. The data are consistent with a mixed feature-based attentional strategy model in which the animal sometimes alternates attention between opposite directions of motion and sometimes attends to the two directions simultaneously.},

For example, color–grapheme synesthetes automatically perceive achromatic numbers as colored (e.g., 7 is turquoise). Although synesthetes know when a given color matches the one evoked by a certain number, colors do not automatically give rise to any sort of number experience. The behavioral consequences of synesthesia have been documented using Stroop-like paradigms, usually using color judgments. Owing to the unidirectional nature of the synesthetic experience, little has been done to obtain performance measures that could indicate whether bidirectional cross-activation occurs in synesthesia. Here it is shown that colors do implicitly evoke numerical mnitudes in color–grapheme synesthetes, but not in nonsynesthetic participants. It is proposed that bidirectional coactivation of brain areas is responsible for the links between color and magnitude processing in color–grapheme synesthesia and that unidirectional models of synesthesia might have to be revised.},

This ‘binding’ mechanism requires that spatially distributed cells fire together with millisecond range precision7, 8; however, it is not clear how such coordinated timing is achieved given that the frequency of gamma oscillations varies substantially across space and time, from 25 to almost 150 Hz1, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13. Here we show that gamma oscillations in the CA1 area of the hippocampus split into distinct fast and slow frequency components that differentially couple CA1 to inputs from the medial entorhinal cortex, an area that provides information about the animal’s current position14, 15, 16, 17, and CA3, a hippocampal subfield essential for storage of such information14, 18, 19. Fast gamma oscillations in CA1 were synchronized with fast gamma in medial entorhinal cortex, and slow gamma oscillations in CA1 were coherent with slow gamma in CA3. Significant proportions of cells in medial entorhinal cortex and CA3 were phase-locked to fast and slow CA1 gamma waves, respectively. The two types of gamma occurred at different phases of the CA1 theta rhythm and mostly on different theta cycles. These results point to routeing of information as a possible function of gamma frequency variations in the brain and provide a mechanism for temporal segregation of potentially interfering information from different sources.},

In this work, we explored the mechanisms of attention induced RF shifts in cortical network models that receive an attentional ‘spotlight’. Our main results are threefold. First, whereas a ‘spotlight’ input always produces toward-attention shift of the population activity profile, we found that toward-attention shifts in RFs of single cells requires multiplicative gain modulation. Secondly, in a feedforward two-layer model, focal attentional gain modulation in first-layer neurons induces RF shift in second-layer neurons downstream. In contrast to experimental observations, the feedforward model typically fails to produce RF shifts in second-layer neurons when attention is directed beyond RF boundaries. We then show that an additive spotlight input combined with a recurrent network mechanism can produce the observed RF shift. Inhibitory effects in a surround of the attentional focus accentuate this RF shift and induce RF shrinking. Thirdly, we considered interrelationship between visual selective attention and adaptation. Our analysis predicts that the RF size is enlarged (respectively reduced) by attentional signal directed near a cell’s RF center in a recurrent network (resp. in a feedforward network); the opposite is true for visual adaptation. Therefore, a refined estimation of the RF size during attention and after adaptation would provide a probe to differentiate recurrent versus feedforward mechanisms for RF shifts.},

Terminal fields of magnocellular fibers spanned most of the width of their target layer, whereas those of parvocellular fibers were restricted to approximately one-half the width of their target layers; almost all terminal fields were oriented along lines of projection. All of the optic tract fibers that we examined terminated in only one layer of the lateral geniculate nucleus (GL), including a population of fine caliber fibers that project to the intercalated layers, and none had collateral projections outside the GL.

Topographical data from the electrophysiological investigation of the LGN by Malpeli and Baker (’75) were displayed on maps of all six layers. As known from previous studies, there is a significant over-representation of central vision in the LGN. Unexpectedly, though, the visual representation is anisotropic over portions of most LGN layers. That is, the linear magnification factor (millimeters along the laminar surface per degree of visual field) is not equal for all directions from a given point in the visual field. Moreover, the visual representations in the parvicellular and magnocellular divisions of the LGN differ both in their emphasis on central vision and in their anisotropies. To determine the degree of individual variability, laminar maps were prepared from the LGN of seven other hemispheres. The shapes of laminar maps varied considerably between LGNs, from nearly circular to highly elliptical, but the surface area was relatively constant for each layer. Topographical organization, determined by mapping the optic disc representation on the LGN laminae and by labeling from anterograde and retrograde tracer injections in striate cortex, showed significant individual variability. Interestingly, the visual representations in the LGN and striate cortex are topologically inverted with respect to one another. This indicates that the establishment of geniculocortical connections involves a systematic crossing-over of fibers. Information on cell densities and magnification factors in striate cortex obtained from other studies was compared to the results of the present study in order to estimate ratios of cortical neurons to LGN neurons at different eccentricities. The total number of cortical neurons per LGN neuron is about 130 on average, but it extends over approximately a tenfold range, from less than 100 in the far periphery to nearly 1,000 in the fovea. The estimated number of cells in layers 4A and 4C beta per parvicellular layer neuron is smaller and extends over a slightly narrower range, from 30 to 240, whereas the number of layer 4C alpha neurons per magnocellular neuron varies more widely, from about 45 to 7,000.},

This is evidenced by the parietal activation observed in brain imaging experiments performed during visuo- spatial tasks, and by the contralateral neglect syndrome that often accompanies parietal lesions. Individual neurons in monkey parietal cortex respond vigorously to the appearance of single, behaviorally relevant stimuli, but little is known about how they respond to more complex visual displays. The current experiments addressed this issue by recording activity from single neurons in area 7a of the PPC in monkeys performing a spatial version of a match-to-sample task. The task required them to locate salient stimuli in multiple-stimulus displays and release a lever after a subsequent stimulus appeared at the same location. Neurons responded preferentially to the appearance of salient stimuli inside their receptive fields. The presence of multiple stimuli did not affect appreciably the spatial tuning of responses in the majority of neurons or the population code for the location of the salient stimulus. Responses to salient stimuli could be distinguished from background stimuli approximately 100 ms after the onset of the cue. These results suggest that area 7a neurons represent the location of the stimulus attracting the animal’s attention and can provide the spatial information required for directing attention to a salient stimulus in a complex scene.},

We used one-dimensional sparse noise stimuli to generate first-order spatiotemporal maps and second-order two-bar interaction maps for 65 simple and 124 complex direction-selective cells in alert macaque V1. Spatial and temporal phase differences between light and dark space-time maps clearly distinguished simple and complex cell populations. Complex cells usually showed similar direction preferences to light and dark bars, but many of the directional simple cells were much more direction selective to one sign of contrast than the reverse. We show that this is predicted by a simple energy model. Some of the direction-selective simple cells showed multiple space-time-slanted subregions, but others (previously described as S1 cells) had space-time maps that looked like just one subregion of an ordinary simple cell. Both simple and complex cells showed directional interactions (nonlinearities) to pairs of flashed bars (a 2-bar apparent-motion stimulus). The space-time slant of the simple cells correlated with the optimum dX/dT (velocity) of the paired-bar interactions. Some complex cells also showed a space-time slant; the direction of the slant usually correlated with the preferred direction of motion, but the degree of slant correlated with the inferred velocity tuning only when measured by a weighted-centroid calculation. Principal components analysis of the simple-cell space-time maps yielded one fast temporally biphasic component and a slower temporally monophasic component. We saw no consistent pattern for the spatial phase of the components, unlike previous reports; however, we show that principal components analysis may not distinguish between spatial offsets and phase offsets},

Because the delta subunit is highly expressed in the thalamus, we tested whether thalamocortical (TC) neurons of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and ventrobasal complex exhibit tonic inhibition. Focal application of gabazine (GBZ) (50 microM) revealed the presence of a 20 pA tonic current in 75 and 63% of TC neurons from both nuclei, respectively. No tonic current was observed in GABAergic neurons of the nucleus reticularis thalami (NRT). Bath application of 1 microM GABA increased tonic current amplitude to approximately 70 pA in 100% of TC neurons, but it was still not observed in NRT neurons. In dLGN TC neurons, the tonic current was sensitive to low concentrations of the delta subunit-specific receptor agonists allotetrahydrodeoxycorticosterone (100 nM) and 4,5,6,7-tetrahydroisoxazolo[5,4-c]-pyridin-3-ol (THIP) (100 nM) but insensitive to the benzodiazepine flurazepam (5 microM). Bath application of low concentrations of GBZ (25-200 nM) preferentially blocked the tonic current, whereas phasic synaptic inhibition was primarily maintained. Under intracellular current-clamp conditions, the preferential block of the tonic current with GBZ led to a small depolarization and increase in input resistance. Using extracellular single-unit recordings, block of the tonic current caused the cessation of low-threshold burst firing and promoted tonic firing. Enhancement of the tonic current by THIP hyperpolarized TC neurons and promoted burst firing. Thus, tonic current in TC neurons generates an inhibitory tone. Its modulation contributes to the shift between different firing modes, promotes the transition between different behavioral states, and predisposes to absence seizures.},

Using single-neurone recording in the rat VB in vivo with local application of the selective Group II agonist LY354740 and the subtype selective mGlu2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) LY487379, our findings were twofold. Firstly, we found that there is an mGlu2 component to the effects of LY354740 on sensory responses in the VB. Secondly, we have demonstrated that application of the PAM alone can modulate sensory responses of single neurones in vivo. This indicates that mGlu2 receptors can be activated by endogenous agonist following physiological sensory stimulation. We speculate that the mGlu2 subtype could be activated under physiological stimulus-evoked conditions by ‘glutamate spillover’ from synapses between excitatory sensory afferents and VB neurones that can lead to a reduction in sensory-evoked inhibition arising from the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). We propose that this potential mGlu2 receptor modulation of inhibition could play an important role in discerning relevant information from background activity upon physiological sensory stimulation. Furthermore, this could be a site of action for mGlu2 PAMs to modulate cognitive processes.},

abstract = {The mediodorsal thalamus (MD) likely plays an important role in cognition as it receives abundant afferent connections from the amygdala and prefrontal cortex (PFC). Indeed, disturbed activity within the MD is thought to precipitate cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia. As compounds acting at the Group II metabotropic glutamate (mGlu) receptors (subtypes mGlu2/mGlu3) have efficacy in animal models of schizophrenia, we investigated whether a Group II agonist and an mGlu2 positive allosteric modulator (PAM) could modulate MD activity. Extracellular single-unit recordings were made in vivo from MD neurones in anaesthetised rats. Responses were elicited by electrical stimulation of the PFC and/or amygdala, with Group II compounds locally applied as required. The Group II agonist reduced inhibition evoked in the MD: an effect manifested as an increase in short-latency responses, and a decrease in long-latency burst-firing. This disinhibitory action of the Group II receptors in the MD represents a mechanism of potential therapeutic importance as increased inhibition in the MD has been associated with cognitive deficit-onset. Furthermore, as co-application of the mGlu2 PAM did not potentiate the Group II agonist effects in the MD, we suggest that the Group II disinhibitory effect is majority-mediated via mGlu3. This heterogeneity in Group II receptor thalamic physiology bears consequence, as compounds active exclusively at the mGlu2 subtype are unlikely to perturb maladapted MD firing patterns associated with cognitive deficits, with activity at mGlu3 receptors possibly more appropriate. Indeed, polymorphisms in the mGlu3, but not the mGlu2, gene have been detected in patients with schizophrenia.},

The question posed in New Theory is how we perceive by sight spatial features that are not, strictly speaking, visible. Berkeley’s answer is “that the proper objects of vision constitute an universal language of the Author of nature.” For typical humans, this language of vision comes naturally. Berkeley identifies two sorts of objects of vision: primary (light and colors) and secondary (distance, figure, magnitude, and situation). Berkeley also appeals to a third class of a different sort: visible figure, magnitude, and situation, constituting the vocabulary of the language of vision. By considering two perceivers who lack this vocabulary we may better understand this third category and the difference between those who must learn the language of vision and those for whom it is a natural endowment.},

abstract = {1. Calcium currents were recorded with whole-cell voltage-clamp procedures in relay neurones of the rat thalamus which had been acutely isolated by an enzymatic dissociation procedure. 2. Low-threshold and high-threshold Ca2+ currents were elicited by depolarizing voltage steps from holding potentials more negative than -60 mV. A transient current, analogous to the T-current in sensory neurones, was activated at low threshold near -65 mV and was completely inactivating at command steps up to -35 mV. Voltage steps to more depolarized levels activated a high-threshold current that inactivated slowly and incompletely during a 200 ms step depolarization. 3. The high-threshold current contained both non-inactivating and slowly inactivating components which were insensitive and sensitive to holding potential, respectively. 4. A ‘T-type’ current was prominent in relay neurones, in both absolute terms (350 pA peak current average) and in relation to high-threshold currents. The average ratio of maximum transient to maximum sustained current was greater than 2. 5. T-current could be modelled in a manner analogous to that employed for the fast Na+ current underlying action potential generation, using the m3h format. The rate of activation of T-current was voltage dependent, with a time constant (tau m) varying between 8 and 2 ms at command potentials of -60 to -10 mV at 23 degrees C. The rate of inactivation was also voltage dependent, and the time constant tau h varied between 50 and 20 ms over the same voltage range. With command potentials more positive than -35 mV, the inactivation of Ca2+ current could no longer be fitted by a single exponential. 6. Steady-state inactivation of T-current could be well fitted by a Boltzman equation with slope factor of 6.3 and half-inactivated voltage of -83.5 mV. 7. Recovery from inactivation of T-current was not exponential. The major component of recovery (70-80% of total) was not very voltage sensitive at potentials more negative than -90 mV, with tau r of 251 ms at -92 mV and 23 degrees C, compared to 225 ms at -112 mV. A smaller, voltage-sensitive component accounted for the remainder of recovery. 8. All kinetic properties, including rates of activation, inactivation, and recovery from inactivation, as well as the amplitude of T-current, were temperature sensitive with Q10 (temperature coefficient) values of greater than 2.5.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

In the thalamus, local circuit inhibitory interneurons are a class of cells that can release gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) via both axon terminals (termed F1 terminals) as well as presynaptic, vesicle-containing dendrites (termed F2 terminals). For example, in the visual thalamus, these F2 terminals are tightly coupled to the primary sensory afferents (axons of retinogeniculate neurons) that synapse onto thalamocortical relay neurons. The F2 terminals are primarily localized to distal dendrites of the interneurons, and in certain situations the excitation/output of F2 terminals can occur independent of somatic activity within the interneuron thereby allowing these F2 terminals to serve as independent input/output components giving rise to focal inhibition. On the other hand, somatically evoked Na+-dependent action potentials can backpropagate throughout the dendritic arbor of the interneuron. The transient depolarizations, or stronger somatically initiated events (e.g. activation of low threshold calcium transients) can initiate a backpropagating Ca2+-mediated potential that invades the dendritic arbor activating F2 terminals and leading to a global form of inhibition. These distinct types of output (focal versus global) could play an important role in the temporal as well as spatial roles of inhibition that in turn impacts thalamocortical information processing.},

To investigate the role of midlevel visual area V4 in visual surface completion, we used multielectrode arrays to measure spiking responses to two types of visual stimuli: Kanizsa patterns that induce the perception of an illusory surface and physically similar control stimuli that do not. Neurons in V4 exhibited stronger and sometimes rhythmic spiking responses for the illusion-promoting configurations compared with controls. Moreover, this elevated response depended on the precise alignment of the neuron’s peak visual field sensitivity (receptive field focus) with the illusory surface itself. Neurons whose receptive field focus was over adjacent inducing elements, less than 1.5 degrees away, did not show response enhancement to the illusion. Neither receptive field sizes nor fixational eye movements could account for this effect, which was present in both single-unit signals and multiunit activity. These results suggest that the active perceptual completion of surfaces and shapes, which is a fundamental problem in natural visual experience, draws upon the selective enhancement of activity within a distinct subpopulation of neurons in cortical area V4.},

abstract = {The relay of information through thalamus to cortex is dynamically gated, as illustrated by the retinogeniculocortical pathway. Important to this is the inhibitory interneuron in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). For the typical neuron, synaptic information arrives through postsynaptic dendrites and is transmitted by axon terminals. However, the typical thalamic interneuron, in addition to conventional axonal outputs, has distal dendrites that serve both pre- and postsynaptic roles. These dendritic terminals participate in curious and enigmatic triadic arrangements, in which each contacts a relay cell dendrite and is contacted by a glutamatergic retinal terminal that innervates the same relay cell dendrite. Here we show that agonists of the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activate dendritic terminals of interneurons in the absence of action potentials, thereby inhibiting the postsynaptic relay neuron. Somatic recordings from LGN interneurons reveal that there is no response to mGluR agonists, suggesting that their dendritic terminals are electrically isolated from their somata and axons, consistent with anatomical modelling of these cells. Our results offer insight into the functioning of triadic circuitry and indicate that thalamic interneurons can perform independent computations expressed through axonal as opposed to dendritic outputs.},

Several reports indicate that relay neurons may also give rise to axonal collaterals within the lateral geniculate nucleus, constituting another route for feedback or local integration. We now provide new data indicating that collaterals from geniculate relay neurons provide excitatory input to local intralaminar interneurons and that this pathway may serve as a previously unknown means of local feedback inhibition.

abstract = {Inhibition from thalamic interneurons plays a critical role in modulating information transfer between thalamus and neocortex. Interestingly, these neurons yield inhibition via two distinct outputs: presynaptic dendrites that innervate thalamocortical relay neurons and axonal outputs. Since the dendrites of thalamic interneurons are the primary targets of incoming synaptic information, it has been hypothesized that local synaptic input could produce highly focused dendritic output. To gain additional insight into the computational power of these presynaptic dendrites, we have combined two-photon laser scanning microscopy, glutamate uncaging, and whole-cell electrophysiological recordings to locally activate dendritic terminals and study their inhibitory contribution to rat thalamocortical relay neurons. Our findings demonstrate that local dendritic release from thalamic interneurons is controlled locally by AMPA/NMDA receptor-mediated recruitment of L-type calcium channels. Moreover, by mapping these connections with single dendrite resolution we not only found that presynaptic dendrites preferentially target proximal regions, but such actions differ significantly across branches. Furthermore, local stimulation of interneuron dendrites did not result in global excitation, supporting the notion that these interneurons can operate as multiplexors, containing numerous independently operating input-output devices. © 2012 the authors.},

This top-down projection may allow the cortex to regulate sensory processing by modulating the excitability of thalamic cells. Layer 6 corticothalamic neurons monosynaptically excite thalamocortical cells, but also indirectly inhibit them by driving inhibitory cells of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Whether corticothalamic activity generally suppresses or excites the thalamus remains unclear. Here we show that the corticothalamic influence is dynamic, with the excitatory-inhibitory balance shifting in an activity-dependent fashion. During low-frequency activity, corticothalamic effects are mainly suppressive, whereas higher-frequency activity (even a short bout of gamma frequency oscillations) converts the corticothalamic influence to enhancement. The mechanism of this switching depends on distinct forms of short-term synaptic plasticity across multiple corticothalamic circuit components. Our results reveal an activity-dependent mechanism by which corticothalamic neurons can bidirectionally switch the excitability and sensory throughput of the thalamus, possibly to meet changing behavioral demands.},

We have used two-photon laser scanning microscopy coupled with whole-cell recordings to examine calcium dynamics in the neurons of the strategically located thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN). We now report that a single somatic burst discharge evokes large-magnitude calcium responses, via IT, in distal TRN dendrites. The magnitude of the burst-evoked calcium response was larger than those observed in thalamocortical projection neurons under the same conditions. We also demonstrate that direct stimulation of distal TRN dendrites, via focal glutamate application and synaptic activation, can locally activate distal IT, producing a large distal calcium response independent of the soma/proximal dendrites. These findings strongly suggest that distally located IT may function to amplify afferent inputs. Boosting the magnitude ensures integration at the somatic level by compensating for attenuation that would normally occur attributable to passive cable properties. Considering the functional architecture of the TRN, elongated nature of their dendrites, and robust dendritic signaling, these distal dendrites could serve as sites of intense intra-modal/cross-modal integration and/or top-down modulation, leading to focused thalamocortical communication.},

abstract = {Directional tuning for visual noise, bar and single spot stimuli was compared over a wide range of velocities in cells from areas 17 and 18 of the visual cortex in lightly-anaesthetized cats. In each area, S-cells were predominantly insensitive to motion of a field of visual noise. C-cells were more sensitive to noise motion than B-cells, but showed heterogeneity in noise sensitivity, which was associated with other response properties: strongly noise-sensitive C-cells had relatively high spontaneous activity and broad directional tuning, and were predominantly direction-selective and binocularly-driven. Frequently, directional tuning for noise was unimodal at low velocity, but became progressively more bimodal as velocity was increased: a trough of depressed response corresponding to the peak in tuning for the bar separated two progressively more widely disparate preferred directions. In area 18, cells with velocity tuned (VT) functions for bar motion developed bimodal tuning for noise well below the optimum velocity for bar or for noise motion, while velocity high-pass (VHP) cells became progressively more bimodally tuned for noise over a wide range of velocities, in parallel with a steep increase in response to bar and noise motion. A high proportion of VT and VHP cells was bimodally tuned for noise at all velocities, one VHP cell showing two discrete lobes of tuning for noise below the threshold velocity for bar motion. Among cells which remained unimodally tuned for noise, VT and VHP cells in area 18 had radically dissimilar preferred directions for noise and bar motion at all velocities. With the exception of VHP cells, velocity bandpass was higher for noise than for bar motion. These results, together with other novel observations on the modality of tuning for noise in preferred and opposite directions of motion, demonstrate that bimodality of tuning for noise cannot simply be an effect of upper cut-off velocity for bar motion (Movshon et al. 1980; Orban 1984). It is argued that the trough between the lobes of tuning arises through laterally-directed inhibitory convergence from superficial- and deep-layer, large basket cells. In 40% of noise-sensitive cells, tuning for bar motion was broader on the flank closest to the preferred direction for noise and for a moving sport, while some 25% of cells showed variations in tuning for bar motion with velocity, which were associated with velocity-dependent changes in tuning for noise.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

ON pathway block with l-AP-4, the mGluR6 receptor agonist, abolished the S-ON response but spared the LM-OFF response. The isolated LM component showed a center-surround receptive field structure consistent with an input from OFF-center, ON-surround “diffuse” cone bipolar cells. Increasing retinal buffering capacity with HEPES attenuated the LM-ON surround component, consistent with a non-GABAergic outer retina feedback mechanism for the bipolar surround. The GABAa/c receptor antagonist picrotoxin and the glycine receptor antagonist strychnine did not affect chromatic balance or the basic coextensive receptive field structure, suggesting that the LM-OFF field is not generated by an inner retinal inhibitory pathway. We conclude that the opponent S-ON and LM-OFF responses originate from the excitatory receptive field centers of S-ON and LM-OFF cone bipolar cells, and that the LM-OFF- and ON-surrounds of these parallel bipolar inputs largely cancel, explaining the small, spatially coextensive but spectrally antagonistic receptive field structure of the blue-ON ganglion cell.},

abstract = {Directional tuning for motion of a long bar and a spot was compared quantitatively over a wide range of velocities in 23 simple cells of cat striate cortex whose “on” and “off” receptive field subregions had been mapped with optimally oriented, stationary flash-presented bars. Tuning curves were derived using stimuli whose polarity of contrast was appropriate for the dominant receptive field subregion of each cell (i.e. light stimuli for on-subregions and dark stimuli for off-subregions); stimulus sweep was centred accurately on the centre of that subregion. Bar stimuli were of optimal width, and spot diameter was equal to the width of the bars. In all simple cells, preferred axis of motion for a long bar was invariant with velocity, being orthogonal to preferred orientation, as assessed with a stationary flash-presented bar. In 20 of 23 simple cells, preferred axis for spot motion was approximately orthogonal to that for bar motion (i.e., parallel to preferred orientation) at all velocities tested, including those just above threshold for spot stimuli. However, tuning for the spot became sharper as velocity was increased, due to an increase in response to the spot moving along the preferred axis and a decrease in response to spot motion along other axes, including the preferred axis for the bar. Both preferred and upper cut-off velocity were consistently higher for spot than for bar motion. The remaining 3 simple cells showed no response to spot motion at any velocity, and their preferred axis of motion for the shortest bar which evoked a consistent response was the same as the long bar.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

abstract = {1. The visual resolving ability of different types of macaque retinal ganglion cells was estimated at different retinal eccentricities, by measuring the amplitude of modulated responses to black-white gratings of spatial frequencies near the resolution limit for each cell. 2. The resolving ability of tonic, spectrally opponent ganglion cells was usually similar to that of phasic, non-opponent ganglion cells at similar eccentricities, except that at eccentricities greater than 10 deg some tonic ganglion cells with remarkably high resolution (up to ca. 15 cycles/deg) were found. Our cell sample was limited within the central 2 deg of the visual field, however. 3. Only a small proportion of phasic ganglion cells showed an increase of mean firing level to gratings near the resolution limit. The maintained firing of tonic ganglion cells was higher than that of phasic ganglion cells. 4. With red-black or green-black gratings, the resolution of phasic ganglion cells was unaffected. For red or green on-centre ganglion cells, a marked deterioration of resolving ability occurred when the grating was of a colour to which a cell responded poorly (green-black gratings for red on-centre cells, and red-black gratings for green on-centre cells). A slight improvement in resolving ability occurred when the grating was of an excitatory colour. 5. For a sub-sample of cells, we compared resolution limit with centre size as determined from area-threshold curves. For both phasic and tonic ganglion cells, resolution limit (the period length just resolved) was about half the centre diameter, as is the case for cat ganglion cells. This implies that the centre sizes of phasic and tonic monkey ganglion cells are similar at most eccentricities. 6. We attempt to relate these results to primate retinal anatomy and visual resolution, determined behaviourally.},

When the dynamic noise is replaced with a homogenous field, a twinkling after effect (TwAE) is induced exclusively in the location of the former scotoma. We are employing the appearance of the TwAE to perform rapid perimetry in patients with retinal scotomas. To analyze the loci within the visual system and the mechanisms of filling-in and the TwAE, we examined their orientation tuning, inter-ocular transfer, and threshold versus contrast functions by measuring contrast detection thresholds for stimuli presented in areas that were filled-in or contained the TwAE. For filling-in, detection thresholds were narrowly tuned for orientation, transferred interocularly, and rose monotonically with the contrast of a surround pattern. These results indicate that surround suppression and filling-in involve inhibitory processes originating at cortical stages of visual processing. Threshold versus contrast functions were weakly dipper-shaped for the TwAE, did not transfer inter-ocularly, and were not tuned for orientation. These results indicate that the TwAE involves additive noise that is pre-cortical in origin and that it is distinct from filling-in.},

The reduction of target visibility occurring after OSM has been suggested to result from a specific interference with reentrant visual processing while the initial feedforward processing is thought to be left intact. We tested a prediction derived from this hypothesis: the fastest responses, being triggered before the beginning of reentrant processing, should escape the OSM interference. In a saccadic choice reaction time task, which gives access to very early stages of visual processing, target visibility was reduced either by OSM, conventional backward masking, or low stimulus contrast. A general reduction of performance was observed in all three conditions. However, the fastest saccades did not show any sign of interference under either OSM or backward masking, as they did under the low-contrast condition. This finding supports the hypothesis that masking interferes mostly with reentrant processing at later stages, while leaving early feedforward processing largely intact.},

year = {2005}, 
abstract = {Previous studies investigating the response properties of neurons in the primary visual cortex of cats and primates have shown that prolonged exposure to optimally oriented, high-contrast gratings leads to a reduction in responsiveness to subsequently presented test stimuli. We recorded from 119 neurons in cat V1 and V2 and found that in a high proportion of cells contrast adaptation also occurs for gratings oriented orthogonal to a neuron’s preferred orientation, even though this stimulus did not elicit significant increases in spiking activity. Approximately 20% of neurons adapted equally to all orientations tested and a further 46% showed at least some adaptation to orthogonally oriented gratings, while 20% of neurons did not adapt to orthogonal gratings. The magnitude of contrast adaptation was positively correlated with adapting contrast, but was not related to the spiking activity of the cells. Highly direction-selective neurons produced stronger adaptation to orthogonally oriented gratings than other neurons. Orientation-related adaptation was correlated with the rate of change of orientation tuning in consecutive cells along electrode penetrations that travelled parallel to the cortical layers. Non-oriented adaptation was most common in areas where orientation preference changed rapidly, while orientation-selective adaptation was most common in areas where orientation preference changed slowly. A minority of neurons did not show contrast adaptation (14%). No major differences were found between units in different cortical layers, V1 and V2, or between complex and simple cells. The relevance of these findings to the current understanding of adaptation within the context of orientation column architecture is discussed.},

abstract = {Despite popular belief that the primary function of the thalamus is to gate sensory inputs by state, few studies have attempted to directly characterize the efficacy of such gating in the awake, behaving animal. I measured efficacy of retinogeniculate transmission in the awake cat by taking advantage of the fact that many neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are dominated by a single retinal input, and that this input produces a distinct event known as the S-potential. Retinal input failed to produce an LGN action potential half of the time. However, success or failure was powerfully tied to the recency of the S-potential. Short intervals tend to be successful, and long intervals unsuccessful. For 4 of 12 neurons, the probability that a given S-potential could cause a spike exceeded 90% if that S-potential was preceded by an S-potential within the previous 10 msec (100 Hz). Whereas this temporal influence on efficacy has been demonstrated extensively in anesthetized animals, wakefulness is different in several ways. In wakefulness, overall efficacy is better, the duration of facilitating effects are briefer, efficacy of long intervals is superior, and the temporal dependence can be briefly disrupted by altering background illumination. Finally, S-potential amplitude, duration, and even slope are dynamic and systematic within wakefulness; providing further support that the S-potential is the extracellular signature of the retinal EPSP.},

We studied the mechanisms of this selective neuronal activation using a mouse somatosensory thalamocortical preparation. Notably, the greater responsiveness of inhibitory interneurons was not caused by their distinctive intrinsic properties but was instead produced by synaptic mechanisms. Axons from the thalamus made stronger and more frequent excitatory connections onto inhibitory interneurons than onto excitatory cells. Furthermore, circuit dynamics allowed feedforward inhibition to suppress responses in excitatory cells more effectively than in interneurons. Thalamocortical excitatory currents rose quickly in interneurons, allowing them to fire action potentials before significant feedforward inhibition emerged. In contrast, thalamocortical excitatory currents rose slowly in excitatory cells, overlapping with feedforward inhibitory currents that suppress action potentials. These results demonstrate the importance of selective synaptic targeting and precise timing in the initial stages of neocortical processing.},

The characteristics of a transient inward Ca2+ current (IT) underlying low-threshold Ca2+ potentials were studied in projection cells of the cat and rat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in vitro using the single-electrode voltage-clamp technique. 2. In cat LGN slices perfused at 25 degrees C with a solution which included 1 mM-Ca2+ and 3 mM-Mg2+, IT could be evoked by depolarizing voltage steps to -55 mV from a holding potential (Vh) of -95 mV and was abolished by reducing [Ca2+]o from 1 to 0.1 mM. IT was also blocked by 8 mM-Mg2+ and 500 microM-Ni2+, but 500 microM-Cd2+ was a significantly less effective antagonist. 3. The inactivation of IT, which occurred at Vh positive to -65 mV, was removed as Vh approached -100 mV. The process of inactivation removal was also time dependent, with 800-1000 ms needed for total removal. Activation curves for IT showed a threshold of -70 mV and illustrated that IT was extremely voltage sensitive over the voltage range from -65 to -55 mV. 4. The decay phase of IT followed a single-exponential time course with a time constant of decay which was voltage sensitive and ranged from 20 to 100 ms. The mean peak conductance increase associated with IT was 8.4 nS (+/-0.9, S.E.M.). 5. In more ‘physiological’ conditions (35 degrees C and 1.5 mM-Ca2+, 1 mM-Mg2+) the voltage dependence of activation and inactivation were unaffected. However, the development and decay of IT proceeded more rapidly and only 500-600 ms were needed for total removal of inactivation. Under these conditions, the use of voltage ramps showed that depolarization rates of greater than 30 mV/s were necessary for IT activation. 6. The use of multiple voltage-step protocols illustrated that the process of inactivation removal was rapidly reversed by brief returns to a Vh of -50 mV. Furthermore, any delay in IT activation, once the LGN cell membrane potential was in the IT activation range, resulted in a current of reduced amplitude. 7. Although IT in rat LGN cells was briefer and had a shorter latency to peak, it was otherwise similar to that seen in cat LGN cells. 8. The characteristics of IT are very similar to those of the T-type Ca2+ currents of other excitable membranes. The properties of IT are discussed with respect to its role in generating the low-threshold Ca2+ potentials which are central to the oscillatory behaviour of thalamic projection cells.},

abstract = {How specific features in the environment are represented within the brain is an important unanswered question in neuroscience. A subset of retinal neurons, called direction-selective ganglion cells (DSGCs), are specialized for detecting motion along specific axes of the visual field. Despite extensive study of the retinal circuitry that endows DSGCs with their unique tuning properties, their downstream circuitry in the brain and thus their contribution to visual processing has remained unclear. In mice, several different types of DSGCs connect to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), the visual thalamic structure that harbours cortical relay neurons. Whether direction-selective information computed at the level of the retina is routed to cortical circuits and integrated with other visual channels, however, is unknown. Here we show that there is a di-synaptic circuit linking DSGCs with the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) by using viral trans-synaptic circuit mapping and functional imaging of visually driven calcium signals in thalamocortical axons. This circuit pools information from several types of DSGCs, converges in a specialized subdivision of the dLGN, and delivers direction-tuned and orientation-tuned signals to superficial V1. Notably, this circuit is anatomically segregated from the retino-geniculo-cortical pathway carrying non-direction-tuned visual information to deeper layers of V1, such as layer 4. Thus, the mouse harbours several functionally specialized, parallel retino-geniculo-cortical pathways, one of which originates with retinal DSGCs and delivers direction- and orientation-tuned information specifically to the superficial layers of the primary visual cortex. These data provide evidence that direction and orientation selectivity of some V1 neurons may be influenced by the activation of DSGCs.},

This involves extensive corticofugal feedback connections and the interplay of these with the local thalamic circuitry and the other converging inputs. Here, using the feline visual system as the primary model, some of the latest developments in this field are reviewed and placed in the perspective of an integrated view of system function. Cortical feedback mediated by ionotropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, and effects mediated by the neuromodulator nitric oxide, all have a role in integrating the thalamic mechanism into the cortical circuit. The essential point is that the perspective of higher-level sensory mechanisms shifts and modulates the thalamic circuitry in ways that optimize abstraction of a meaningful representation of the external world.

The raster plots of the spike trains often show strong between-trial and within-trial dynamics, yet the standard analysis of these data with the peristimulus time histogram (PSTH) and ANOVA do not consider between-trial dynamics. By itself, the PSTH does not provide a framework for statistical inference. We present a state-space generalized linear model (SS-GLM) to formulate a point process representation of between-trial and within-trial neural spiking dynamics. Our model has the PSTH as a special case. We provide a framework for model estimation, model selection, goodness-of-fit analysis, and inference. In an analysis of hippocampal neural activity recorded from a monkey performing a location-scene association task, we demonstrate how the SS-GLM may be used to answer frequently posed neurophysiological questions including, What is the nature of the between-trial and within-trial task-specific modulation of the neural spiking activity? How can we characterize learning-related neural dynamics? What are the timescales and characteristics of the neuron’s biophysical properties? Our results demonstrate that the SS-GLM is a more informative tool than the PSTH and ANOVA for analysis of multiple trial neural responses and that it provides a quantitative characterization of the between-trial and within-trial neural dynamics readily visible in raster plots, as well as the less apparent fast (1-10 ms), intermediate (11-20 ms), and longer (>20 ms) timescale features of the neuron’s biophysical properties.},

The locus of the neural mechanism mediating this lateral interaction is controversial; neural mechanisms have been posited at the LGN (Kremers et al., 2004) or cortical level (D’Antona & Shevell, 2007). To determine the neural locus, changes in perceived temporal variation were compared with ipsilateral versus contralateral surrounding context. In both cases, a temporally varying central field was viewed within a temporally varying surround; relative phase between center and surround was varied. Perceived modulation depth in the central field depended strongly on the relative phase between center and surround, in both the ipsilateral and contralateral conditions. The results revealed lateral interactions arising from both a weak monocular (plausibly LGN) and a stronger central (cortical) mechanism. The monocular contribution was similar over the range of temporal frequencies tested (approx. 3-12Hz), while the central component showed low-pass temporal-frequency selectivity. Copyright © 2011.

abstract = {A feature of spine synapses is the existence of a neck connecting the synapse on the spine head to the dendritic shaft. As with a cable, spine neck resistance (R(neck)) increases with increasing neck length and is inversely proportional to the cross-sectional area of the neck. A synaptic current entering a spine with a high R(neck) will lead to greater local depolarization in the spine head than would a similar input applied to a spine with a lower R(neck). This could make spines with high R(neck) more sensitive to plastic changes since voltage sensitive conductances, such as N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) channels can be more easily activated. This hypothesis was tested using serial section electron microscopic reconstructions of thalamocortical spine synapses and spine necks located on spiny stellate cells and corticothalamic cells from area 17 of cats. Thalamic axons and corticothalamic neurons were labeled by injections of the tracer biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of anesthetized cats and spiny stellates were filled intracellularly in vivo with horseradish peroxidase. Twenty-eight labeled spines that formed synapses with dLGN boutons were collected from three spiny stellate and four corticothalamic cells and reconstructed in 3D from serial electron micrographs. Spine length, spine diameter, and the area of the postsynaptic density were measured from the 3D reconstructions and R(neck) of the spine was estimated. No correlation was found between the postsynaptic density size and the estimated spine R(neck). This suggests that forms of plasticity that lead to larger synapses are independent of spine neck resistance.},

abstract = {The connection between the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and area 17 of the cat is a classical model for studying thalamocortical relations. We investigated the proportion of asymmetric synapses in layer 4 of area 17 of cats formed by axons of the dLGN, because this is an important morphological parameter in understanding the impact of dLGN axons on their target neurons. Although the present consensus is that this proportion is small, the exact percentage remains in doubt. Most previous work estimated that the thalamus contributes less than 10% of excitatory synapses in layer 4, but one estimate was as high as 28%. Two issues contribute to these widely different estimates, one being the tracers used, the other being the use of biased stereological approaches. We have addressed both of these issues. Thalamic axons were labeled in vivo by injections of biotinylated dextran amine into the A lamina of the dLGN of anesthetized cats. After processing, the brain was cut serially and prepared for light and electron microscopy. The density of asymmetric synapses in the neuropil and the density of synapses formed by labeled dLGN boutons were measured by using an unbiased sampling method called the physical disector. Our counts indicate that, in the fixed cat brain, there are 5.9 x 10(8) +/- 0.9 x 10(8) asymmetric synapses per cubic millimeter of layer 4 in area 17, and the dLGN input provides only 6% of all asymmetric synapses in layer 4. The vast majority of synapses of layer 4 probably originate from other neurons in area 17.},

In mammals, recordings from bipolar cells are rare and have not revealed a clear surround. Here we report center-surround receptive fields of identified cone bipolar cells in the macaque monkey retina. In the peripheral retina, cone bipolar cell nuclei were labeled in vitro with diamidino-phenylindole (DAPI), targeted for recording under microscopic control, and anatomically identified by intracellular staining. Identified cells included ‘diffuse’ bipolar cells, which contact multiple cones, and ‘midget’ bipolar cells, which contact a single cone. Responses to flickering spots and annuli revealed a clear surround: both hyperpolarizing (OFF) and depolarizing (ON) cells responded with reversed polarity to annular stimuli. Center and surround dimensions were calculated for 12 bipolar cells from the spatial frequency response to drifting, sinusoidal luminance modulated gratings. The frequency response was bandpass and well fit by a difference of Gaussians receptive field model. Center diameters were all two to three times larger than known dendritic tree diameters for both diffuse and midget bipolar cells in the retinal periphery. In one instance intracellular staining revealed tracer spread between a recorded cell and its nearest neighbors, suggesting that homotypic electrical coupling may contribute to receptive field center size. Surrounds were around ten times larger in diameter than centers and in most cases the ratio of center to surround strength was approximately 1. We suggest that the center-surround receptive fields of the major primate ganglion cell types are established at the bipolar cell, probably by the circuitry of the outer retina.},

In the present study, we used electrical microstimulation in the visual cortex of monkeys to test the hypothesis that cortico-cortical feedback plays a role in visual awareness. We investigated the interactions between the primary visual cortex (V1) and area V4 by applying microstimulation in both cortical areas at various delays. We report that the monkeys detected the phosphenes produced by V1 microstimulation but subthreshold V4 microstimulation did not influence V1 phosphene detection thresholds. A second experiment examined the influence of V4 microstimulation on the monkeys’ ability to detect the dimming of one of three peripheral visual stimuli. Again, microstimulation of a group of V4 neurons failed to modulate the monkeys’ perception of a stimulus in their receptive field. We conclude that conditions exist where microstimulation of area V4 has only a limited influence on visual perception.},

Using electrophysiological mappings, we probed the modality preference to auditory and visual stimuli of neurons in the superior temporal association cortex of nonhuman primates. We found that neurons preferring the same modality (auditory or visual) often co-occur in close spatial proximity or occur intermingled with bimodal neurons. Neurons preferring different modalities, in contrast, occur spatially separated. This organization at the scale of individual neurons leads to extended patches of same modality preference when analyzed at the scale of millimeters, revealing larger-scale regions that preferentially respond to the same modality. In addition, we find that neurons exhibiting signs of multisensory interactions, such as superadditive or subadditive response summation, also occur in spatial clusters. Together, these results reveal a spatial organization of modality preferences in a higher association cortex and lend support to the notion that topographical organizations might serve as a general principle of integrating information within and across the sensory modalities.},

abstract = {Optogenetics is a recently developed method in which neurons are genetically modified to express membrane proteins sensitive to light, enabling precisely targeted control of neural activity [1-3]. The temporal and spatial precision afforded by neural stimulation by light holds promise as a powerful alternative to current methods of neural control, which rely predominantly on electrical and pharmacological methods, in both research and clinical settings [4, 5]. Although the optogenetic approach has been widely used in rodent and other small animal models to study neural circuitry [6-8], its functional application in primate models has proven more difficult. In contrast to the relatively large literature on the effects of cortical electrical microstimulation in perceptual and decision-making tasks [9-13], previous studies of optogenetic stimulation in primates have not demonstrated its utility in similar paradigms [14-18]. In this study, we directly compare the effects of optogenetic activation and electrical microstimulation in the lateral intraparietal area during a visuospatial discrimination task. We observed significant and predictable biases in visual attention in response to both forms of stimulation that are consistent with the experimental modulation of a visual salience map. Our results demonstrate the power of optogenetics as a viable alternative to electrical microstimulation for the precise dissection of the cortical pathways of high-level processes in the primate brain.},

Despite some reported successes by a few groups, many still find it difficult to develop a reliable way to transduce cells in the monkey brain and subsequently monitor light-induced neuronal activity. Here, we describe a methodology that we have developed and successfully deployed on a regular basis with multiple monkeys. All devices and accessories are easy to obtain and results using these have been proven to be highly replicable. We developed the “in-chair” viral injection system and used tapered and thinner fibers for optical stimulation, which significantly improved the efficacy and reduced tissue damage. With these methods, we have successfully transduced cells in multiple monkeys in both deep and shallow cortical areas. We could reliably obtain neural modulation for months after injection, and no light-induced artifacts were observed during recordings. Further experiments using these methods have shown that optogenetic stimulation can be used to bias spatial attention in a visual choice discrimination task in a way comparable to electrical microstimulation, which demonstrates the potential use of our methods in both fundamental research and clinical applications.},

abstract = {I consider how structure is derived from texture containing changes in orientation over space, and propose that multi-local orientation variance (the average orientation variance across a series of discrete images locales) is an estimate of the degree of organization that is useful both for spatial scale selection and for discriminating structure from noise. The oriented textures used in this paper are Glass patterns, which contain structure at a narrow range of scales. The effect of adding noise to Glass patterns, on a structure versus noise task (Maloney et al., 1987), is compared to discrimination based on orientation variance and template matching (i.e. having prior knowledge of the target’s orientation structure). At all but very low densities, the variance model accounts well for human data. Next, both models’ estimates of tolerable orientation variance are shown to be broadly consistent with human discrimination of texture from noise. However, neither model can account for subjects’ lower tolerance to noise for translational patterns than other (e.g. rotational) patterns. Finally, to investigate how well these structural measures preserve local orientation discontinuities, I show that the presence of a patch of unstructured dots embedded in a Glass pattern produces a change in multi-local orientation variance that is sufficient to account for human detection (Hel Or and Zucker, 1989). Together, these data suggest that simple orientation statistics could drive a range of ‘texture tasks’, although the dependency of noise resistance on the pattern type (rotation, translation, etc.) remains to be accounted for Type: JOURNAL ARTICLE Language: Eng},

Singer, Proc. Nat]. Acad. Sci. USA 86, 1698 (1989)]. Although this hypothesis remains controversial, a number of recent psychophysical studies have suggested that temporal correlation among features can indeed promote perceptual grouping. In particular, subjects are better at detecting extended visual contours embedded within a field of distractor elements when a small delay is present between a cycling presentation of the contour and the background [Nature 394, 179 (1988)]. We have replicated this finding and examined three potentially confounding factors. First, we controlled local density and used more curved contours composed of bandpass elements to confirm that the effect was associated with contour integration and not with the operation of coarse-scale spatial filters. Second, we minimized the effects of saccadic eye movements (which could combine with the flicker of the asynchronous display to introduce motion cues at the contour location) both by using a fixation marker that was visible only when observers made a saccade (allowing them to reject these trials) and by retinally stabilizing the stimulus. We report that eye movements contribute to the effect. Third, we asked if either visible persistence or transients at the onset and the offset of the asynchronous stimuli might contribute to the effect. We report that the effect is largely abolished by the inclusion of prestimulus and poststimulus masks and is entirely abolished by ramping the contrast of the stimulus on and off. Neither ramping, masking, nor stabilization should specifically disrupt a contour-binding scheme based on temporal synchrony, and we conclude that it is the transient component at the onset and the offset of these stimuli that is responsible for the reported advantage for asynchronous presentation.},

This illusion, the Craik-Cornsweet-O’Brien (CCOB) effect, has been taken as evidence for a low-level ‘filling-in’ mechanism subserving lightness perception. Here, we present evidence that the mechanism responsible for the CCOB effect operates not via propagation of a neural signal across space but by amplification of the low spatial frequency (SF) structure of the image. We develop a simple computational model that relies on the statistics of natural scenes actively to reconstruct the image that is most likely to have caused an observed series of responses across SF channels. This principle is tested psychophysically by deriving classification images (CIs) for subjects’ discrimination of the contrast polarity of CCOB stimuli masked with noise. CIs resemble ‘filled-in’ stimuli; i.e. observers rely on portions of the stimuli that contain no information per se but that correspond closely to the reported perceptual completion. As predicted by the model, the filling-in process is contingent on the presence of appropriate low SF structure.},

We manipulated the apparent separation of objects using the illusory shifts in perceived location that arise from local motion to determine if crowding depends on physical or perceived location. Flickering Gabor targets displayed between either flickering or drifting flankers were used to (a) quantify the perceived target-flanker separation and (b) measure discrimination of the target orientation or spatial frequency as a function of physical target-flanker separation. Relative to performance with flickering targets, we find that flankers drifting away from the target improve discrimination, while those drifting toward the target degrade it. When plotted as a function of perceived separation across conditions, the data collapse onto a single function indicating that it is perceived and not physical location that determines the magnitude of visual crowding. There was no measurable spatial distortion of the target that could explain the effects. This suggests that crowding operates predominantly in extrastriate visual cortex and not in early visual areas where the response of neurons is retinotopically aligned with the physical position of a stimulus.},

abstract = {A recent computational theory suggests that visual processing in the retina and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) serves to recode information into an efficient form (Atick and Redlich, 1990). Information theoretic analysis showed that the representation of visual information at the level of the photoreceptors is inefficient, primarily attributable to a high degree of spatial and temporal correlation in natural scenes. It was predicted, therefore, that the retina and the LGN should recode this signal into a decorrelated form or, equivalently, into a signal with a “white” spatial and temporal power spectrum. In the present study, we tested directly the prediction that visual processing at the level of the LGN temporarily whitens the natural visual input. We recorded the responses of individual neurons in the LGN of the cat to natural, time-varying images (movies) and, as a control, to white-noise stimuli. Although there is substantial temporal correlation in natural inputs (Dong and Atick, 1995b), we found that the power spectra of LGN responses were essentially white. Between 3 and 15 Hz, the power of the responses had an average variation of only +/-10.3%. Thus, the signals that the LGN relays to visual cortex are temporarily decorrelated. Furthermore, the responses of X-cells to natural inputs can be well predicted from their responses to white-noise inputs. We therefore conclude that whitening of natural inputs can be explained largely by the linear filtering properties (Enroth-Cugell and Robson, 1966). Our results suggest that the early visual pathway is well adapted for efficient coding of information in the natural visual environment, in agreement with the prediction of the computational theory.},

abstract = {In primary sensory and motor cortex of adult animals, alteration of input from the periphery leads to changes in cortical topography. These changes can be attributed to processes that are intrinsic to the cortex, or can be inherited from alterations occurring at stages of sensory processing that are antecedent to the primary sensory cortical areas. In the visual system, focal binocular retinal lesions initially silence an area of cortex that represents the region of retina destroyed, but over a period of months this area recovers visually driven activity. The retinotopic map in the recovered area is altered, shifting its representation to the portion of retina immediately surrounding the lesion. This effectively shrinks the representation of the lesioned area of retina, and expands the representation of the lesion surround. To determine the loci along the visual pathway at which the reorganization takes place, we compared the course of topographic alterations in the primary visual cortex and dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of cats and monkeys. At a time when the cortical reorganization is complete, the silent area of LGN persists, indicating that changes in cortical topography are due to alterations that are intrinsic to the cortex. To explore the participation of thalamocortical afferents in the reorganization, we injected a series of retrogradely transported fluorescent tracers into reorganized and surrounding cortex of each animal. Our results show that the thalamocortical arbors do not extend beyond their normal lateral territory and that this physical dimension is insufficient to account for the reorganization. We suggest that the long-range intrinsic horizontal connections are a likely source of visual input into the reorganized cortical area.},

abstract = {One of the largest influences on dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) activity comes from interneurons, which use the neurotransmitter γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA). It is well established that X retinogeniculate terminals contact interneurons and thalamocortical cells in complex synaptic arrangements known as glomeruli. However, there is little anatomical evidence for the involvement of dLGN interneurons in the Y pathway. To determine whether Y retinogeniculate axons contact interneurons, we injected the superior colliculus (SC) with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA) to backfill retinal axons, which also project to the SC. Within the A lamina of the dLGN, this BDA labeling allowed us to distinguish Y retinogeniculate axons from X retinogeniculate axons, which do not project to the SC. In BDA-labeled tissue prepared for electron microscopic analysis, we subsequently used postembedding immunocytochemical staining for GABA to distinguish interneurons from thalamocortical cells. We found that the majority of profiles postsynaptic to Y retinal axons were GABA-negative dendrites of thalamocortical cells (117/200 or 58.5%). The remainder (83/200 or 41.5%) were GABA-positive dendrites, many of which contained vesicles (59/200 or 29.5%). Thus, Y retinogeniculate axons do contact interneurons. However, these contacts differed from X retinogeniculate axons, in that triadic arrangements were rare. This indicates that the X and Y pathways participate in unique circuitries but that interneurons are involved in the modulation of both pathways. J. Comp.

abstract = {Neurons in cortical area V4 respond selectively to complex visual patterns such as curved contours and non-Cartesian gratings. Most previous experiments in V4 have measured responses to small, idiosyncratic stimulus sets and no single functional model yet accounts for all of the disparate results. We propose that one model, the spectral receptive field (SRF), can explain many observations of selectivity in V4. The SRF describes tuning in terms of the orientation and spatial frequency spectrum and can, in principle, predict the response to any visual stimulus. We estimated SRFs for neurons in V4 of awake primates by linearized reverse correlation of responses to a large set of natural images. We find that V4 neurons have large orientation and spatial frequency bandwidth and often bimodal orientation tuning. For comparison, we estimated SRFs for neurons in primary visual cortex (V1). Consistent with previous observations, we find that V1 neurons have narrower bandwidth than that of V4. To determine whether estimated SRFs can account for previous observations of selectivity, we used them to predict responses to Cartesian gratings, non-Cartesian gratings, natural images, and curved contours. Based on these predictions, we find that the majority of neurons in V1 are selective for Cartesian gratings, whereas the majority of V4 neurons are selective for non-Cartesian gratings or natural images. The SRF describes visual tuning properties with a second-order nonlinear model. These results support the hypothesis that a second-order model is sufficient to describe the general mechanisms mediating shape selectivity in area V4.},

abstract = {Irregularity of firing in spike trains has been associated with coding processes and information transfer or alternatively treated as noise. Previous studies of irregularity have mainly used the coefficient of variation (CV) of the interspike interval distribution. Proper estimation of CV requires a constant underlying firing rate, a condition that most experimental situations do not fulfill either within or across trials. Here we introduce a novel irregularity metric based on the ratio of adjacent intervals in the spike train. The new metric is not affected by firing rate and is very localized in time, so that it can be used to examine the time course of irregularity relative to an alignment marker. We characterized properties of the new metric with simulated spike trains of known characteristics, and then applied it to data recorded from 108 singleeurons in the motor cortex of two monkeys during performance of a precision grip task. Fifty six cells were antidromically identified as pyramidal tract neurons (PTNs). Sixty one cells (30 PTNs) exhibited significant temporal modulation of their irregularity during task performance with the contralateral hand. The irregularity modulations generally differed in sign and latency from the modulations of firing rate. High irregularity tended to occur during the task phases requiring the most detailed control of movement, whereas neural firing became more regular during the steady hold phase. Such irregularity modulation could have important consequences for the response of downstream neurons, and may provide insight into the nature of the cortical code.},

This device consists of an aluminum halo with four titanium skull pins offset from the halo by aluminum posts. The titanium pins insert onto small segments of cranially reinforcing titanium plate, which are attached to the skull with titanium cortex screws. The surgery involves four scalp incisions, placement of the reinforcing plates, insertion of the pins for attachment of the halo, and incision closure. After the halo is attached, the animal’s head can be fixed to a primate chair using a custom-built attachment arm that provides three degrees of adjustability for proper positioning during behavioral tasks. We have installed this device on two Macaque monkeys weighing 7 and 10kg. The halos have been in place on these animals for up to 8 months without signs of discomfort or loss of fixation. Using this method of head fixation, we have been able to track the animals’ eye positions with an accuracy of less than two visual degrees while they perform behavioral tasks.},

abstract = {A common problem in tasks involving the integration of spatial information from multiple senses, or in sensorimotor coordination, is that different modalities represent space in different frames of reference. Coordinate transformations between different reference frames are therefore required. One way to achieve this relies on the encoding of spatial information with population codes. The set of network responses to stimuli in different locations (tuning curves) constitutes a set of basis functions that can be combined linearly through weighted synaptic connections to approximate nonlinear transformations of the input variables. The question then arises: how is the appropriate synaptic connectivity obtained? Here we show that a network of spiking neurons can learn the coordinate transformation from one frame of reference to another, with connectivity that develops continuously in an unsupervised manner, based only on the correlations available in the environment and with a biologically realistic plasticity mechanism (spike timing-dependent plasticity).},

Each ensemble is a group of biological integrate-and-fire spiking neurons, with probabilistic interconnections between groups. An analogy is drawn in which each individual processing unit of an artificial neural network corresponds to a neuronal group in a biological model. The activation value of a unit in the artificial neural network corresponds to the fraction of active neurons, synchronously firing, in a biological neuronal group. Weights of the artificial neural network correspond to the product of the interconnection density between groups, the group size of the presynaptic group, and the postsynaptic potential heights in the synchronous group model. All three of these parameters can modulate connection strengths between neuronal groups in the synchronous group models. We give an example of nonlinear classification (XOR) and a function approximation example in which the capability of the artificial neural network can be captured by a neural network model with biological integrate-and-fire neurons configured as a network of synchronously firing ensembles of such neurons. We point out that the general function approximation capability proven for feedforward artificial neural networks appears to be approximated by networks of neuronal groups that fire in synchrony, where the groups comprise integrate-and-fire neurons. We discuss the advantages of this type of model for biological systems, its possible learning mechanisms, and the associated timing relationships.},

A comparison of the RSVP technique using 100 ms presentations with that using a longer duration showed that shape preference can be determined with RSVP. Using relatively complex shapes that vary along relatively simple shape dimensions, we found that the large majority of neurons preferred extremes of the shape configuration, extending the results of a previous study using simpler shapes and a standard testing paradigm (Kayaert et al. 2005). A population analysis of the neuronal responses demonstrated that, in general, IT neurons can represent the similarities among the shapes at an ordinal level, extending a previous study that used a smaller number of shapes and a categorization task (Op de Beeck et al. 2001). However, the same analysis showed that IT neurons do not faithfully represent the physical similarities among the shapes. The responses to the two-part shapes could be predicted, virtually perfectly, from the average of the responses to the respective two parts presented in isolation. We also showed that IT neurons adapt to the stimulus distribution statistics. The neural shape discrimination improved when a shape set with a narrower stimulus range was presented, suggesting that the tuning of IT neurons is not static but adapts to the stimulus distribution statistics, at least when stimulated at a high rate with a restricted set of stimuli.},

We presented human volunteers with short sequences of repeated faces and measured brain activity using fMRI. In an independently defined face-responsive extrastriate region, the response of each voxel to repetition (RS vs. RE) was consistent across scanner runs, and multivoxel patterns for both RS and RE voxels were stable. Moreover, RS and RE voxels responded to repetition with dissociable latencies and exhibited different patterns of connectivity with lower and higher visual regions. Computational simulations demonstrated that these effects must be due to differences in repetition sensitivity, and not feature selectivity. These findings establish that 2 classes of repetition responses coexist within 1 visual region and support models acknowledging this distinction, such as predictive coding models where perception requires the computation of both predictions (which are enhanced by repetition) and prediction errors (which are suppressed by repetition).},

abstract = {Transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) can be applied to occipital cortex to abolish (conscious) perception of visual stimuli. TMS research has revealed several time windows of masking relative to visual stimulus onset, most consistently a time window around 100ms post-stimulus. However, the exact nature of visual processing in this ‘classical’ time window, e.g. whether it represents the feedforward processing of the visual information, or rather a feedback projection from higher visual areas, remains unclear. Here, we used TMS to mask in the same participants two types of stimuli of different complexities (orientation Gratings and Faces) over different time windows. Interestingly, the masking functions were not the same for both stimulus types. We found an earlier peak masking latency for orientation stimuli, and a slower recovery for Faces. In a second, follow-up experiment, we superimposed both types of stimuli to create one composite stimulus set. Depending on the instruction, participants could then perform orientation or face discrimination tasks on the exact same stimuli. In addition, for each participant, stimuli were calibrated to equate task difficulties. The peak masking latency was now identical for both tasks, but the masking function revealed again a slower recovery during the face discrimination task, suggesting top-down (recurrent) effects in the second half of the masking function. Hence, rather than this masking window reflecting either feedforward or feedback processing, the early part of what is traditionally considered one masking window may reflect feedforward processing, while the latter part may already reflect recurrent processing. These findings shed new light on recurrent models of vision and related theoretical accounts of visual awareness.},

When a sensory stimulus is presented, many cortical areas are activated, but how does the representation of a sensory stimulus evolve in time and across cortical areas during a perceptual judgment? We investigated this question by analyzing the responses from single neurons, recorded in several cortical areas of parietal and frontal lobes, while trained monkeys reported the presence or absence of a mechanical vibration of varying amplitude applied to the skin of one fingertip. Here we show that the strength of the covariations between neuronal activity and perceptual judgments progressively increases across cortical areas as the activity is transmitted from the primary somatosensory cortex to the premotor areas of the frontal lobe. This finding suggests that the neuronal correlates of subjective sensory experience gradually build up across somatosensory areas of the parietal lobe and premotor cortices of the frontal lobe.},

After injections of latex beads into the dLGN, sections of the brainstem were treated immunohistochemically for choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), serotonin (Ser), tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), and dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (DBH). Essentially, six regions in the brainstem contained retrogradely labeled cells: the superior colliculus, the parabigeminal nucleus, the dorsal raphe nuclei, the parabrachial area of the central tegmental field, the marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, and the nucleus coeruleus. Furthermore, isolated retrogradely labeled cells were present in the central nucleus of the raphe, in the cuneiform nucleus, and in the periaqueductal gray. Most serotoninergic double-labeled cells were found in the medial and lateral divisions of the dorsal raphe nuclei, but a few were also present in the central nucleus of the raphe. In the sections immunostained for ChAT, double-labeled cells were located in the central tegmental field, in the marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, and in the nucleus coeruleus. In the sections treated for TH and DBH, double-labeled cells showed a similar distribution, and like the ChAT(+) cells, they were located mainly in the central tegmental field, in the marginal nucleus of the brachium conjunctivum, and in the nucleus coeruleus. In these regions the cholinergic and noradrenergic cells that projected to the lateral geniculate nucleus were intermingled, the former predominating rostrally and the latter caudally. The majority of retrogradely labeled cells were located in the region of the central tegmental field in the vicinity of the brachium conjunctivum, and most of these cells were also ChAT-immunoreactive. We, therefore, conclude that the cholinergic projection is the most important of the central core projections ascending to the dLGN.},

abstract = {Our visual percepts are not fully determined by physical stimulus inputs. Thus, in visual illusions such as the Kanizsa figure, inducers presented at the corners allow one to perceive the bounding contours of the figure in the absence of luminance-defined borders. We examined the discrimination of the curvature of these illusory contours that pass across retinal scotomas caused by macular degeneration. In contrast with previous studies with normal-sighted subjects that showed no perception of these illusory contours in the region of physiological scotomas at the optic nerve head, we demonstrated perfect discrimination of the curvature of the illusory contours over the pathological retinal scotoma. The illusion occurred despite the large scar around the macular lesion, strongly reducing discrimination of whether the inducer openings were acute or obtuse and suggesting that the coarse information in the inducers (low spatial frequency) sufficed. The result that subjective contours can pass through the pathological retinal scotoma suggests that the visual cortex, despite the loss of bottom-up input, can use low-spatial frequency information from the inducers to form a neural representation of new complex geometrical shapes inside the scotoma.},

abstract = {It is widely assumed that monkeys see a stranger in the mirror, whereas apes and humans recognize themselves. In this study, we question the former assumption by using a detailed comparison of how monkeys respond to mirrors versus live individuals. Eight adult female and six adult male brown capuchin monkeys (Cebus apella) were exposed twice to three conditions: (i) a familiar same-sex partner, (ii) an unfamiliar same-sex partner, and (iii) a mirror. Females showed more eye contact and friendly behavior and fewer signs of anxiety in front of a mirror than they did when exposed to an unfamiliar partner. Males showed greater ambiguity, but they too reacted differently to mirrors and strangers. Discrimination between conditions was immediate, and blind coders were able to tell the difference between monkeys under the three conditions. Capuchins thus seem to recognize their reflection in the mirror as special, and they may not confuse it with an actual conspecific. Possibly, they reach a level of self-other distinction intermediate between seeing their mirror image as other and recognizing it as self.},

This effect could be augmented by boosting attention. Furthermore, the frequency distribution of filling-in response times for attended figures could be predicted by multiplying the frequencies of response times for unattended figures with a constant. We propose that, after failure of figure-ground segregation, the neural interpolation processes that produce perceptual filling-in are enhanced in attended figure regions. As filling-in processes are involved in surface perception, the present study demonstrates that even very early visual processes are subject to modulation by cognitive factors.},

abstract = {Saccades may not always wait for the completion of the perceptual analysis. By taking advantage of a motion-induced illusion of position and of the spontaneous scatter of saccade latency, we showed that in normal observers, regular saccades (latency, 200 ms) were accurately directed to the target, whereas at higher latencies, saccades were increasingly biased by visual motion until they reflected the perceptual illusion. We reconstructed the time course of saccadic direction coding and identified an early phase in which saccades are mostly predictive (latencies less than 100 ms), followed by a phase in which saccades are guided by the target position signal (latencies 100‚Äì250 ms), and a later phase associated with the buildup of mislocalization (250‚Äì450 ms). This transient dissociation between action and perception indicates that seeing and looking are based on asynchronous processes, possibly because of independent thresholds for saccades and perceptual localization. The metrics of a saccade would then reflect the evolution of cortical visual signals from a predictive state to a perceptual state, passing through an intermediate visuomotor state. If saccades occur during the visuomotor state, they escape the tricks of perception.},

This reduction could offer important insights into the nature of feedback computations within the human visual system; however, the properties of this response reduction have not yet been investigated in detail. Here we replicate this reduced V1 response, but find that the modulation in V1 (and V2) to the perceived organization of the input is not specific to the retinotopic location at which the sensory input from that stimulus is represented. Instead, we find a response modulation that is equally evident across the primary visual cortex. Thus in contradiction to some models of hierarchical predictive coding, the perception of an organized Gestalt causes a broad feedback effect that does not act specifically on the part of the retinotopic map representing the sensory input.},

abstract = {Many studies have characterized the brain as an efficient coding system (Olshausen and Field, 1996). A common claim in this “efficient coding” approach is that the brain has evolved to code sensory information in an efficient way by using information-processing strategies optimized to the statistics of the perceptual environment. An influential theoretical and computational framework, closely related to efficient coding, is predictive coding. This framework provides a novel means of understanding the interactions between distinct brain areas. Predictive coding posits that the brain actively predicts upcoming sensory input rather than passively registering it. Predictive coding is efficient in the sense that the brain does not need to maintain multiple versions of the same information at different levels of the processing hierarchy. Indeed, activation in early sensory areas no longer represents sensory information per se, but only that part of the input that has not been successfully predicted by higher level areas. The activity in lower level areas can therefore be considered an “error signal” that updates the predictions at higher areas and guides learning.
One articulate example of predictive coding is the model of Rao and Ballard (1999). In this model, predictions generated at higher levels are used to “explain away” lower level representations that are compatible with the higher level interpretation. The explaining away component of predictive coding has a remarkable consequence: predictability reduces activity in early areas through feedback from higher level areas. This might seem counter intuitive. Indeed, due to the ambiguity of sensory input and the limited reliability of neural responses, one might expect feedback to enhance early information that is in agreement with higher level representations. However, two recent studies published in The Journal of Neuroscience seem to provide fMRI evidence consistent with this notion of explaining away.
Focusing on the primary visual cortex, Alink et al. (2010) observed a lower blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal for predictable compared with unpredictable stimuli. These authors exploited an apparent motion illusion, in which the alternation between a stationary bar at the top and at the bottom of the screen leads to the illusory perception of a moving bar between the two physically presented stimuli. Alink et al. (2010) measured the neural response to an additional bar at one location along the path of the illusory moving bar. The timing of this additional bar was manipulated such that it was presented at a time point that was either consistent with the motion illusion (and thus predictable) or at an inconsistent (unpredictable) time point. The lower BOLD response for the predictable stimulus (in contrast to the unpredictable stimulus) seems to be in line with the explaining away notion of predictive coding: predictable representations at lower levels are actively suppressed by feedback from higher levels.
The lower BOLD response for the predictable versus unpredictable bar was observed in a region of V1 that retinotopically corresponded to the location at which this bar appeared. Because this region did not directly respond to the “inducing” bars, it seems logical to conclude that predictability effects at this location must reflect feedback from higher levels with larger receptive fields. Alink et al. (2010) acknowledge, however, that BOLD signal changes cannot be taken as direct evidence for feedback effects, and they highlight that it is not possible to rule out a role of lateral interactions within V1.
The increased neural response to the unpredictable stimulus could be thought to reflect an increased allocation of attention to a surprising stimulus. In a separate psychophysical experiment however, Alink et al. (2010) found that detectability rates were in fact higher for the predictable stimulus. This behavioral result rules out any straightforward explanation of the changes in fMRI response in terms of an increased allocation of attention to the unpredictable stimulus.
It is worth considering how Alink et al. (2010) operationalized predictability, because in their experiment the unpredictable stimulus was, in fact, always presented at the same location and at a constant delay. Thus, although the timing of the unpredictable stimulus was inconsistent with the illusory motion (and therefore unpredictable with respect to the brain’s long term assumptions about moving stimuli), it could still be considered predictable in the context of the experiment. If predictive coding is to provide a flexible means of learning about the statistics of one’s environment, one might expect the brain to be sensitive to such short-term (within experiment) contingencies.
Evidence for a sensitivity to short-term contingencies is in fact provided by another paper recently published in The Journal of Neuroscience. den Ouden et al. (2010) found that when one of two tones consistently preceded the visual onset of either a face or a house, activation in brain areas recruited when processing these stimulus types [fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA), respectively] was reduced. Importantly, this reduction occurred even though the association between the tone and stimulus type was artificial and the probability with which a given tone would be followed by a given stimulus changed across the experiment. Furthermore, participants were not explicitly informed when these probability rates would change; they were simply informed that the probabilistic relations between the auditory cues and the target would change over the experiment. Nevertheless, den Ouden et al. (2010) found a negative correlation between the neural response to a particular stimulus type and the predictability of that stimulus type. Thus, den Ouden et al.’s (2010)results seem to corroborate Alink et al.’s (2010) finding of reduced activity levels in sensory areas in the context of predictable stimulus contingencies, but demonstrate this effect for an arbitrary contingency developed over a short time scale.
In addition to this sensory sensitivity to predictability, for faces in FFA and houses in PPA, den Ouden et al. (2010) reported higher levels of activation in the putamen whenever a tone was not followed by the stimulus type it predicted. The putamen therefore seemed to signal a generic (nonstimulus specific) “prediction error,” which was elicited for both face and house stimuli. den Ouden et al. (2010) used dynamic causal modeling to suggest that activation in this area gated the connection between perceptual (FFA/PPA) and motor areas (responsible for generating the participants’ response). It appears, therefore, as if the error detection in the putamen ensures that, whenever predictions are not met, the standard perceptual resources used in decoding a particular stimulus have a stronger influence on response selection. This mechanism could play a role in changing connectivity weights that might mediate long-term learning.
Viewed in parallel, Alink et al. (2010) and den Ouden et al. (2010) provide evidence that across different time scales, experimental contexts, and levels of the visual hierarchy, the brain is not only highly sensitive to predictability, but that this predictability can lead to a reduction of activation in sensory areas. This finding is consistent with Rao and Ballard’s (1999)hypothesis that predictions in higher level areas are fed back and compared with incoming sensory signals, such that lower areas come to represent the discrepancy, or error signal, and not the stimulus per se. However, it is important to remember that the fMRI BOLD signal is an indirect measure of the underlying neural representation, where each voxel can reflect an average of >100,000 neurons. Indeed, reflecting upon similar reduced-activation levels in early visual areas in the context of perceptual grouping, Murray et al. (2004) highlight that, although a reduction in activation is consistent with an overall reduction in the strength of that representation, it could also be the case that the reduction reflects a sharpened tuning for predictable stimuli that lead to them being represented more efficiently (i.e., a lower average activation with a higher signal-to-noise ratio).
Thus, although the BOLD signal reduction found in sensory areas by Alink et al. (2010) and den Ouden et al. (2010) could well be described in terms of a higher level of representation influencing the activations at a lower level, it is not possible to conclude whether predictable stimuli are explained away at low levels and represented at higher levels, as predicted by the predictive coding framework of Rao and Ballard, or whether the representation of predictable stimuli is adjusted at the lower level itself. The latter possibility is consistent with a recent study (Nienborg and Cumming, 2009) suggesting that efficient decoding mechanisms may be implemented at the level of sensory neurons through top-down changes in neuronal gain. Distinguishing between these “fine-tuning” and explaining-away explanations at different levels of the visual hierarchy will be an important goal of future research.
In summary, Alink et al. (2010) and den Ouden et al. (2010) highlight different ways in which the predictability of sensory input alters the processing of those stimuli by the brain. Alink et al. (2010) show that even at the first stage of cortical visual information processing, predictable and unpredictable stimuli are processed differently. den Ouden et al. (2010) not only highlight how this effect of predictability can manifest at higher stages of visual information processing but also demonstrate that it can develop for arbitrary contingencies over short time scales. Furthermore, den Ouden et al. (2010) provide evidence for a more generic error-signaling system, contingent on the putamen, that appears to act to functionally increase the connection between sensory and motor responses when our predictions are not met, providing a link between predictive coding and learning. Further experiments however, ideally combining fMRI and single-cell electrophysiology (Tsao et al., 2006), are needed to identify whether the reductions in BOLD signal really do reflect a predictive coding-based explaining away or a fine tuning of sensory representations.

abstract = {Psychology moved beyond the stimulus response mapping of behaviorism by adopting an information processing framework. This shift from behavioral to cognitive science was partly inspired by work demonstrating that the concept of information could be defined and quantified (Shannon, 1948). This transition developed further from cognitive science into cognitive neuroscience, in an attempt to measure information in the brain. In the cognitive neurosciences, however, the term information is often used without a clear definition. This paper will argue that, if the formulation proposed by Shannon is applied to modern neuroimaging, then numerous results would be interpreted differently. More specifically, we argue that much modern cognitive neuroscience implicitly focuses on the question of how we can interpret the activations we record in the brain (experimenter-as-receiver), rather than on the core question of how the rest of the brain can interpret those activations (cortex-as-receiver). A clearer focus on whether activations recorded via neuroimaging can actually act as information in the brain would not only change how findings are interpreted but should also change the direction of empirical research in cognitive neuroscience.},

abstract = {1. The response to an optimally oriented stimulus of both simple and complex cells in the cat’s striate visual cortex (area 17) can be suppressed by the superposition of an orthogonally oriented drifting grating. This effect is referred to as cross-orientation suppression. We have examined the spatial organization and tuning characteristics of this suppressive effect with the use of extracellular recording techniques. 2. For a total of 75 neurons, we have measured the size of each cell’s excitatory receptive field by use of rectangular patches of drifting sinusoidal gratings presented at the optimal orientation and spatial frequency. The length and width of these grating patches are varied independently. Receptive-field length and width are determined from the dimensions of the smallest grating patch required to elicit a maximal response. 3. The extent of the area from which cross-orientation suppression originates has been measured in an analogous manner. Each neuron is excited by a patch of drifting grating the same size as the receptive field. The response to this stimulus is modulated by a superimposed patch of grating having an orthogonal orientation. After selecting the spatial frequency that produces maximal suppression, the response of each cell is examined as a function of the length and width of the orthogonal (suppressive) grating patch. Results from 29 cells show that the dimensions of the orthogonal grating patch required to elicit maximal suppression are similar to, or smaller than, the dimensions of the excitatory receptive field. Thus cross-orientation suppression originates from within the receptive field. 4. For some cells the spatial frequency tuning of the suppressive effect is much broader than the spatial frequency tuning for excitation. In these cases it is possible to find a spatial frequency that produces suppression but not excitation. With the use of a suppressive stimulus having this spatial frequency, we examined the strength of suppression as a function of orientation for 11 cells. These tests show that suppression occurs at all orientations, including the preferred orientation for excitation. In some cases, suppression is somewhat stronger at the preferred orientation for excitation than at any other orientation. 5. For 12 cells we varied the relative spatial phase between the optimally oriented and orthogonal gratings. In all cases the magnitude of suppression is largely independent of the relative spatial phase. 6. For three binocular cells we examined whether the suppressive effect of a grating oriented orthogonal to the optimum could be mediated dichoptically.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {1. The classically defined receptive field of a visual neuron is the area of visual space over which the cell responds to visual stimuli. It is well established, however, that the discharge produced by an optimal stimulus can be modulated by the presence of additional stimuli that by themselves do not produce any response. This study examines inhibitory influences that originate from areas located outside of the classical (i.e., excitatory) receptive field. Previous work has shown that for some cells the response to a properly oriented bar of light becomes attenuated when the bar extends beyond the receptive field, a phenomenon known as end-inhibition (or length tuning). Analogously, it has been shown that increasing the number of cycles of a drifting grating stimulus may also inhibit the firing of some cells, an effect known as side-inhibition (or width tuning). Very little information is available, however, about the relationship between end- and side-inhibition. We have examined the spatial organization and tuning characteristics of these inhibitory effects by recording extracellularly from single neurons in the cat’s striate cortex (Area 17). 2. For each cortical neuron, length and width tuning curves were obtained with the use of rectangular patches of drifting sinusoidal gratings that have variable length and width. Results from 82 cells show that the strengths of end- and side-inhibition tend to be correlated. Most cells that exhibit clear end-inhibition also show a similar degree of side-inhibition. For these cells, the excitatory receptive field is surrounded on all sides by inhibitory zones. Some cells exhibit only end- or side-inhibition, but not both. Data for 28 binocular cells show that length and width tuning curves for the dominant and nondominant eyes tend to be closely matched. 3. We also measured tuning characteristics of end- and side-inhibition. To obtain these data, the excitatory receptive field was stimulated with a grating patch having optimal orientation, spatial frequency, and size, whereas the end- or side-inhibitory regions were stimulated with patches of gratings that had a variable parameter (such as orientation). Results show that end- and side-inhibition tend to be strongest at the orientation and spatial frequency that yield maximal excitation. However, orientation and spatial frequency tuning curves for inhibition are considerably broader than those for excitation, suggesting that inhibition is mediated by a pool of neurons.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Differential pairing between visual input evoked in a fixed position of the RF and preset levels of postsynaptic firing (imposed iontophoretically) were used alternately to boost the ‘on’ (or ‘off’) response to a ‘high’ level of firing (S+ pairing), and to reduce the opponent response (respectively ‘off’ or ‘on’) in the same position to a ‘low’ level (S- pairing). This associative procedure was repeated 50-100 times at a low temporal frequency (0.1-0.15 s-1). 3. Long-lasting modifications of the ratio of ‘on-off’ responses, measured in the paired position or integrated across the whole RF, were found in 44 % of the conditioned neurons (17/39), and in most cases this favoured the S+ paired characteristic. The amplitude change was on average half of that imposed during pairing. Comparable proportions of modified cells were obtained in ‘simple’ (13/27) and ‘complex’ (4/12) RFs, both in adult cats (4/11) and in kittens within the critical period (13/28). 4. The spatial selectivity of the pairing effects was studied by pseudorandomly stimulating both paired and spatially distinct unpaired positions within the RF. Most modifications were observed in the paired position (for 88 % of successful pairings). 5. In some cells (n = 13), a fixed delay pairing procedure was applied, in which the temporal phase of the onset of the current pulse was shifted by a few hundred milliseconds from the presentation or offset of the visual stimulus. Consecutive effects were observed in 4/13 cells, which retained the temporal pattern of activity imposed during pairing for 5-40 min. They were expressed in the paired region only. 6. The demonstration of long-lasting adaptive changes in the ratio of ‘on’ and ‘off’ responses, expressed in localized subregions of the RF, leads us to suggest that simple and complex RF organizations might be two stable functional states derived from a common connectivity scheme.},

abstract = {GABAergic neurons of the thalamic reticular nucleus (nRt) provide thalamocortical relay neurons with feedback inhibition that influences sensory processing and thalamocortical rhythm generation. Mutual interactions between reticular neurons coordinate oscillatory activities developed within the network during normal sleep and in absence epilepsy, but the chemical versus electrical nature of these connections and their functional influence remain controversial. Here, we investigated the incidence and spatial extent of intra-nRt connectivity in vitro in horizontal and coronal thalamic slices from rat. Laser scanning photostimulation activated presynaptic nRt cells during patch-clamp recordings of postsynaptic neurons. Photolysis of caged glutamate evoked GABAergic IPSCs and/or depolarizing events (spikelets, mediated via electrical coupling) in a large proportion of neurons, thus indicating connectivity with presynaptic cell(s). Synaptic inputs were organized along the major axis of the nucleus in the same orientation as, but commonly exceeding the extent of, dendritic arborization of the postsynaptic neuron. In the anteroposterior (horizontal) plane, chemical connectivity had higher incidence (60% of recorded neurons vs 40% in vertical plane) and longer spatial extent, whereas in the dorsoventral (vertical) plane, electrical coupling dominated (47% incidence vs 37% in horizontal plane) and was more widely distributed. These data demonstrate that both electrical and chemical synapses are prominent within nRt and suggest different roles for the two types of connections. We thus propose that, along the vertical plane, electrical connectivity will promote coordinated rhythmic activity of sleep and/or thalamocortical epilepsy, whereas along the horizontal plane, chemical connectivity will oppose widespread thalamocortical synchronization and modulate sensory throughput.},

To solve the retina, we need to understand how the circuits pre- synaptic to its output neurons, ganglion cells, divide the visual scene into parallel representations to be assembled and interpreted by the brain. This requires identifying the component interneurons and understanding how their intrinsic properties and synapses generate circuit behaviors. Because the cellular composition and fundamental properties of the retina are shared across species, basic mechanisms studied in the genetically modifiable mouse retina apply to primate vision. We propose that the apparent complexity of retinal computation derives from a straightforward mechanism—a dynamic balance of synaptic excitation and inhibition regulated by use-dependent synaptic depression—applied differentially to the parallel pathways that feed ganglion cells.},

The linear mechanism has been attributed to input from bipolar cells, and the nonlinear mechanism has been attributed to input from a class of amacrine cells whose nonlinear “subunits” extend across the linear receptive field and beyond. However, the central component of the nonlinear mechanism could in theory be driven by bipolar input if that input were rectified. Recording intracellularly from the Y-cell in guinea pig retina, we blocked the peripheral component of the nonlinear mechanism with tetrodotoxin and found the remaining nonlinear receptive field to be precisely co-spatial with the central component of the linear receptive field. Both linear and nonlinear mechanisms were caused by an excitatory postsynaptic potential that reversed near 0 mV. The nonlinear mechanism depended neither on acetylcholine nor on feedback involving GABA or glycine. Thus the central components of the ganglion cell’s linear and nonlinear mechanisms are apparently driven by synapses from the same rectifying bipolar cell.},

abstract = {Thalamic relay cells fire bursts of action potentials. Once a long hyperpolarization “primes” (deinactivates) the T-type calcium channel, a depolarizing input will “trigger” a calcium spike with a burst of action potentials. During sleep, bursts are frequent, rhythmic, and nonvisual. Bursts have been observed in alert animals, and burst timing is known to carry visual information under light anesthesia. We extend this finding by showing that bursts without visual triggers are rare. Nevertheless, if the channel were primed at random with respect to the stimulus, then bursts would have the same visual significance as single spikes. We find, however, that visual signals influence when the channel is primed. First, natural time-varying stimuli evoke more bursts than white noise. Second, specific visual stimuli reproducibly elicit bursts, whereas others reliably elicit single spikes. Therefore, visual information is encoded by the selective tagging of some responses as bursts. The visual information attributable to visual priming (as distinct from the information attributable to visual triggering of the bursts) was two bits per burst on average. Although bursts are reportedly rare in alert animals, this must be investigated as a function of visual stimulus. Moreover, we propose methods to measure the extent of both visual triggering and visual priming of bursts. Whether or not bursts are rare, our methods could help determine whether bursts in alert animals carry a distinct visual signal.},

abstract = {The sudden displacement of the retinal image during a saccade raises the visual threshold of human observers to foveal stimuli. The fall in visual sensitivity observed during this phenomenon, known as saccadic suppression, seems to occur very early in the visual processing chain. The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is a likely locus for the multiple retinal and extraretinal interactions occurring during saccadic eye movements, therefore we used the responses of relay cells of adult cats to simulate a psychophysical experiment. We first measured the responses of X and Y relay cells (27 X and 13 Y) to central spots of optimal size and different contrasts. The spots were presented either alone or time locked with the rapid movement of a large, high-contrast peripheral pattern, referred to as shift. We measured the percentage of trials on which the relay cell fired more spikes when the spot (contrast: 0.03-1.0) was present than when it was absent. In experiments with human observers the task was to indicate, by a keypress, which of two otherwise identical temporal intervals contained the spot. The shift reduces the sensitivity (raises the contrast threshold) of neurones in the cat relay cells to brief, stationary targets presented to the receptive-field center. The suppression of visual sensitivity is significantly greater in Y cells than in X cells (average sensitivity ratios 5.6 +/- 5.4 in Y cells, 1.59 +/- 0.9 in X cells: P < 0.001, U test). The shift also reduces the sensitivity of human observers to the same target. This suggests that the LGN is a potential locus for the modulation of visual responses that leads to saccadic suppression.},

However, Y cells, largely because they preferred lower spatial frequencies, preferred higher drift velocities than X cells. 7.

abstract = {The discharges of single neurones in the parvocellular and magnocellular laminae of the macaque’s lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.) were recorded with glass-insulated tungsten micro-electrodes. Linearity of spatial summation was examined using the test devised by Hochstein & Shapley (1976). 2 of 272 parvocellular units and 6 of 105 magnocellular units showed clearly non-linear spatial summation. A quantitative index of non-linearity did not suggest the existence of a distinct ‘non-linear’ class of magnocellular unit. Spatial contrast sensitivity to moving gratings was measured by a tracking procedure in which contrast was adjusted to elicit a reliable modulation of discharge. With the exception of cells that were driven by blue-sensitive cones, measurements of contrast sensitivity did not reveal distinct subgroups of parvocellular units. All had low sensitivity, and those with receptive fields in the fovea could resolve spatial frequencies of up to 40 cycles deg-1. Magnocellular units had substantially higher sensitivity, but poorer spatial resolution. The higher sensitivities of magnocellular units led to their giving saturated responses to stimuli of high contrast. Responses of parvocellular units were rarely saturated by any stimulus. At any one eccentricity the receptive fields of parvocellular units had smaller centres than did those of magnocellular units. Receptive fields of magnocellular units driven by the ipsilateral eye had larger receptive fields than did those driven by the contralateral eye. Parvocellular units were most sensitive to stimuli modulated at temporal frequencies close to 10 Hz; magnocellular units to stimuli modulated at frequencies nearer 20 Hz. The loss of sensitivity as temporal frequency fell below optimum was more marked in magnocellular than parvocellular units. Changes in temporal frequency altered the shapes of the spatial contrast sensitivity curves of both parvocellular and magnocellular units. These changes could be explained by supposing that centre and surround have different temporal properties, and that the surround is relatively less sensitive to higher temporal frequencies.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a new technique for the analysis of the chromatic properties of neurones, and applies it to cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.) of macaque. The method exploits the fact that for any cell that combines linearly the signals from cones there is a restricted set of lights to which it is equally sensitive, and whose members can be exchanged for one another without evoking a response. Stimuli are represented in a three-dimensional space defined by an axis along which only luminance varies, without change in chromaticity, a ‘constant B’ axis along which chromaticity varies without changing the excitation of blue-sensitive (B) cones, a ‘constant R & G’ axis along which chromaticity varies without change in the excitation of red-sensitive (R) or green-sensitive (G) cones. The orthogonal axes intersect at a white point. The isoluminant plane defined by the intersection of the ‘constant B’ and ‘constant R & G’ axes contains lights that vary only in chromaticity. In polar coordinates the constant B axis is assigned the azimuth 0-180 deg, and the constant R & G axis the azimuth 90-270 deg. Luminance is expressed as elevation above or below the isoluminant plane (-90 to +90 deg). For any cell that combines cone signals linearly, there is one plane in this space, passing through the white point, that contains all lights that can be exchanged silently. The position of this ‘null plane’ provides the ‘signature’ of the cell, and is specified by its azimuth (the direction in which it intersects the isoluminant plane of the stimulus space) and its elevation (its angle of inclination to the isoluminant plane). A colour television receiver was used to produce sinusoidal gratings whose chromaticity and luminance could be modulated along any vector passing through the white point in the space described. The spatial and temporal frequencies of modulation could be varied over a large range. When stimulated by patterns of low spatial and low temporal frequency, two groups of cells in the parvocellular laminae of the l.g.n. were distinguished by the locations of their null planes. The null planes of the larger group were narrowly distributed about an azimuth of 92.6 deg and more broadly about an elevation of 51.5 deg, which suggests that they receive opposed, but not equally balanced, inputs from only R and G cones. These we call R-G cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Computational models were used to investigate the bursting properties of thalamic relay and reticular neurons. These two types of thalamic cells differ fundamentally in their ability to generate bursts following either excitatory or inhibitory events. Bursts generated with excitatory inputs in relay cells required a high degree of convergence from excitatory inputs, whereas moderate excitation drove burst discharges in reticular neurons from hyperpolarized levels. The opposite holds for inhibitory rebound bursts, which are more difficult to evoke in reticular neurons than in relay cells. The differences between the reticular neurons and thalamocortical neurons were due to different kinetics of the T-current, different electrotonic properties and different distribution patterns of the T-current in the two cell types. These properties enable the cortex to control the sensitivity of the thalamus to inputs and are also important for understanding states such as absence seizures.},

abstract = {Early studies have shown that spindle oscillations are generated in the thalamus and are synchronized over wide cortical territories. More recent experiments have shown that this large-scale synchrony depends on the integrity of corticothalamic feedback. Previously proposed mechanisms emphasized exclusively intrathalamic mechanisms to generate the synchrony of these oscillations. In the present paper, we propose a cellular mechanism in which the synchrony is dependent of a mutual interaction between cortex and thalamus. This cellular mechanism is tested by computational models consisting of pyramidal cells, interneurons, thalamic reticular (RE) and thalamocortical (TC) relay cells, on the basis of voltage-clamp data on intrinsic currents and synaptic receptors present in the circuitry. The model suggests that corticothalamic feedback must operate on the thalamus mainly through excitation of GABAergic RE neurons, therefore recruiting relay cells essentially through inhibition and rebound. We provide experimental evidence for such dominant inhibition in the lateral posterior nucleus. In these conditions, the model shows that cortical discharges optimally evoked thalamic oscillations. This feature is essential to the present cellular mechanism and is also consistently observed experimentally. The model further shows that, with this type of corticothalamic feedback, cortical discharges recruited large areas of the thalamus because of the divergent cortex-to-RE and RE-to-TC axonal projections. Consequently, the thalamocortical network generated patterns of oscillations and synchrony similar to in vivo recordings. The model also emphasizes the important role of the modulation of the Ih current by calcium in TC cells. This property conferred a relative refractoriness to the entire network, a feature also observed experimentally, as we show here. Further, the same property accounted for various spatiotemporal features of oscillations, such as systematic propagation after low-intensity cortical stimulation, local oscillations, and more generally, a high variability in the patterns of spontaneous oscillations, similar to in vivo recordings. We propose that the large-scale synchrony of spindle oscillations in vivo is the result of thalamocortical interactions in which the corticothalamic feedback acts predominantly through the RE nucleus. Several predictions are suggested to test the validity of this model.},

Such in vivo studies offer the tantalizing possibility of uncovering the underlying principles and mechanisms of neural interactions within the natural context of fully intact biological networks. This unit focuses on strategies for overcoming the specific technical challenges posed by in vivo whole-cell recording. A straightforward procedure is described for obtaining whole-cell records from the cortex of the anesthetized rat; this procedure has also been applied successfully to awake animals and other rodent species with minor modifications.},

In the auditory cortex, however, response variability can be very low. We have used in vivo whole cell patch-clamp methods to study the trial-to-trial variability of the subthreshold fluctuations in membrane potential underlying tone-evoked responses in the auditory cortex of anesthetized rats. Using methods adapted from classical quantal analysis, we partitioned this subthreshold variability into a private component (which includes synaptic, thermal, and other sources local to the recorded cell) and a shared component arising from network interactions. Here we report that this private component is remarkably small, usually about 1-3 mV, as quantified by the variance divided by the mean of the ensemble of tone-evoked response heights. The shared component can be much larger, and shows more heterogeneity across the population, ranging from about 0 to 10 mV. The remarkable fact that, at least 5 synapses from the auditory periphery, this variability remains so small raises the possibility that the intervening neural circuitry is organized so as to prevent private noise from accumulating as neural signals propagate to the cortex.},

abstract = {Many models of cortical dynamics have focused on the high-firing regime, in which neurons are driven near their maximal rate. Here we consider the responses of neurons in auditory cortex under typical low-firing rate conditions, when stimuli have not been optimized to drive neurons maximally. We used whole-cell patch-clamp recording in vivo to measure subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations in rat primary auditory cortex in both the anesthetized and awake preparations. By analyzing the subthreshold membrane potential dynamics on single trials, we made inferences about the underlying population activity. We found that, during both spontaneous and evoked responses, membrane potential was highly non-Gaussian, with dynamics consisting of occasional large excursions (sometimes tens of millivolts), much larger than the small fluctuations predicted by most random walk models that predict a Gaussian distribution of membrane potential. Thus, presynaptic inputs under these conditions are organized into quiescent periods punctuated by brief highly synchronous volleys, or “bumps.” These bumps were typically so brief that they could not be well characterized as “up states” or “down states.” We estimate that hundreds, perhaps thousands, of presynaptic neurons participate in the largest volleys. These dynamics suggest a computational scheme in which spike timing is controlled by concerted firing among input neurons rather than by small fluctuations in a sea of background activity.},

However, much of the experimental evidence supporting this view was obtained in the visual cortex. We have, therefore, assessed trial-to-trial variability in the auditory cortex of the rat. To ensure single-unit isolation, we used cell-attached recording. Tone-evoked responses were usually transient, often consisting of, on average, only a single spike per stimulus. Surprisingly, the majority of responses were not just transient, but were also binary, consisting of 0 or 1 action potentials, but not more, in response to each stimulus; several dramatic examples consisted of exactly one spike on 100% of trials, with no trial-to-trial variability in spike count. The variability of such binary responses differs from comparably transient responses recorded in visual cortical areas such as area MT, and represent the lowest trial-to-trial variability mathematically possible for responses of a given firing rate. Our study thus establishes for the first time that transient responses in auditory cortex can be described as a binary process, rather than as a highly variable Poisson process. These results demonstrate that cortical architecture can support a more precise control of spike number than was previously recognized, and they suggest a re-evaluation of models of cortical processing that assume noisiness to be an inevitable feature of cortical codes.},

Relative to stimulation with drifting gratings, counterphase modulation reduces the responses of M- cells in a band around 25 Hz, producing a “notch” in the temporal modulation transfer function (tMTF). The notch is prominent in nearly every M- cell with little variation in the temporal frequency at which it is deepest. The machinery responsible for the notch lies mostly outside the classical linear center. Directly driving the notching mechanism with annular gratings evokes no linear response but elicits a second harmonic (F2) modulation of the discharge accompanied by a drop in the mean discharge (F0). Analysis of the S- potential, which reveals inputs from ganglion cells, shows that 1) tMTFs of the afferent retinal ganglion cells are not notched and 2) during stimulation with annular gratings, the second harmonic component is present, but the drop in the F0 is largely absent from the responses of parasol ganglion cells. These results suggest that the notch is caused by the combined action of the linear response and the second harmonic response, both inherited from retina, and a suppression that originates after the retina. Our results reveal a distinctive signal transformation in the LGN and they show that nearly every M- cell exhibits a spatial nonlinearity like that observed in Y cells of the cat.},

At all levels of the gustatory neuraxis, however, there are many cells that are broadly tuned, i.e., they respond well to each of the basic taste qualities (sweet, sour, salty, and bitter). Although it might seem that this broad tuning precludes a major role for these cells in representing taste space, here we show the opposite--namely, that the tastant-specific temporal aspects (firing rate envelope and spike timing) of their responses enable each cell to represent the entire stimulus domain. Specifically, we recorded the response patterns of cells in the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) to representatives of four basic taste qualities and their binary mixtures. We analyzed the temporal aspects of these responses, and used their similarities and differences to construct the taste space represented by each neuron. We found that for the more broadly tuned neurons in the NTS, the taste space is a systematic representation of the entire taste domain. That is, the taste space of these broadly tuned neurons is three dimensional, with basic taste qualities widely separated and binary mixtures placed close to their components. Further, the way that taste quality is represented by the firing rate envelope is consistent across the population of cells. Thus, the temporal characteristics of responses in the population of NTS neurons, especially those that are more broadly tuned, produce a comprehensive and logical representation of the taste world.},

We examined the effect of free viewing on IT neuronal responses in monkeys engaged in a form-recognition task. By making small, real-time stimulus adjustments, we produced nearly identically retinal stimulation during controlled and free viewing. Nearly 90% of neuronal responses were unaffected by free viewing, and average stimulus selectivity was unchanged. Thus, neuronal representations that likely underlie form recognition are virtually unaltered by free viewing.},

year = {2003}, 
abstract = {Visual object recognition is computationally difficult because changes in an object’s position, distance, pose, or setting may cause it to produce a different retinal image on each encounter. To robustly recognize objects, the primate brain must have mechanisms to compensate for these variations. Although these mechanisms are poorly understood, it is thought that they elaborate neuronal representations in the inferotemporal cortex that are sensitive to object form but substantially invariant to other image variations. This study examines this hypothesis for image variation resulting from changes in object position. We studied the effect of small differences (+/-1.5 degrees) in the retinal position of small (0.6 degrees wide) visual forms on both the behavior of monkeys trained to identify those forms and the responses of 146 anterior IT (AIT) neurons collected during that behavior. Behavioral accuracy and speed were largely unaffected by these small changes in position. Consistent with previous studies, many AIT responses were highly selective for the forms. However, AIT responses showed far greater sensitivity to retinal position than predicted from their reported receptive field (RF) sizes. The median AIT neuron showed a approximately 60% response decrease between positions within +/-1.5 degrees of the center of gaze, and 52% of neurons were unresponsive to one or more of these positions. Consistent with previous studies, each neuron’s rank order of target preferences was largely unaffected across position changes. Although we have not yet determined the conditions necessary to observe this marked position sensitivity in AIT responses, we rule out effects of spatial-frequency content, eye movements, and failures to include the RF center. To reconcile this observation with previous studies, we hypothesize that either AIT position sensitivity strongly depends on object size or that position sensitivity is sharpened by extensive visual experience at fixed retinal positions or by the presence of flanking distractors.},

This method of testing significance is more general than the currently available methods since under our null hypothesis we do not assume that the spiking processes of different neurons are independent. The structure of our null hypothesis also allows us to rank order the detected patterns. We demonstrate our method on simulated spike trains.},

abstract = {Several lines of evidence indicate that the processing of motion by the primate visual system continues even when a moving stimulus differs from its surroundings by color alone. To illuminate the mechanisms by which our visual system uses color as a token for motion correspondence, we have developed an “apparent motion” paradigm in which red/green sine-wave gratings undergo reversal of chromatic contrast sign each time they are displaced in a particular direction. Under such conditions, correspondence based upon conservation of chromatic sign conflicts with correspondence based upon chromatically-defined borders. When these heterochromatic stimuli also possess luminance modulation, motion is always perceived in the direction in which the sign of luminance contrast is preserved. At isoluminance, however, two very different chromatic influences on motion detection are revealed. First, when stimuli undergo small spatial displacements, motion is perceived in the direction of the nearest chromatically-defined border even when the sign of chromatic contrast at that border alternates over time. Under these conditions, motion detectors apparently exploit information about image borders defined by color while sacrificing information about the colors that make up those borders. By contrast, when spatial displacement is large, motion is more apt to be perceived in the direction for which sign of chromatic contrast is preserved. In this instance, information about the polarity of chromatic contrast facilitates motion detection. These results suggest that chromatic signals contributing to motion detection are of two distinct types. This conclusion has implications for the degree of crosstalk between magnocellular and parvocellular processing streams in the primate visual system and it reinforces our understanding of how image features affect the way we see things move.},

Gamma-band synchronization has been proposed to be a mechanism for the functional integration of neural populations that together form a transitory, large-scale, task- and/or percept-specific network. The operation of this mechanism in the context of attention orienting entails that cortical regions representing attended locations should show more gamma-band synchronization with other cortical areas than would those representing unattended locations. This increased synchronization should be apparent in the same time frame as that of the deployment of attention to a particular location. In order to observe this effect, we made electroencephalogram recordings while subjects attended to one side or the other of the visual field (which we confirmed by event-related potential analysis) and calculated phase-locking statistics between the signals recorded at relevant electrode pairs. We observed increased gamma-band phase synchronization between visual cortex contralateral to the attended location and other, widespread, cortical areas approximately 240‚Äì380 ms after the directional cue was presented, confirming the prediction of a large-scale gamma synchronous network oriented to the cued location.},

Large-scale microelectrode recording devices, with dozens to hundreds of microelectrodes capable of simultaneously recording from nearly as many cortical and subcortical areas, provide a potential way to minimize these tradeoffs. However, placing hundreds of microelectrodes into a behaving animal is a highly risky and technically challenging endeavor that has only been pursued by a few groups.

Here, we investigate the relationship between alpha fluctuations and spiking responses to visual stimuli across cortical layers. Using laminar probes in macaque V1, we show that neural firing couples with the phase of alpha fluctuations, and that magnitude of this coupling is particularly pronounced during visual stimulation. The strongest modulation of spiking activity was observed in layers 2/3. Alpha-spike coupling and current source density analysis pointed to an infragranular origin of the alpha fluctuations. Taken together, these results indicate that ongoing infragranular alpha-range fluctuations in V1 play a role in regulating columnar visual activity.},

abstract = {Experimental data are analysed statistically to allow us to draw conclusions from a limited set of measurements. The hard fact is that we can never be certain that measurements from a sample will exactly reflect the properties of the entire group of possible candidates available to be studied (although using a sample is often the only practical thing to do). It’s possible that some scientists are not even clear that the word ‘sample’ has a special meaning in statistics, or understand the importance of taking an unbiased sample. Some may consider a ‘sample’ to be something like the first ten leeches that come out of a jar! If we have taken care to obtain a truly random or a representative sample from a large number of possible individuals, we can use this unbiased sample to judge the possibility that our observations support a particular hypothesis. Statistical analysis allows the strength of this possibility to be estimated. Since it’s not completely certain, the converse of this likelihood shows the uncertainty that remains. Scientists are better at dealing with ‘uncertainty’ than the popular press, but many are still swayed by ‘magical’ cut-off values for P values, such as 0.05, below which hypotheses are considered (supposedly) proven, forgetting that probability is measured on a continuum and is not dichotomous. Words can betray, and often cannot provide sufficient nuances to describe effects which can be indistinct or fuzzy (Pocock & Ware, 2009). Indeed, many of the words we use such as significance, likelihood and probability, and conclusions such as ‘no effect’, should be used guardedly to avoid mistakes. There are also differences of opinion between statisticians: some statisticians are more theoretical and others more pragmatic. Some of the different approaches used for statistical inference are hard for the novice to grasp. Although a full mathematical understanding is not necessary for most researchers, it is vital to have sufficient understanding of the basic principles behind the statistical approaches adopted. This avoids merely treating statistical tests as if they were a fire appliance, to pick up when smoking data need to be dealt with, and vaguely hoping you have got the correct type. Better to know how the data should be properly analysed (as it is to know which extinguisher works best). The wrong statistical approach could be like using water on an electrical fire!},

abstract = {This short editorial is the first of a planned series to guide the handling of data from laboratory experiments. We hope that authors (and editors) may find this helpful in writing and assessing future journal articles.

It’s clear that data handling in science needs to be improved, if only from the number of attempts that have been made to rectify the problem. Books, articles and websites give copious words of advice, too numerous to cite. Many are indeed helpful, but others are often too dense and discouraging for the non-specialist. Often the advice is ‘too general in nature, too limited in scope, and too specialized in vocabulary to be useful to most authors and editors’ (Lang & Secic, 2010). On one occasion the American Physiological Society gave specific advice (Curran-Everett & Benos, 2004). When the guidelines were followed up, the results were found to be mixed, with some praise but also criticism and controversy, with little overall effect on the quality of publication (Curran-Everett & Benos, 2007). In general, encouraged by the slow but substantial change that has occurred in medical journals, there seems to be a mood to improve, although changes in basic science journals have been slow, if they have occurred at all. Comparison of basic science reports with clinical studies is not flattering (Watters & Goodman, 1999).

We are well aware that advice alone has been ineffective. We could easily list a comprehensive set of guidelines, which would probably suffer a fate similar to those that have gone before. In contrast we hope that by keeping the articles in this series short and focused, they will offer advice that is digestible and palatable. They may even attract readers who find such topics difficult and unappealing when they are presented in larger portions. We shall try to avoid technical terms and complicated maths.

Much advice starts with a suggestion that one should consult a statistician. Considering the time and cost of some experiments, this would often be prudent. Admittedly statisticians are a rare breed and can be hard to find. Often when the data are given to a statistician there is a problem with them that might have been avoided if the consultation had occurred at the start. Fisher once said: ‘To consult a statistician after an experiment is finished is often merely to ask him to conduct a post-mortem examination. He can perhaps say what the experiment died of’ (Fisher, 1938). In practice, it’s likely that basic scientists do not know that they should seek advice beforehand, as they may not be sure what they will find, or they consider that what they will find will be easily described and analysed with a simple toolbox of tests. On occasion, physiological studies resemble a random walk through a series of ‘what ifs?’ and ‘how can we prove this mechanism?’ stages that may leave a statistician searching for a single testable hypothesis. When basic scientists do have data to analyse, they may think the exciting part of the study is done. They look around for an easy way to deal with their data, and often ask someone with possibly more experience but probably no more training what to do. The advice is often ‘well, this is what I did …’, almost designed to sustain the status quo and perhaps perpetuate error.

A recent article repeated the often heard advice: ‘The choice of how to express the data is very important and should not be made solely on the basis of habit or convention. Always inspect the data in its raw form’ (Lew, 2007).


Data presentation to reveal the distribution of data
• 
Display data in their raw form.
• 
A dot plot is a good start.
• 
‘Dynamite plunger plots’ conceal data.
• 
Check the pattern of distribution of the values.
• 
Take care when samples are small.
• 
Choose appropriate measures of precision or dispersion.
In this editorial, we argue that we should use methods of data presentation that allow inspection, not concealment, of the nature of the distribution of the data. This is a first important step in good statistical practice. The next step is entirely dependent on the distribution of the data, so it is important that this is verified rather than just assumed.

In many journals, including The Journal of Physiology, the current convention used to illustrate a set of data is to use a solid vertical bar, with a T at the top to indicate the precision of the estimate: this is often called the ‘dynamite plunger plot’. Most often, the bar indicates a mean value and the plunger the standard error of the mean (sem). In most circumstances this convention is unnecessary, and can conceal important features of the data.

Is there a better way? To some extent this depends on what the figure intends to show. However, in many cases this concept of ‘what do we wish to show?’ may not even have been considered: the author’s aim is often just to present ‘a result’ without first considering the underlying implication or characteristics of this ‘result’. Time spent inspecting the raw data allows a visual impression, which can indicate their nature.

Figure 1 shows two sets of data, each with 50 observations, randomly sampled, with very similar mean values, but drawn from two populations with differing distributions. The dot plots of the raw data clearly demonstrate that the distribution of the points is different between the two sets. The first set has a Gaussian (or normal) distribution, so the values are symmetrically distributed. The second set is right skewed (lognormal), with a limited number of smaller values and a few large values. This type of distribution of values is quite common in biology, for example plasma concentrations of immune or inflammatory mediators. Imagine presenting the plunger plots only: who would know that the values were skewed – and that the common statistical tests would be inappropriate?

image
Figure 1. Comparison of a dot plot with a plunger plot A, two datasets, with the same mean value, displayed as either dot plots or plunger plots. The bars are mean values: error bars indicate sem. B, subsamples of 6 data points from the above datasets. The line indicates the mean of these values.

The dot plot shows each observation we have sampled. On the other hand, the plunger plot obscures both the number of values and their distribution. The entire column of the plunger plot attracts attention. The width, colour, or shading of the column can distract the eye, whereas in fact the only feature that’s relevant is the height of the column itself. When a bar plot is used, any error bars that are shown are often not properly defined, and often only display the upper error, assuming, often incorrectly, the lower error to be symmetric. If measures are paired or repeated several times, then it’s preferable to be able to show these relationships. This is possible with a dot plot by joining up the dots with lines indicating relationship. This cannot be done with plunger plots.

Dynamite plunger plots are never an appropriate way to plot the data. If dot plots are inappropriate, because the sample size is too large and the plot becomes too cluttered, then a better way to plot the data is to have a point or line representing the mean, rather than the commonly used bar. Errors bars illustrating the 95% confidence interval (ci) should also be included. The figure should be appropriately annotated to indicate that the mean and 95%ci are being shown.

We also show a subsample of six observations. This is a more frequent size of sample in lab studies (Watters & Goodman, 1999). The precision with which we can estimate the exact features of the entire population is reduced. Notice first that the asymmetry of the skewed data results in a different mean value and that, once more, these variations are not evident with the plunger plots. Also notice that the skew of the values is less evident. However, if the mathematical basis of the data was known to give the data a propensity for this effect, then this could still be reasonably suspected.

Once we have had the chance to ‘see’ the data with the dot plot, we will appreciate more clearly how we may wish to demonstrate other features of the data. What do we wish to present from our sample, in addition to the actual values? If we want to summarize the entire population and in particular indicate the extent of variation of these values, then the appropriate values to calculate are the mean and the standard deviation (sd). When data are skewed, the mean is not always the best choice of summary. An alternative and perhaps preferable index of scatter would be the 95% confidence limits. However, 95% confidence limits should only be used when a substantial sample size is available.

The values we sampled are thus used to estimate the characteristics of the entire population. The larger the sample, the more likely it will be representative and the better our estimate of the entire population will be. Note that this is only true if the selection of samples has been random. If there has been bias in the selection process, then the data may not become more representative as more observations are added.

Using such estimates of the population, we could determine if another subsequent value that we obtained was abnormal (because it fell outside an expected range that we had defined). In some cases this may be why the original sampling of the population was done. To define reference ranges a very large sample of normal values is needed. Then the 95%ci is chosen as the reference range. This implies, by definition, that those 5% of ‘normal values’ that lie outside the range would be considered abnormal. We can then say that a new value drawn from this population would be likely, 95% of the time, to have a value within these confidence limits. These features of the entire population are shown on the left in Fig. 2.

image
Figure 2. Different types of error bar In each pair of examples, 50 and 6 samples have been taken. The central line represents the mean value, and the error bars show the values stated. Note how the precision of the mean value (i.e. the sem and the ci of the mean) is affected by the small sample, whereas the indices of dispersion (sd and ci of the population) are less affected.

However, in experimental biology data are usually obtained to compare one group with another. To summarize the characteristic feature of each group, the mean is calculated. To assess the precision with which we believe we know this value, we calculate the standard error of this mean. Again, a better index of this precision would be the 95% confidence values for the mean, which indicate that we’d be 95% likely to get another estimate of the mean within this range, using another set of data samples from the same population. Note how subsamples of the data give similar estimates of the entire population, but reduce the precision of the estimate of the mean (i.e. the sem is greater, because it is inversely proportional to the number of observations).

To summarize, although the dynamite plunger is a frequent plot in many subject fields, it has been progressively discarded in others, because it emphasizes the wrong features. Data can be better presented and compared using alternative methods. This is important where inferences have to be drawn about differences between samples, such as the effects of treatment (a topic we will address later). We argue, as many others have done before, that the simplest method may often be the best: just plot the actual values.

A big advantage of the plots we illustrate is that they allow easy application of an under-used, but familiar and comforting method of analysis: the ‘eyeball’ test. It may be crude, but it’s robust, and if used in obvious cases, can become the ‘barn door’ test: all that’s needed.

Later editorials will deal with using samples for statistical comparison, and other frequently used statistical tests.},

abstract = {The firing rates of neurons in the central visual pathway vary with stimulus strength, but not necessarily in a linear manner. In the contrast domain, the neural response function for cells in the primary visual cortex is characterized by expansive and compressive nonlinearities at low and high contrasts, respectively. A compressive nonlinearity at high contrast is also found for early visual pathway neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). This mechanism affects processing in the visual cortex. A fundamentally related issue is the possibility of an expansive nonlinearity at low contrast in LGN. To examine this possibility, we have obtained contrast‚Äìresponse data for a population of LGN neurons. We find for most cells that the best-fit function requires an expansive component. Additionally, we have measured the responses of LGN neurons to m-sequence white noise and examined the static relationship between a linear prediction and actual spike rate. We find that this static relationship is well fit by an expansive nonlinear power law with average exponent of 1.58. These results demonstrate that neurons in early visual pathways exhibit expansive nonlinear responses at low contrasts. Although this thalamic expansive nonlinearity has been largely ignored in models of early visual processing, it may have important consequences because it potentially affects the interpretation of a variety of visual functions.},

This behavioral finding has been attributed via neurophysiological investigations to processes within the visual cortex. However, some evidence indicates that contrast adaptation phenomena are also found in early visual pathways. Adaptation effects have been reported in retina and lateral geniculation nucleus (LGN). It is possible that these early pathways could be the physiological origin of the cortical adaptation effect. To investigate this, we have recorded from single neurons in the cat’s LGN. We find that contrast adaptation in the LGN, unlike that in the visual cortex, is not spatial frequency specific, i.e., adaptation effects apply to a broad range of spatial frequencies. In addition, aside from the amplitude attenuation, the shape of spatial frequency tuning curves of LGN cells is not affected by contrast adaptation. Again, these findings are unlike those found for cells in the visual cortex. Together, these results demonstrate that pattern specific contrast adaptation is a cortical process.},

The use of a 0.3 degree window proved effective in eliminating enough spatiotemporal interactions to abolish cortical direction selectivity. The same window improved the responsiveness at high velocities in only 26% of the cortical cells preferring low velocities and having a receptive field with nonoverlapping ON and OFF subregions. The remaining 74% showed various degrees of velocity-independent decrease in response amplitude. The only two geniculate cells that had a velocity upper cutoff lost this cutoff when tested with the mask. Cortical units preferring high velocities lost their responsiveness at high velocities in the mask condition, provided that their receptive fields contained nonoverlapping ON and OFF subregions. Cortical units, which responded best at intermediate velocities and which had receptive fields with nonoverlapping subregions, lost their sharp velocity tuning when tested with a mask. We conclude that inhibitory spatiotemporal interactions can account for the preference for low velocities in at most a quarter of the cells with nonoverlapping subregions. In contrast, facilitatory interactions seem to be important for cortical cells preferring high or intermediate velocities and having receptive fields with nonoverlapping subregions.},

The aim was to test the hypothesis that the range of effective velocities depends on the time needed for the bar to cross the receptive field. Forty-two percent of the area 17 cells and 8% of the area 18 cells responded poorly or not at all to briefly presented stationary stimulation. These cells were unable to respond at high velocities, and for these “duration-sensitive” cells the velocity characteristics are well predicted on the basis of responses to stationary stimulation of different durations. Cells that responded equally well to periods of stationary stimulation ranging from 12.5 to 3,200 ms (”duration-insensitive cells”) were found to be able to respond at all equivalent velocities, but their preference for either high, low, or intermediate velocities was not reflected in differences in responsiveness to the different durations tested. Duration-sensitive cells in area 17 tended to have a receptive field near the area centralis, and 73% of them were classified as S-family cells, one third being end-stopped S-cells. In contrast only 18% of the duration-insensitive cells were of the S family, and these S-family cells were rarely end-stopped (1/12) or rarely had receptive fields within 5 degrees of the fovea (3/12). Duration-sensitive cells had very long latencies (median 285 ms) in response to a stationary flashed light bar of 1 s duration but much shorter latencies (median 91 ms) when tested with a slowly moving light bar. This difference was not seen in duration-insensitive cells (median latencies = 61 and 59 ms). The ability to respond at high velocity was contrast dependent. At a low contrast level all cells failed to respond to brief stimulation, whether moving or stationary. At high contrast levels only the duration-insensitive cells showed an increased responsivity to brief stimuli. The absence of responses in duration-sensitive cells to brief stimuli of high contrast may depend upon suppressive influences reaching these cells before the excitatory influences. We conclude that the velocity upper cutoff of most S-family cells with a central receptive field can be predicted from a knowledge of the minimum duration of stationary presentation required for their activation (median ON duration threshold, 200 ms).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Many cortical areas are organized into functional columns, in which neurons are believed to be densely connected and to share common input. Numerous studies report a high degree of correlated variability between nearby cells. We developed chronically implanted multitetrode arrays offering unprecedented recording quality to reexamine this question in the primary visual cortex of awake macaques. We found that even nearby neurons with similar orientation tuning show virtually no correlated variability. Our findings suggest a refinement of current models of cortical microcircuit architecture and function: Either adjacent neurons share only a few percent of their inputs or, alternatively, their activity is actively decorrelated.},

For a Poisson process, the theoretical Fano factor is exactly one. For simulated or experimental neural data, the sample Fano factor is never exactly one, but often appears close to one. In this short communication, we characterize the distribution of the Fano factor for a Poisson process, allowing us to compute probability bounds and perform hypothesis tests on the distribution of recorded neural spike counts. We show that for a Poisson process the Fano factor asymptotically follows a gamma distribution with dependence on the number of observations of spike counts, and that convergence to this asymptotic distribution is fast. The analysis provides a simple method to determine how close to 1 the computed Fano factor should be and to formally test whether the observed variability in the spiking is likely to arise in data generated by a Poisson process.},

How the respective specific properties translate into mechanisms that regulate sensory-evoked responses of pyramidal neurons (PNs) remains unknown. Here, we investigated how INs located in cortical layer 1 (L1) of rat barrel cortex affect whisker-evoked responses of L2 PNs. To do so we combined in vivo electrophysiology and morphological reconstructions with computational modeling. We show that whisker-evoked membrane depolarization in L2 PNs arises from highly specialized spatiotemporal synaptic input patterns. Temporally L1 INs and L2-5 PNs provide near synchronous synaptic input. Spatially synaptic contacts from L1 INs target distal apical tuft dendrites, whereas PNs primarily innervate basal and proximal apical dendrites. Simulations of such constrained synaptic input patterns predicted that inactivation of L1 INs increases trial-to-trial variability of whisker-evoked responses in L2 PNs. The in silico predictions were confirmed in vivo by L1-specific pharmacological manipulations. We present a mechanism-consistent with the theory of distal dendritic shunting-that can regulate the robustness of sensory-evoked responses in PNs without affecting response amplitude or latency.},

year = {1996}, 
abstract = {In order to allow the relation of functional connectivity patterns (inferred from cross-correlograms) to structural connectivity (the anatomical substrate), we analyzed cross-correlogram peaks for spontaneous and stimulated activity in the auditory cortex. It was assumed that the broad correlograms, usually encountered, represent neural connectivity as well as secondary effects such as intrinsic firing patterns, global synchrony related to the ongoing electroencephalographic activity, and stimulus-related effects. Data were collected from 604 neuron pairs recorded under spontaneous conditions in primary auditory cortex of seven juvenile (30-70 days) and nine adult cats. Three hundred and six pairs (51%) had a peak cross-correlation coefficient significantly different from zero. For 113 neuron pairs out of this subgroup, correlations were calculated also for spike trains recorded during click stimulation. After a combined burst-correction and deconvolution procedure was carried out, the correlation peak strengths were not significantly changed for spontaneous activity, but peak width was narrower for single-electrode pairs than for dual-electrode pairs, suggesting a better synchronization for neighboring neurons. Under click stimulation conditions, overall peak synchronization strength was independent of interelectrode distance, whereas, after correction for secondary and stimulus effects, peak synchronization was significantly lower for dual-electrode pairs. However, the primary peak width for single-electrode pairs under stimulus conditions was no longer different from that of dual-electrode pairs. This implies that both under spontaneous and stimulus conditions secondary effects largely obscure any underlying correlation produced by anatomical connectivity. The secondary effects may be the result of intrinsic as well as network properties in auditory cortex and may functionally be more important than the weak primary effects resulting from anatomical connections. Cross-interval analysis suggests that the correlations in auditory cortex are dynamic and may show random switching between states of stronger and weaker synchronization.},

pages = {16601–16608}, 
year = {2010}, 
abstract = {Visual cortex is traditionally viewed as a hierarchy of neural feature detectors, with neural population responses being driven by bottom-up stimulus features. Conversely, “predictive coding” models propose that each stage of the visual hierarchy harbors two computationally distinct classes of processing unit: representational units that encode the conditional probability of a stimulus and provide predictions to the next lower level; and error units that encode the mismatch between predictions and bottom-up evidence, and forward prediction error to the next higher level. Predictive coding therefore suggests that neural population responses in category-selective visual regions, like the fusiform face area (FFA), reflect a summation of activity related to prediction (”face expectation”) and prediction error (”face surprise”), rather than a homogenous feature detection response. We tested the rival hypotheses of the feature detection and predictive coding models by collecting functional magnetic resonance imaging data from the FFA while independently varying both stimulus features (faces vs houses) and subjects’ perceptual expectations regarding those features (low vs medium vs high face expectation). The effects of stimulus and expectation factors interacted, whereby FFA activity elicited by face and house stimuli was indistinguishable under high face expectation and maximally differentiated under low face expectation. Using computational modeling, we show that these data can be explained by predictive coding but not by feature detection models, even when the latter are augmented with attentional mechanisms. Thus, population responses in the ventral visual stream appear to be determined by feature expectation and surprise rather than by stimulus features per se.},

We present an alternative mechanistic approach for interpretation of this type of data recorded from X cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of cat. A general, linear, rate-based mathematical expression for the geniculate transfer ratio, i.e. the ratio between the first-harmonic components of the output of a geniculate relay cell and its retinal input, is derived. In linear theory this ratio is independent of the signal processing occurring at the retinal level. Further, the ratio is straightforwardly accessible in experiments due to the presence of S-potentials, representing the retinal input, in extracellular recordings from dLGN. The expression accounts for feedforward inputs from retina and intrageniculate interneurons as well as feedback inputs from cortex and the thalamic reticular nucleus and can be used to experimentally test different mechanistic models for the geniculate circuitry. Two examples of this are considered: a purely feedforward model incorporating relay cell inputs from retinal ganglion cells and interneurons, and a model including cortical feedback inhibition of relay cells via intrageniculate interneurons.},

Rodieck introduced the Difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) model, and this model has been widely used by the visual neuroscience community to quantitatively account for spatial response properties of cells in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus following visual stimulation. Circular patches of drifting gratings are now regularly used as visual stimuli when probing the early visual system, but for this stimulus type the mathematical evaluation of the DOG-model response is significantly more complicated than for moving bars, full-field drifting gratings, or circular flashing spots. Here we derive mathematical formulas for the DOG-model response to centered circular patch gratings. The response is found to be given as the difference between two summed series, where each term in the series involves the confluent hypergeometric function. This function is available in commonly used mathematical software, and the results should thus be readily applicable. Example results illustrate how a strong surround suppression in area-summation curves for iso-luminant circular spots may be reversed into a surround enhancement for circular patch gratings. They also show that the spatial-frequency response changes from band-pass to low-pass when going from the full-field grating situation to the situation where the patch covers only the receptive-field center.},

Despite numerous experimental and modeling studies, the functional role for this feedback remains elusive. We present a new firing-rate-based model for LGN relay cells in cat, explicitly accounting for thalamocortical loop effects. The established DOG model, here assumed to account for the spatial aspects of the feedforward processing of visual stimuli, is extended to incorporate the influence of thalamocortical loops including a full set of orientation-selective cortical cell populations. Assuming a phase-reversed push-pull arrangement of ON and OFF cortical feedback as seen experimentally, this extended DOG (eDOG) model exhibits linear firing properties despite non-linear firing characteristics of the corticothalamic cells. The spatiotemporal receptive field of the eDOG model has a simple algebraic structure in Fourier space, while the real-space receptive field, as well as responses to visual stimuli, are found by evaluation of an integral. As an example application we use the eDOG model to study effects of cortical feedback on responses to flashing circular spots and patch-grating stimuli and find that the eDOG model can qualitatively account for experimental findings.},

abstract = {Visual processing in the brain seems to provide fast but coarse information before information about fine details. Such dynamics occur also in single neurons at several levels of the visual system. In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), neurons have a receptive field (RF) with antagonistic center-surround organization, and temporal changes in center-surround organization are generally assumed to be due to a time-lag of the surround activity relative to center activity. Spatial resolution may be measured as the inverse of center size, and in LGN neurons RF-center width changes during static stimulation with durations in the range of normal fixation periods (250‚Äì500 ms) between saccadic eye-movements. The RF-center is initially large, but rapidly shrinks during the first ~100 ms to a rather sustained size. We studied such dynamics in anesthetized cats during presentation (250 ms) of static spots centered on the RF with main focus on the transition from the first transient and highly dynamic component to the second more sustained component. The results suggest that the two components depend on different neuronal mechanisms that operate in parallel and with partial temporal overlap rather than on a continuously changing center-surround balance. Results from mathematical modeling further supported this conclusion. We found that existing models for the spatiotemporal RF of LGN neurons failed to account for our experimental results. The modeling demonstrated that a new model, in which the response is given by a sum of an early transient component and a partially overlapping sustained component, adequately accounts for our experimental data.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex are typically classified as either simple or complex. Whereas simple cells respond strongly to grating and bar stimuli displayed at a certain phase and visual field location, complex cell responses are insensitive to small translations of the stimulus within the receptive field [Hubel & Wiesel (1962) J. Physiol (Lond.), 160, 106-154; Kjaer et al. (1997) J. Neurophysiol, 78, 3187-3197]. This constancy in the response to variations of the stimuli is commonly called invariance. Hubel and Wiesel’s classical model of the primary visual cortex proposes a connectivity scheme which successfully describes simple and complex cell response properties. However, the question as to how this connectivity arises during normal development is left open. Based on their work and inspired by recent physiological findings we suggest a network model capable of learning from natural stimuli and developing receptive field properties which match those of cortical simple and complex cells. Stimuli are drawn from videos obtained by a camera mounted to a cat’s head, so they should approximate the natural input to the cat’s visual system. The network uses a competitive scheme to learn simple and complex cell response properties. Employing delayed signals to learn connections between simple and complex cells enables the model to utilize temporal properties of the input. We show that the temporal structure of the input gives rise to the emergence and refinement of complex cell receptive fields, whereas removing temporal continuity prevents this processes. This model lends a physiologically based explanation of the development of complex cell invariance response properties},

Electron microscope autoradiography was used to identify geniculate terminals that were labeled by anterograde transport of radioactivity injected into the A-laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Thirty-eight cell bodies (19 in layer IVab and 19 in layer IVc) were examined in a series of 138 consecutive sections. Two pyramidal somas were studied and had no geniculate contacts. All of the other somas studied were nonpyramidal, and of these, 85% received geniculate contacts. The proportion of somas receiving somatic geniculate input differed in layers IVab and IVc. In layer IVab, 70% of the nonpyramidal somas received geniculate contacts; in IVc, 100%. Such high percentages indicate that geniculate afferents synapse with more types of layer IV neuron than the aspinous neurons that synthesize gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) (Freund et al., ‘85b). The pattern of input to somas was so diverse that it was impossible to form groups of neurons based on only this criterion. We wondered if it would be possible to form groups of neurons based on a range of characteristics among which would be pattern of synaptic input. To this end, pyramidal neurons and neurons that contained a cytoplasmic laminated body (CLB) (Winfield, ‘79; Einstein et al., ‘84) were treated as two separate classes. We found fair agreement among the features of these neurons within their own classes, with the CLB-cells in layer IVab and IVc forming separate groups. Among the remaining neurons there was too little agreement within the range of features to enable us to treat them in this manner. Geniculate somatic contacts in both sublayers were of 2 forms, those with round vesicles and asymmetric thickenings (RA) and those with pleomorphic vesicles and symmetric thickenings (PS) (Einstein et al., ‘87). The distribution of these forms varied: some cells received contacts exclusively from one form or the other; other cells received contacts from both. On one cell that bore 33 somatic geniculate terminals, 61% were RA and 39% were PS. Such substantial numbers of geniculate contacts located near the site of impulse initiation are likely to contribute significantly to the receptive field properties of this neuron, and the possible effects are discussed.},

The geniculate RA terminals were presynaptic to dendritic spines, fine processes, and cell bodies; the geniculate PS terminals were presynaptic to dendrites and cell bodies but not to spines. The possible sources of geniculate PS terminals are discussed.},

abstract = {Coordination among cortical neurons is believed to be a key element in mediating many high-level cortical processes such as perception, attention, learning, and memory formation. Inferring the structure of the neural circuitry underlying this coordination is important to characterize the highly nonlinear, time-varying interactions between cortical neurons in the presence of complex stimuli. In this work, we investigate the applicability of dynamic Bayesian networks (DBNs) in inferring the effective connectivity between spiking cortical neurons from their observed spike trains. We demonstrate that DBNs can infer the underlying nonlinear and time-varying causal interactions between these neurons and can discriminate between mono- and polysynaptic links between them under certain constraints governing their putative connectivity. We analyzed conditionally Poisson spike train data mimicking spiking activity of cortical networks of small and moderately large size. The performance was assessed and compared to other methods under systematic variations of the network structure to mimic a wide range of responses typically observed in the cortex. Results demonstrate the utility of DBN in inferring the effective connectivity in cortical networks.},

These areas correspond to different levels of the occipitoparietal cortical ‘stream’, which processes information related to motion and spatial relationships in the visual field. The tissue was immunocytochemically processed to obtain a light-stable diaminobenzidine reaction product, revealing the dendritic morphology in fine detail. Retrogradely labelled MT-projecting neurons in supragranular V1 (layer IIIc of Hassler’s nomenclature, corresponding to Brodmann’s layer IVb) were predominantly pyramidal, although many spiny multipolar (stellate) cells were also found. The average basal dendritic field area of pyramidal neurons in sublamina IIIc of V1 was significantly smaller than that in the homologous layer of V2, within the cytochrome oxidase-rich thick stripes. Furthermore, the average basal dendritic field areas of V1 and V2 pyramidal neurons were significantly smaller than those of neurons in MT, LIPv and area 7a. There was no difference in basal dendritic field area between layer III pyramidal neurons in areas MT, LIPv and 7a. While the shape of most basal dendritic fields was circularly symmetrical in the dimension tangential to the cortical layers, there were significant biases in complexity, with dendritic branches tending to cluster along particular axes. Sholl analysis revealed that the dendritic fields of neurons in areas MT, LIPv and 7a were significantly more complex (i.e. had a larger number of branches) than those of V1 or V2 neurons. Analysis of basal dendritic spine densities revealed regional variations along the dendrites, with peak densities being observed 40-130 microns from the cell body, depending on the visual area. The peak spine density of layer III pyramidal neurons in V1 was lower than that observed in V2, MT or LIPv, which were all similar. Pyramidal neurons in area 7a had the greatest peak spine density, which was on average 1.7 times that found in V1. Calculations based on the average spine density and number of dendritic branches at different distances from the cell body demonstrated a serial increase in the total number of basal dendritic spines per neuron at successive stations of the occipitoparietal pathway. Our observations, comparing dendritic fields of neurons in the homologous cortical layer at different levels of a physiologically defined ‘stream’, indicate changes in pyramidal cell morphology between functionally related areas. The relatively large, complex, spine-dense dendritic fields of layer III pyramidal cells in rostral areas of the occipitoparietal pathway allow these cells to sample a greater number of more diverse inputs in comparison with cells in ‘lower’ areas of the proposed hierarchy.},

Empirical support for expectation-related feedback is compelling but restricted to adult humans and nonhuman animals. Given the considerable differences in neural organization, connectivity, and efficiency between infant and adult brains, it is a crucial yet open question whether expectation-related feedback is an inherent property of the cortex (i.e., operational early in development) or whether expectation-related feedback develops with extensive experience and neural maturation. To determine whether infants’ expectations about future sensory input modulate their sensory cortices without the confounds of stimulus novelty or repetition suppression, we used a cross-modal (audiovisual) omission paradigm and used functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) to record hemodynamic responses in the infant cortex. We show that the occipital cortex of 6-month-old infants exhibits the signature of expectation-based feedback. Crucially, we found that this region does not respond to auditory stimuli if they are not predictive of a visual event. Overall, these findings suggest that the young infant’s brain is already capable of some rudimentary form of expectation-based feedback.},

To investigate the influences of bottom-up (saliency) and top-down (task) factors on different stages of visual processing, we used transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) of areas V1/V2 to induce visual suppression at varying temporal intervals. Subjects were asked to detect and discriminate the color or the orientation of briefly-presented small lines that varied on color saliency based on color contrast with the surround. Regardless of task, color saliency modulated the magnitude of TMS-induced visual suppression, especially at earlier temporal processing intervals that reflect the feedforward stage of visual processing in V1/V2. In a second experiment we found that our color saliency effects were also influenced by an inherent advantage of the color red relative to other hues and that color discrimination difficulty did not affect visual suppression. These results support the notion that early visual processing is stimulus driven and that feedforward and feedback processing encode different types of information about visual scenes. They further suggest that certain hues can be prioritized over others within our visual systems by being more robustly represented during early temporal processing intervals.},

These “fixational” eye movements counteract perceptual fading, a consequence of fast adaptation of the retinal receptor systems to constant input. The most important contribution to fixational eye movements is produced by microsaccades; however, a specific function of microsaccades only recently has been found. Here we show that the occurrence of microsaccades is correlated with low retinal image slip approximately 200 ms before microsaccade onset. This result suggests that microsaccades are triggered dynamically, in contrast to the current view that microsaccades are randomly distributed in time characterized by their rate-of-occurrence of 1 to 2 per second. As a result of the dynamic triggering mechanism, individual microsaccade rate can be predicted by the fractal dimension of trajectories. Finally, we propose a minimal computational model for the dynamic triggering of microsaccades.},

By contrast, more recent approaches emphasize the constructive nature of perception, viewing it as an active and highly selective process. Indeed, there is ample evidence that the processing of stimuli is controlled by top-down influences that strongly shape the intrinsic dynamics of thalamocortical networks and constantly create predictions about forthcoming sensory events. We discuss recent experiments indicating that such predictions might be embodied in the temporal structure of both stimulus-evoked and ongoing activity, and that synchronous oscillations are particularly important in this process. Coherence among subthreshold membrane potential fluctuations could be exploited to express selective functional relationships during states of expectancy or attention, and these dynamic patterns could allow the grouping and selection of distributed neuronal responses for further processing Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

abstract = {1. Y-type ganglion cells in the cat’s retina were stimulated with bars of light and grating patterns at photopic luminances. Stimuli were stationary, and luminance at each point was varied sinusoidally in time at 2 Hz. Impulse rates were recorded from single cells. 2. When the stimulus was a narrow bar of light, the impulse rate approached a sinusoidal function of time as contrast was reduced. The linear behaviour of each cell was therefore characterized by taking the limit of response parameters as contrast approached zero. 3. The ratio of surround strength to centre strength varied widely between cells but the two strengths were approximately equal on average. The difference between surround phase and centre phase averaged 168 deg. 4. As contrast increased, responses became rectified. Rectifier output was well described by a power law of stimulus amplitude, where the power was usually 1.4 or 1.5. 5. Response phase advanced with increasing contrast, and at high response amplitudes grew less than proportionally with contrast. These effects were assumed due to the contrast gain control described by Shapley & Victor (1978). 6. Gratings in which luminance varied sinusoidally with distance were used to determine Y cell spatial resolution. The second-harmonic amplitude of the response diminished rapidly with increasing spatial frequency: the radius of the best-fitting Gaussian mechanism was about 0.25 deg for a cell at 10 deg eccentricity. 7. This spatial resolution is close to the linear resolution of X cells as determined by Linsenmeier, Frishman, Jakiela & Enroth-Cugell (1982). 8. A receptive field model incorporating both linear and non-linear elements is described. The model consists of an array of subunit pathways, each of which has a centre-surround organization followed by a rectifier; a pool weights and sums subunit outputs, and signals are then passed through a contrast gain control. 9. The model accounts qualitatively for the over-all centre-surround organization of Y cell linear responses, the dependence of frequency-doubled responses on spatial frequency, and impulse rate as a function of time for a variety of bar and grating stimuli.},

abstract = {1. The properties of the surround response mechanism of on-centre cells and its interaction with the centre mechanism were studied by recording from single optic tract fibres. In many of the experiments the spatial distribution of the light within the retinal image of the stimuli was measured.2. Pure surround responses of on-centre cells were isolated using a centrally located steady light which selectively desensitized (adapted) the centre mechanism. This permitted a peripheral flashing stimulus whose luminance varied over a range as great as 1.38 log units to elicit surround responses which, for any given cell, were of invariant shape. The rate of decay of the firing frequency of the spike burst at ;off’ varied from cell to cell. The general characteristics of such pure surround responses to squarewave stimuli were described. The plot of the magnitude of pure responses against stimulus luminance, at constant background conditions, was curvilinear.3. The pure surround response of two off-centre cells was isolated; it was similar in shape to the pure centre response of on-centre cells.4. Interaction of centre and surround mechanisms of on-centre cells was studied by eliciting a pure central and a pure surround response from the same cell. The electronically obtained algebraic sum of these two pure responses equalled the mixed response of the ganglion cell to simultaneous presentation of the stimuli which evoked the pure responses when presented singly. This is probably best explained by algebraic summation of centre and surround inputs.5. The pure surround response from two cells to a fixed flashing stimulus was attenuated by a steady field adapting light, both when this was superimposed upon the stimulus and when not superimposed. In the latter case, (i) when the spatial separation between the flashing stimulus and the adapting light was at a minimum, less than 10% of the adapting flux fell inside the boundaries of the stimulating flux, and (ii) the response was attenuated also if the adapting light was in the geometric centre of the receptive field. These results indicate that the adaptation pool of the surround mechanism extends to the central portions of the receptive field.6. Nearly half the cells tested did not yield pure surround responses. This was probably due to differences, within the ganglion cell population, (i) of the spatial distribution of the ratio of centre to surround signal sensitivity and (ii) of differences in the ratio of centre to surround adaptivity in the receptive field middle. It was not due to excess adaptive flux falling outside the region of maximal centre mechanism adaptivity, nor due to excess stimulus flux falling inside the region of maximal signal sensitivity.},

abstract = {1. Pure responses generated by the centre response mechanism of off-centre cells or the surround response mechanism of on-centre cells were studied in the cat by recording from single optic tract fibres while applying slow square-waves of light of varying duration but constant luminance.2. The response, whether due to a centre or a surround mechanism, consisted of a rapid decrease in firing frequency at onset of light, followed by a gradual recovery of firing rate while the light was on. The time course of the recovery was exponential. At ;off’ there was a sudden increase in firing rate (off-discharge) followed by an exponential, more gradual, decay of impulse frequency. Both the gradual recovery during illumination and the off-discharge were absent for the shortest flashes.3. Perhaps the most significant result was that the behaviour exhibited by responses generated by one only of the response mechanisms, centre or surround, is predictable and much simpler than that exhibited by mixed responses; the magnitude of the off-discharge increased, the latency decreased monotonically with increased flash duration and the magnitude of the off-discharge was linearly related to the level of firing at the moment when the light went off.4. For two off-centre cells gain was studied by recording the response to a brief test flash superimposed upon a slow gain changing square-wave stimulus. Centre mechanism gain decreased promptly upon application of the gain changing light, stayed low while it was on, only to return promptly to its former value when the gain changing light went off.5. A simple model which qualitatively accounts for the results (excluding latency) was suggested. The onset of light initiates both an inhibitory and excitatory process whose sum constitutes the transient input to the cell. The excitatory process grows at a slower rate so that ;excitation wins more and more as the light remains on’. Similarly after ;off’ the excitatory process decays slower than the inhibitory one, thus leaving the cell with a transient excess of net-excitation.},

Spatial summation within cat retinal receptive fields was studied by recording from optic-tract fibres the responses of ganglion cells to grating patterns whose luminance perpendicular to the bars varied sinusoidally about the mean level. 2. Summation over the receptive fields of some cells (X-cells) was found to be approximately linear, while for other cells (Y-cells) summation was very non-linear. 3. The mean discharge frequency of Y-cells (unlike that of X-cells) was greatly increased when grating patterns drifted across their receptive fields. 4. In twenty-one X-cells the relation between the contrast and spatial frequency of drifting sinusoidal gratings which evoked the same small response was measured. In every case it was found that the reciprocal of this relation, the contrast sensitivity function, could be satisfactorily described by the difference of two Gaussian functions. 5. This finding supports the hypothesis that the sensitivities of the antagonistic centre and surround summating regions of ganglion cell receptive fields fall off as Gaussian functions of the distance from the field centre. 6. The way in which the sensitivity of an X-cell for a contrast-edge pattern varied with the distance of the edge from the receptive field centre was determined and found to be consistent with the cell’s measured contrast sensitivity function. 7. Reducing the retinal illumination produced changes in the contrast sensitivity function of an X-cell which suggested that the diameters of the summating regions of the receptive field increased while the surround region became relatively ineffective.},

We stimulated the visual cortex of the ferret with a small transient contrast square stimulus and recorded the multiunit activity in areas 17, 18 and 19 with single or multiple electrodes. The spike trains had three reproducible components having their maxima at 40, 55 and 105ms after the start of the presentation of the stimulus.

abstract = {Even though the visual cortex is one of the most studied brain areas, the neuronal code in this area is still not fully understood. In the literature, two codes are commonly hypothesized, namely stimulus and predictive (error) codes. Here, we examined whether and how these two codes can coexist in a neuron. To this end, we assumed that neurons could predict a constant stimulus across time or space, since this is the most fundamental type of prediction. Prediction was examined in time using electrophysiology and voltage-sensitive dye imaging in the supragranular layers in area 18 of the anesthetized cat, and in space using a computer model. The distinction into stimulus and error code was made by means of the orientation tuning of the recorded unit. The stimulus was constructed as such that a maximum response to the non-preferred orientation indicated an error signal, and the maximum response to the preferred orientation indicated a stimulus signal. We demonstrate that a single neuron combines stimulus and error-like coding. In addition, we observed that the duration of the error coding varies as a function of stimulus contrast. For low contrast the error-like coding was prolonged by around 60-100%. Finally, the combination of stimulus and error leads to a suboptimal free energy in a recent predictive coding model. We therefore suggest a straightforward modification that can be applied to the free energy model and other predictive coding models. Combining stimulus and error might be advantageous because the stimulus code enables a direct stimulus recognition that is free of assumptions whereas the error code enables an experience dependent inference of ambiguous and non-salient stimuli.},

abstract = {Laminae A and A1 of the lateral geniculate nucleus in the cat are generally considered to be a structurally and functionally matched pair of inputs from two eyes, although there are subtle light microscopic and physiological differences. The present study aims to display ultrastructural differences between these two laminae based on electron microscopic observances on the connectivity patterns of their afferents onto two main cell types: relay cells, and interneurons present in this nucleus. In a design of population measurement from randomized sample areas in laminae A and A1 from six brains, all synaptic contacts made by three terminal types of the geniculate nucleus were identified, and a number of relative distribution properties were analyzed. When the A-laminae were considered as a homogeneous structure, the distribution of the three terminal types on geniculate cells was similar to previously reported results, confirming the validity of the sampling strategies used; RLP (retinal) terminals provided one-fifth of all synapses, whereas RD (from cortex and brainstem) and F (inhibitory) types constituted one-half and one-third, respectively. The relay cells alone received a similar composition of afferents. However, interneurons alone received approximately equal amounts of synapses from the three sources. Similar analyses comparing the distributions in lamina A and A1 revealed that RD and F terminals, but not RLP terminals, innervate these two laminae differently; more RD and fewer F terminals were found in lamina A1. This difference was also present in the distribution of terminals on relay cells alone, but not on interneurons. These results suggest that (1) retinal terminals form a significantly larger fraction of the input to interneurons than to relay cells; correspondingly, cortex and brainstem provide a smaller fraction of all inputs to interneurons than to relay cells; and (2) laminae A and A1 are not strictly equivalent projection sites of the two retinae. The results are discussed in relation to the Y-cell subpopulation in lamina A1 that is involved in corticotectal, as well as corticogeniculate circuits, as opposed to Y-cells of lamina A that are involved in only the latter.

abstract = {Metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) play a crucial role in regulation of phasic inhibition within the visual thalamus. Here we demonstrate that mGluR-dependent modulation of interneuron GABA release results in dynamic changes in extrasynaptic GABA(A) receptor (eGABA(A)R)-dependent tonic inhibition in thalamocortical (TC) neurons of the rat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Application of the group I selective mGluR agonist dihydroxyphenylglycine produces a concentration-dependent enhancement of both IPSC frequency and tonic GABA(A) current (I(GABA)tonic) that is due to activation of both mGluR1a and mGluR5 subtypes. In contrast, group II/III mGluR activation decreases both IPSC frequency and I(GABA)tonic amplitude. Using knock-out mice, we show that the mGluR-dependent modulation of I(GABA)tonic is dependent upon expression of delta-subunit containing eGABA(A)Rs. Furthermore, unlike the dLGN, no mGluR-dependent modulation of I(GABA)tonic is present in TC neurons of the somatosensory ventrobasal thalamus, which lacks GABAergic interneurons. In the dLGN, enhancement of IPSC frequency and I(GABA)tonic by group I mGluRs is not action potential dependent, being insensitive to TTX, but is abolished by the L-type Ca(2+) channel blocker nimodipine. These results indicate selective mGluR-dependent modulation of dendrodendritic GABA release from F2-type terminals on interneuron dendrites and demonstrate for the first time the presence of eGABA(A)Rs on TC neuron dendritic elements that participate in “triadic” circuitry within the dLGN. These findings present a plausible novel mechanism for visual contrast gain at the thalamic level and shed new light upon the potential role of glial ensheathment of synaptic triads within the dLGN.},

abstract = {Hypotheses of sensory coding range from the notion of nonlinear “feature detectors” to linear rate coding strategies. Here, we report that auditory neurons exhibit a novel trade-off in the relationship between sound selectivity and the information that can be communicated to a postsynaptic cell. Recordings from the cat inferior colliculus show that neurons with the lowest spike rates reliably signal the occurrence of stereotyped stimulus features, whereas those with high response rates exhibit lower selectivity. The highest information conveyed by individual action potentials comes from neuons with low spike rate and high selectivity. Surprisingly, spike information is inversely related to spike rates, following a trend similar to that of feature selectivity. Information per time interval, however, was proportional to measured spike rates. A neuronal model based on the spike threshold of the synaptic drive accurately accounts for this trade-off: higher thresholds enhance the spiking fidelity at the expense of limiting the total communicated information. Such a constraint on the specificity and throughput creates a continuum in the neural code with two extreme forms of information transfer that likely serve complementary roles in the representation of the auditory environment.},

The bulk of the evidence has been taken to support the existence of multiple, linear color mechanisms in addition to (or after) the three putative low-level cardinal mechanisms. But there remain disconcerting inconsistencies in the results of noise masking experiments, and the results of chromatic discrimination experiments clearly show that there are a very limited number of labeled-line mechanisms near threshold. No consensus on higher order mechanisms has been reached even after more than 20 years of study.},

abstract = {The role of corticogeniculate feedback in the organization, function, and state dependence of visual responses and receptive fields (RFs) is not well understood. We investigated the contribution of the corticogeniculate loop to state-dependent changes of characteristics of the primary visual cortex response by using a novel approach of eliminating corticogeniculate projection neurons with targeted neuronal apoptosis. Experiments were performed in anesthetized cats (N2O plus halothane) with parallel recordings of single units from experimental (right) and control (left) hemispheres ∼2 weeks after induction of apoptosis. Within the experimental hemispheres, neurons of area 17 and of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) showed an unusually enhanced and prolonged tonic visual response during episodes of synchronized (syn) EEG activity, whereas response levels during less synchronized states were almost normal. In addition, dLGN cells showed a reduced tendency for burst firing and a less regular spike interval distribution compared with those of controls. These changes are likely attributable to a tonic depolarization of dLGN relay neurons or, more likely, to a decreased responsiveness of thalamic inhibitory processes to cortical feedback. Cortical neurons also displayed an activity-dependent increase in RF size, in contrast to an almost activity-invariant RF size of controls, a phenomenon likely related to the elimination of collateral, intracortical projections of layer 6 neurons. Together, these results demonstrate that selective chronic elimination of corticogeniculate feedback results in the loss of EEG-correlated differences of visual processing in the remaining thalamocortical network, accompanied by a significant increase in excitability during syn EEG, at the expense of noticeably reduced spatial receptive-field specificity in the remaining cortical neurons.},

abstract = {Single neurones were recorded in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (d.l.g.n.) of adult cats anaesthetized with a mixture of halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen. The multibarrel-glass micro-electrodes were filled with sodium acetate, L-glutamate, acetylcholine (ACh), gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and bicuculline. In normally innervated, spontaneously active d.l.g.n. cells, ACh and L-glutamate elicited increased firing rates. After elimination of the excitatory input from the retina by retinal photocoagulation, the effects of ACh and L-glutamate were similar. This proves that both drugs have direct excitatory effects on d.l.g.n. cells and that disinhibition is not the most prominent influence of ACh in the d.l.g.n. The excitatory action of ACh on relay cells in the d.l.g.n. was strongly influenced by barbiturates. Sub-narcotic levels of sodium pentobarbitone completely abolished the excitation by ACh while the response to L-glutamate remained unchanged. Excitation, centre-surround antagonism and periphery effects were elicited by spots of light and by large field phase-reversing gratings with and without central sparing of the receptive field area. Binocular inhibition was elicited with the phase-reversing grating presented to the non-dominant eye. After localized destruction of the retinal receptive field area, retinogeniculate excitation ceased and an isolated lateral inhibition was observed in the acutely deafferented d.l.g.n. cells. The time course and strength of this inhibition was disclosed by raising the background discharge with microiontophoretically applied L-glutamate. With increasing size of retinal lesions the strength of isolated lateral inhibition decreased exponentially. A maximal intrageniculate range of more than 1000 microns was derived from computations of the lateral extent of deafferentation in the d.l.g.n. The inhibition acted beyond the classic surround inhibition of d.l.g.n. cells and thus was named long-range lateral inhibition. Microiontophoretically applied GABA elicits a strong inhibitory effect at the d.l.g.n. cells which is antagonized by bicuculline. Centre-surround antagonism, binocular inhibition and long-range inhibition were blocked by bicuculline and thus proven to be GABAergic. Each class of inhibition was differentially influenced by microiontophoretically applied ACh. Long-range inhibition was disinhibited, centre-surround antagonism was enhanced, and binocular inhibition was not significantly changed. In contrast to ACh excitation, the disinhibitory action of ACh was not suppressed by pentobarbitone.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {1. Adult cats were anaesthetized with a mixture of halothane, nitrous oxide and oxygen to record from single neurones of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (d.l.g.n.) with five-barrel glass micro-electrodes. Periphery effects (shift effects) were elicited by large-field phase-reversing gratings presented in the visual field outside the conventional receptive field area. 2. A range of transient excitatory responses was found in X and Y cells. Y cells had phasic shift effects with significantly higher amplitudes and shorter durations (mean 52 impulses/s, 135 ms) than those observed in the tonic shift effects of X cells (mean 24 impulses/s, 169 ms). All Y cells and most X cells responded to stimulation of remote retinal regions. About 7% of the X cells displayed no shift effect. 3. Micro-ionophoresis of the gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antagonist bicuculline, acetylcholine (ACh) and L-glutamate specifically influenced the shift effects of X and Y cells. 4. During continuous application of the GABA antagonist bicuculline the differences in maximal response rates and amplitudes of X and Y cells were eliminated. The maintained activity raised predominantly in X cells and the early peak rates increased more in X- than in Y-cell shift effects, leading to equal average peak rates of 100 and response amplitudes of about 85 impulses/s in both cell classes. The characteristic time courses of X- and Y-cell responses were not affected. 5. Micro-ionophoretic application of ACh caused a combination of excitatory and disinhibitory effects. Maintained activity as well as early parts of stimulus-evoked responses were similarly raised in X and Y cells. In addition, the Y-cell shift effects became less phasic by elevation of the late response part. Sodium pentobarbitone, used to block ACh excitation, suppressed the ACh-induced effects in the early phase of the X- and Y-cell shift effects and the increase of maintained activity in Y-cells, while the effect on the late part of Y-cell responses persisted. Elevation of background activity partially remained in X cells, and the X-cell responses became tonically prolonged at the same time. 6. L-Glutamate increased the activity of X and Y cells without changing the characteristic shift-effect properties of both cell classes. 7. It is concluded that different short- and long-lasting inhibitory mechanisms shape the responses of d.l.g.n. neurones to stimulation outside the conventional receptive field.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {In masking, a stimulus is rendered invisible through the presentation of a second stimulus shortly after the first. Over the years, authors have typically explained masking by postulating some early disruption process. In these feedforward-type explanations, the mask somehow “catches up” with the target stimulus, disrupting its processing either through lateral or interchannel inhibition. However, studies from recent years indicate that visual perception--and most notably visual awareness itself--may depend strongly on cortico-cortical feedback connections from higher to lower visual areas. This has led some researchers to propose that masking derives its effectiveness from selectively interrupting these reentrant processes. In this experiment, we used electroencephalogram measurements to determine what happens in the human visual cortex during detection of a texture-defined square under nonmasked (seen) and masked (unseen) conditions. Electro-encephalogram derivatives that are typically associated with reentrant processing turn out to be absent in the masked condition. Moreover, extrastriate visual areas are still activated early on by both seen and unseen stimuli, as shown by scalp surface Laplacian current source-density maps. This conclusively shows that feedforward processing is preserved, even when subject performance is at chance as determined by objective measures. From these results, we conclude that masking derives its effectiveness, at least partly, from disrupting reentrant processing, thereby interfering with the neural mechanisms of figure-ground segmentation and visual awareness itself.},

Some authors have proposed that its neural correlates correspond with recurrent processing within visual cortex, whereas others have argued they are located in a frontoparietal network. The present experiment aims to bring together these competing viewpoints. We recorded EEG from human subjects that were engaged in detecting masked visual targets. From this, we obtained a spatiotemporal profile of neural activity selectively related to the processing of the targets, which we correlated with the subjects’ ability to detect those targets. This made it possible to distinguish between those stages of visual processing that correlate with human perception and those that do not. The results show that target induced extra-striate feedforward activity peaking at 121 ms does not correlate with perception, whereas more posterior recurrent activity peaking at 160 ms does. Several subsequent stages show an alternating pattern of frontoparietal and occipital activity, all of which correlate highly with perception. This shows that perception emerges early on, but only after an initial feedforward volley, and suggests that multiple reentrant loops are involved in propagating this signal to frontoparietal areas.},

abstract = {Previous studies have suggested the relation of particular frequency bands such as theta (4‚Äì8 Hz), alpha (8‚Äì14 Hz), beta (14‚Äì30 Hz), or gamma (>30 Hz) to cognitive functions. However, there has been controversy over which bands are specifically related to attention. We used the attention network test to separate three anatomically defined brain networks that carry out the functions of alerting, orienting, and executive control of attention. High-density scalp electrical recording was performed to record synchronous oscillatory activity and power spectrum analyses based on functional magnetic resonance imaging constrained dipole modeling were conducted for each attentional network. We found that each attentional network has a distinct set of oscillations related to its activity. The alerting network showed a specific decrease in theta-, alpha-, and beta-band activity 200‚Äì450 ms after a warning signal. The orienting network showed an increase in gamma-band activity at 200 ms after a spatial cue, indicating the location of a target. The executive control network revealed a complex pattern when a target was surrounded with incongruent flankers compared with congruent flankers. There was an early (<400 ms) increase in gamma-band activity, a later (>400 ms) decrease in beta- and low gamma-band activity after the target onset, and a decrease of all frequency bands before response followed by an increase after the response. These data demonstrate that attention is not related to any single frequency band but that each network has a distinct oscillatory activity and time course.},

Evidence for this theory has come primarily from studies of neurological patients and animals. Using fMRI, we show here that even though observers are completely unaware of test object images owing to interocular suppression, their dorsal cortical areas demonstrate substantial activity for different types of visual objects, with stronger responses to images of tools than of human faces. This result also suggests that in binocular rivalry, substantial information in the suppressed eye can escape the interocular suppression and reach dorsal cortex.},

abstract = {Adaptation is a general property of almost all neural systems and has been a longstanding tool of psychophysics because of its power to isolate and temporarily reduce the contribution of specific neural populations. Recently, adaptation designs have been extensively applied in functional MRI (fMRI) studies to infer neural selectivity in specific cortical areas. However, there has been considerable variability in the duration of adaptation used in these experiments. In particular, although long-term adaptation has been solidly established in psychophysical and neurophysiological studies, it has been incorporated into few fMRI studies. Furthermore, there has been little validation of fMRI adaptation using stimulus dimensions with well-known adaptive properties (e.g., orientation) and in better understood regions of cortex (e.g., primary visual cortex, V1). We used an event-related fMRI experiment to study long-term orientation adaptation in the human visual cortex. After long-term adaptation to an oriented pattern, the fMRI response in V1, V2, V3/VP, V3A, and V4 to a test stimulus was proportional to the angular difference between the adapting and test stimuli. However, only V3A and V4 showed this response pattern with short-term adaptation. In a separate experiment, we measured behavioral contrast detection thresholds after adaptation and found that the fMRI signal in V1 closely matched the psychophysically derived contrast detection thresholds. Similar to the fMRI results, adaptation induced threshold changes strongly depended on the duration of adaptation. In addition to supporting the existence of adaptable orientation-tuned neurons in human visual cortex, our results show the importance of considering timing parameters in fMRI adaptation experiments.},

abstract = {The lateral intraparietal area (LIP) of the macaque is believed to play a role in the allocation of attention and the plan to make saccadic eye movements. Many studies have shown that LIP neurons generally encode the static spatial location demarked by the receptive field (RF). LIP neurons might also provide information about the features of visual stimuli within the RF. For example, LIP receives input from cortical areas in the dorsal visual pathway that contain many direction-selective neurons. Here we examine direction selectivity of LIP neurons. Animals were only required to fixate while motion stimuli appeared in the RF. To avoid spatial confounds, the motion stimuli were patches of randomly arrayed dots that moved with 100% coherence in eight different directions. We found that the majority (61%) of LIP neurons were direction selective. The direction tuning was fairly broad, with a median direction-tuning bandwidth of 136 degrees. The average strength of direction selectivity was weaker in LIP than that of other areas of the dorsal visual stream but that difference may be because of the fact that LIP neurons showed a tonic offset in firing whenever a visual stimulus was in the RF, independent of direction. Direction-selective neurons do not seem to constitute a functionally distinct subdivision within LIP, because those neurons had robust, sustained delay-period activity during a memory delayed saccade task. The direction selectivity could also not be explained by asymmetries in the spatial RF, in the hypothetical case that the animals attended to slightly different locations depending on the direction of motion in the RF. Our results show that direction selectivity is a distinct attribute of LIP neurons in addition to spatial encoding.},

abstract = {Thalamic neurons have two firing modes: tonic and bursting. It was originally suggested that bursting occurs only during states such as slow-wave sleep, when little or no information is relayed by the thalamus. However, bursting occurs during wakefulness in the visual and somatosensory thalamus, and could theoretically influence sensory processing. Here we used chronically implanted electrodes to record from the ventroposterior medial thalamic nucleus (VPM) and primary somatosensory cortex (SI) of awake, freely moving rats during different behaviors. These behaviors included quiet immobility, exploratory whisking (large-amplitude whisker movements), and whisker twitching (small-amplitude, 7- to 12-Hz whisker movements). We demonstrated that thalamic bursting appeared during the oscillatory activity occurring before whisker twitching movements, and continued throughout the whisker twitching. Further, thalamic bursting occurred during whisker twitching substantially more often than during the other behaviors, and a neuron was most likely to respond to a stimulus if a burst occurred approximately 120 ms before the stimulation. In addition, the amount of cortical area activated was similar to that during whisking. However, when SI was inactivated by muscimol infusion, whisker twitching was never observed. Finally, we used a statistical technique called partial directed coherence to identify the direction of influence of neural activity between VPM and SI, and observed that there was more directional coherence from SI to VPM during whisker twitching than during the other behaviors. Based on these findings, we propose that during whisker twitching, a descending signal from SI triggers thalamic bursting that primes the thalamocortical loop for enhanced signal detection during the whisker twitching behavior.},

year = {2006}, 
abstract = {The left and right eyes receive subtly different images from a visual scene. Binocular disparities of retinal image locations are correlated with variation in the depth of objects in the scene and make stereoscopic depth perception possible. Disparity stereoscopically specifies a stimulus; changing the stimulus in a way that conserves its disparity leaves the stimulus stereoscopically unchanged. Therefore, a person’s ability to use stereo to see the depth separating any two objects should depend only on the disparities of the objects, which in turn depend on where the objects are, not what they are. However, I find that the disparity difference between two stimuli by itself predicts neither stereoacuity nor perceived depth. Human stereo vision is shown here to be most sensitive at detecting the relative depth of two gratings when they are parallel. Rotating one grating by as little as 10 degrees lowers sensitivity. The rotation can make a perceptible depth separation invisible, although it changes neither the relative nor absolute disparities of the gratings, only their relative orientations. The effect of relative orientation is not confined to stimuli that, like gratings, vary along one dimension or to stimuli perceived to have a dominant orientation. Rather, it is the relative orientation of the one-dimensional components of stimuli, even broadband stimuli, that matters. This limit on stereoscopic depth perception appears to be intrinsic to the visual system’s computation of disparity; by taking place within orientation bands, the computation renders the coding of disparity inseparable from the coding of orientation.},

In this paper, we try to substantiate this claim using neuronal simulations of directed spatial attention and biased competition. These simulations assume that neuronal activity encodes a probabilistic representation of the world that optimizes free-energy in a Bayesian fashion. Because free-energy bounds surprise or the (negative) log-evidence for internal models of the world, this optimization can be regarded as evidence accumulation or (generalized) predictive coding. Crucially, both predictions about the state of the world generating sensory data and the precision of those data have to be optimized. Here, we show that if the precision depends on the states, one can explain many aspects of attention. We illustrate this in the context of the Posner paradigm, using the simulations to generate both psychophysical and electrophysiological responses. These simulated responses are consistent with attentional bias or gating, competition for attentional resources, attentional capture and associated speed-accuracy trade-offs. Furthermore, if we present both attended and non-attended stimuli simultaneously, biased competition for neuronal representation emerges as a principled and straightforward property of Bayes-optimal perception.},

Hence, we compare the effect of long-range interactions in parvocellular and magnocellular LGN layers of the marmoset monkey Callithrix jacchus using optimal, incremental spots flashed on the classical receptive field either alone or simultaneously with the shift of a grating (98% contrast; 0.1 cycles/deg) confined to a peripheral annulus (radii: 5-15 deg). The contrast required to drive the response halfway to saturation (c50) of most LGN neurons was raised by remote pattern shifts. The c50 ratio [(shift+spot)/spot] in OFF-center magnocellular neurons was significantly higher than in OFF-center parvocellular neurons. OFF-center magnocellular neurons closer to the fovea (10 deg eccentricity) tended to have a higher c50 ratio than in more peripheral neurons. A significant drop in visual sensitivity to 25% contrast spots was observed during remote motion: d’ fell from 1.8 to 1.4 in parvocellular neurons and from 2.2 to 1.7 in magnocellular neurons. Such long-range interactions produce a reduction in visual sensitivity by changing the gain of the geniculate relay and point to an inhibitory, motion-sensitive extra-classical receptive field in both parvocellular and magnocellular pathways, which may be involved in saccadic suppression and attentional mechanisms in early vision.},

We report here on (1) a summary of the layout of cortical areas associated with vision and with other modalities, (2) a computerized database for storing and representing large amounts of information on connectivity patterns, and (3) the application of these data to the analysis of hierarchical organization of the cerebral cortex. Our analysis concentrates on the visual system, which includes 25 neocortical areas that are predominantly or exclusively visual in function, plus an additional 7 areas that we regard as visual-association areas on the basis of their extensive visual inputs. A total of 305 connections among these 32 visual and visual-association areas have been reported. This represents 31% of the possible number of pathways if each area were connected with all others. The actual degree of connectivity is likely to be closer to 40%. The great majority of pathways involve reciprocal connections between areas. There are also extensive connections with cortical areas outside the visual system proper, including the somatosensory cortex, as well as neocortical, transitional, and archicortical regions in the temporal and frontal lobes. In the somatosensory/motor system, there are 62 identified pathways linking 13 cortical areas, suggesting an overall connectivity of about 40%. Based on the laminar patterns of connections between areas, we propose a hierarchy of visual areas and of somatosensory/motor areas that is more comprehensive than those suggested in other recent studies. The current version of the visual hierarchy includes 10 levels of cortical processing. Altogether, it contains 14 levels if one includes the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus at the bottom as well as the entorhinal cortex and hippocampus at the top. Within this hierarchy, there are multiple, intertwined processing streams, which, at a low level, are related to the compartmental organization of areas V1 and V2 and, at a high level, are related to the distinction between processing centers in the temporal and parietal lobes. However, there are some pathways and relationships (about 10% of the total) whose descriptions do not fit cleanly into this hierarchical scheme for one reason or another. In most instances, though, it is unclear whether these represent genuine exceptions to a strict hierarchy rather than inaccuracies or uncertainities in the reported assignment.},

Orientation selectivity is one property that has frequently been used to distinguish V2 stripes, however, this receptive field property has been found in a high percentage of neurons across V2 compartments. Using quantitative intrinsic cortical imaging, we derived maps of preferred orientation, orientation selectivity, and orientation gradient in thin stripes, thick stripes, and interstripes in area V2. Orientation-selective responses were found in each V2 stripe, but the magnitude and organization of orientation selectivity differed significantly from stripe to stripe. Remarkably, the 2 pale stripes flanking each cytochrome oxidase dense stripe differed significantly in their representation of orientation resulting in their distinction as type-I and type-II interstripes. V2 orientation maps are characterized by clockwise and anticlockwise “orientation pinwheels”, but unlike V1, they are not homogeneously distributed across V2. Furthermore, V2 stripes contain large-scale sequences of preferred orientation. These analyses demonstrate that V2 consists of 4 distinct functional compartments; thick stripes and type-II interstripes, which are strongly orientation selective and thin stripes and type-I interstripes, which are significantly less selective for orientation and exhibit larger orientation gradient magnitudes.},

While spatiotemporal correlations in luminance signals may be decorrelated by neurons in early visual processing stages, higher-order correlations, such as those in the orientation domain, are likely to persist in the input representation until the cortical level. In this study, we first examine orientation correlations in natural stimuli across brief time intervals and across nearby regions of space, and find strong correlations in both domains. We then examine contextual modulation of orientation tuning. We find that both temporal and spatial contexts exert a common influence on orientation tuning, shifting tuning away from the orientation of either the adapting (temporal) or surrounding (spatial) grating. Finally, we incorporate this context-mediated repulsive shift in orientation tuning into a model of cortical responses. We find that a direct result of the shift is a reduction of the redundancy in the population responses evoked by the orientation configurations that are most common in natural stimuli. Thus, cortical neurons may be adapted to the statistics of orientation in natural stimuli in order to increase the efficiency of natural stimulus representation.},

abstract = {Despite the incredible diversity among extant eyes, laws of physics constrain how light can be collected resulting in only eight known optical systems in animal eyes. Surprisingly, all animal eyes share a common molecular strategy using opsin for catching photons, but there are a diverse collection of mechanisms with proteins unrelated to each other used to focus light for vision. However, opsin is expressed in either one of two types of photoreceptor that differ fundamentally in their structure and tissue of origin. Taken together, this collection of observations strongly suggests that eyes have had multiple origins with remarkable convergence due to physics and molecular conservation of the opsin protein. Yet recent work has shown that a family of conserved genes are involved in eye formation despite substantial differences in their structure and origin, leading to a controversy over whether eyes evolved once or repeatedly. A likely resolution of this discussion is that particular genes and genetic programs have become associated with specific features needed for eyes and such suites of genes have been recruited as new eyes evolve. Since specific genes and their products are used repeatedly, it is somewhat difficult to conceptualize their causal relationships relative to evolutionary processes. However, detailed comparison of developmental programs may offer clues about multiple origins.},

The physical properties of light restrict how it can be collected and processed, resulting in only eight known optical systems found in animals.

Our understanding of the source of genetic information used in developmental programs is growing rapidly and reveals distributions of gene expression with substantial overlap in both time and space. Specific genes and their products are used repeatedly, making causal relationships more difficult to discern. The phenomenon of groups of genes acting together seems to be the rule. Throughout evolution, particular genes have become associated with distinct aspects of eye development, and these suites of genes have been recruited repeatedly as new eyes evolved.},

The gene encoding opsin (the primary phototransduction protein) and some developmental genes had very early origins and were recruited repeatedly during eye evolution. Eye lens proteins arose separately and make up a diverse group, many of which were co-opted from other functions.

Then, we tested our theoretical predictions in computer simulations of neuron models (Hodgkin-Huxley and modified quadratic integrate-and-fire), as well as in patch-clamp experiments with real neurons (mitral cells in the olfactory bulb and pyramidal cells in the neocortex). As predicted by our theory, we found that for firing frequencies in the beta/gamma range, spike-time reliability is maximal when the time scale of the input fluctuations (autocorrelation time) is in the range of a few milliseconds (2‚Äì5 ms), coinciding with the time scale of fast synapses, and decreases substantially for faster and slower inputs. Finally, we comment how these findings relate to mechanisms causing neuronal synchronization.},

To investigate the relationship of EBA to the recently mapped retinotopic areas of the MT/V5 cluster (Kolster et al., 2010), we evaluated the proportion of voxels responsive to the presentation of static human bodies (EBA voxels) in each of the four areas of the MT/V5 cluster and neighboring LO and phPIT areas. We evaluated this proportion as both a function of the number of voxels in a given area and the total number of voxels in a broader lateral occipito-temporal cortex (LOTC) ROI. We observed that each of the four retinotopic areas of the MT/V5 cluster includes substantial fractions of EBA voxels, in contrast to the LO and phPIT areas. This proportion was slightly greater in the right than left hemisphere, and did not depend on the control condition. While most EBA voxels in MT/V5 were only body-sensitive, those in pMSTv and pFST were also motion-sensitive. The main locus of EBA voxels outside the MT/V5 cluster was in the LOTC cortex just rostral to the MT/V5 cluster. Although this region contained more EBA voxels than the MT/V5 cluster, the proportion as a function of areal size was much reduced compared to the MT/V5 cluster. Our results show that EBA is not a single cortical area as EBA voxels are located in all four areas of the MT/V5 cluster, and that body-sensitivity is a key feature of the MT/V5 cluster, in keeping with its exquisite sensitivity to observed actions of others.},

abstract = {According to current theory, orientation selectivity in cortical simple cells is critically dependent on intracortical synaptic inhibition. In particular, it is thought that IPSPs evoked by stimuli of the nonpreferred orientation are required to prevent a neuron from responding to a broadly tuned excitatory input at any but the preferred orientation. Yet EPSPs recorded in simple cells are in themselves highly orientation-selective. How is this possible, when excitation arises primarily from relay cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), which are largely insensitive to orientation? In this paper, the properties of EPSPs are compared with the predictions of a model of geniculate excitation of simple cells. The model, which is derived from the suggestions of Hubel and Wiesel (1962), relies on the now familiar arrangement of the receptive fields of presynaptic geniculate cells into lines parallel to the axis of orientation of the postsynaptic cell. Several properties of the EPSPs observed in simple cells, and the orientation tuning of simple cells observed in extracellular experiments, can be accounted for without resorting to intracortical inhibition.},

The feed-forward model posits that this selectivity arises simply from the arrangement of thalamic inputs to a simple cell. Much evidence, including a number of recent intracellular studies, supports a primary role of the thalamic inputs in determining simple cell response properties, including orientation tuning. This mechanism alone, however, cannot explain the invariance of orientation tuning to changes in stimulus contrast. Simple cells receive push-pull inhibition: ON inhibition in OFF subregions and vice versa. Addition of such inhibition to the feed-forward model can account for this contrast invariance, provided the inhibition is sufficiently strong. The predictions of “normalization” and “feedback” models are reviewed and compared with the predictions of this modified feed-forward model and with experimental results.

abstract = {A compelling single case report of visual awareness (visual qualia) without primary visual cortex would be sufficient to refute the hypothesis that the primary visual cortex and the back-projections to it are necessary for conscious visual experience. In a previous study, we emphasized the presence of crude visual awareness in Patient G.Y., with a lesion of the primary visual cortex, who is aware of, and able to discriminate, fast-moving visual stimuli presented to his blind field. The visual nature of Patient G.Y.’s blind field experience has since been questioned and it has been suggested that the special circumstances of repeated testing over decades may have altered Patient G.Y.’s visual pathways. We therefore sought new evidence of visual awareness without primary visual cortex in patients for whom such considerations do not apply. Three patients with hemianopic field defects (Patient G.N. and Patient F.B. with MRI confirmed primary visual cortex lesions, Patient C.G. with an inferred lesion) underwent detailed psychophysical testing in their blind fields. Visual stimuli were presented at different velocities and contrasts in two- and four-direction discrimination experiments and the direction of motion and awareness reported using a forced-choice paradigm. Detailed verbal reports were also obtained of the nature of the blind field experience with comparison of the drawings of the stimulus presented in the blind and intact fields, where possible. All three patients reported visual awareness in their blind fields. Visual awareness was significantly more likely when a moving stimulus was present compared to no stimulus catch trials (P < 0.01 for each subject). Psychophysical performance in Patient F.B. and Patient G.N. was consistent with the Riddoch syndrome, with higher levels of visual awareness for moving compared to static stimuli (P < 0.001) and intact direction discrimination (P < 0.0001 for two- and four-direction experiments). Although the blind field experience of all three subjects was degraded, it was clearly visual in nature. We conclude that the primary visual cortex or back-projections to it are not necessary for visual awareness.},

To understand the representation of images by the mammalian visual system, it might therefore be useful to consider the statistics of images from the natural environment (i.e., images with trees, rocks, bushes, etc). In this study, various coding schemes are compared in relation to how they represent the information in such natural images. The coefficients of such codes are represented by arrays of mechanisms that respond to local regions of space, spatial frequency, and orientation (Gabor-like transforms). For many classes of image, such codes will not be an efficient means of representing information. However, the results obtained with six natural images suggest that the orientation and the spatial-frequency tuning of mammalian simple cells are well suited for coding the information in such images if the goal of the code is to convert higher-order redundancy (e.g., correlation between the intensities of neighboring pixels) into first-order redundancy (i.e., the response distribution of the coefficients). Such coding produces a relatively high signal-to-noise ratio and permits information to be transmitted with only a subset of the total number of cells. These results support Barlow’s theory that the goal of natural vision is to represent the information in the natural environment with minimal redundancy.},

Physiological and anatomical experiments indicated that this rod input arose from the AII amacrine cell‚Äìmediated rod pathway. Rod and cone signals were both present in SBCs at mesopic light levels. These findings have three implications. First, more retinal circuits may multiplex rod and cone signals than were previously thought to, efficiently exploiting the limited number of optic nerve fibers. Second, signals from AII amacrine cells may diverge to most or all of the 20 retinal ganglion cell types in the peripheral primate retina. Third, rod input to SBCs may be the substrate for behavioral biases toward perception of blue at mesopic light levels.},

This description of complex cells seems at odds with the classical energy model in which complex cells receive input from multiple simple cells with overlapping receptive fields. The energy model predicts, and experiments have confirmed, that bar stimuli should facilitate or suppress one another depending on their relative separation. We have recorded intracellularly from a population of complex cells and studied their responses to paired bar stimuli in detail. A wide range of behavior was observed, from the more classical separation-dependent interactions to purely MAX-like responses. We also found that the more MAX-like a cell was, the broader its spatial-frequency tuning as measured with drifting gratings. These observations are consistent with energy models in which classical complex cells receive input from simple cells with similar preferred spatial frequencies, and MAX-like complex cells receive input from simple cells with disparate preferred spatial frequencies. Generalized energy models, then, can account for diverse modes of computation in cortical complex cells.},

By what mechanism does attention improve spatial resolution? An improved signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the attended location contributes, because of retinotopically specific signal gain. Additionally, attention could sharpen position tuning at the neural population level, so that adjacent objects activate more distinct regions of the visual cortex. A dual mechanism involving both signal gain and sharpened position tuning would be highly efficient at improving visual resolution, but there is no direct evidence that attention can narrow the position tuning of population responses. Here, we compared the spatial spread of the fMRI BOLD response for attended versus ignored stimuli. The activity produced by adjacent stimuli overlapped less when subjects were attending at their locations versus attending elsewhere, despite a stronger peak response with attention. Our results show that even as early as primary visual cortex (V1), spatially directed attention narrows the tuning of population-coded position representations.},

Here we characterize how the human pulvinar encodes attended and ignored objects when they appear simultaneously and compete for attentional resources. Using multivoxel pattern analyses on data from two functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments, we show that attention gates both position and orientation information in the pulvinar: attended objects are encoded with high precision, while there is no measurable encoding of ignored objects. These data support a role of the pulvinar in distractor filtering-suppressing information from competing stimuli to isolate behaviourally relevant objects.},

Pretectal inactivation (PTI) resulted in spontaneous nystagmic eye movements in the dark with slow phases directed away from the injected side. In the control situation, all Y-cells and about two thirds of X-cells were excited during saccades or saccade-like visual stimulation but one third of X-cells were inhibited. During PTI all recorded X-cells were inhibited, either during saccades or saccade-like visual stimulation. The PTI-associated inhibition was stronger than in inhibited X-cells in control experiments only during saccades but not during stimulation with a moving pattern while the eyes were stationary. In Y-cells a reduction in the response peak width at half-height was seen during PTI, again only during saccades but not during stimulation with a moving pattern. These results indicate that during saccades the pretecto-geniculate pathway has a stronger influence on X LGNd relay cells than on Y-cells. The findings are discussed in terms of saccadic suppression and postsaccadic facilitation.},

This is followed by a summary of the mechanisms of inhibition in the CNS. With this as a starting point, we provide an overview describing the variations in the subtypes and origins of inhibitory interneurons within the pallial and subpallial divisions of the telencephalon, with a focus on the hippocampus, somatosensory, paleo/piriform cortex, striatum, and various amygdala nuclei. Strikingly, we observe that marked variations exist in the origin and numerical balance between GABAergic interneurons and the principal cell populations in distinct regions of the telencephalon. Finally we speculate regarding the attractiveness and challenges of establishing a unifying nomenclature to describe inhibitory diversity throughout the telencephalon.},

Large injections of retrograde tracers involving all layers of the LGN resulted in a distinctive bilaminar distribution of labeled cells in cortical layer 6. One tier of labeled neurons was located along the layer 5-6 border and a second was located near the bottom of the layer, leaving the middle of layer 6 largely free of labeled neurons. Following injections of tracers that were restricted to the magnocellular layers of the LGN, almost all of the labeled neurons were located in the lower tier. In contrast, following injections of retrograde tracers confined to the parvocellular layers of the LGN, labeled cells were found in both tiers, with the greatest number in the upper tier. Thus, layer 6 of macaque striate cortex consists of three distinct sublayers only two of which are the source of descending projections to the LGN: an upper tier that projects exclusively to the parvocellular layers and a lower tier that projects to both magnocellular and parvocellular layers.

abstract = {The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) transmits visual signals from the retina to the cortex. In the dLGN the antagonism between the centre and the surround of the receptive fields is increased through intrageniculate inhibitory mechanisms. Furthermore, the transmission of signals through the dLGN is modulated in a state-dependent manner by input from various brainstem nuclei including an area in the parabrachial region (PBR) containing cholinergic cells involved in the regulation of arousal and sleep. Here, we studied the effects of increased PBR input on the spatial receptive field properties of cells in the dLGN. We made simultaneous single-unit recordings of the input to the cells from the retina (S-potentials) and the output of the cells to the cortex (action potentials) to determine spatial receptive field modifications generated in the dLGN. State-dependent modulation of the spatial receptive field properties was studied by electrical stimulation of the PBR. The results showed that PBR stimulation had only a minor effect on the modifications of the spatial receptive field properties generated in the dLGN. The PBR-evoked effects could be described mainly as increased response gain. This suggested that the spatial modifications of the receptive field occurred at an earlier stage of processing in the dLGN than the PBR-controlled gain regulation, such that the PBR input modulates the gain of the spatially modified signals. We propose that the spatial receptive field modifications occur at the input to relay cells through the synaptic triades between retinal afferents, inhibitory interneurone dendrites, and relay cell dendrites and that the gain regulation is related to postsynaptic cholinergic effects on the relay cells.},

abstract = {The problem of understanding how ensembles of neurons code for somatosensory information has been defined as a classification problem: given the response of a population of neurons to a set of stimuli, which stimulus generated the response on a single-trial basis? Multivariate statistical techniques such as linear discriminant analysis (LDA) and artificial neural networks (ANNs), and different types of preprocessing stages, such as principal and independent component analysis, have been used to solve this classification problem, with surprisingly small performance differences. Therefore, the goal of this project was to design a new method to maximize computational efficiency rather than classification performance. We developed a peri-stimulus time histogram (PSTH)-based method, which consists of creating a set of templates based on the average neural responses to stimuli and classifying each single trial by assigning it to the stimulus with the ‘closest’ template in the Euclidean distance sense. The PSTH-based method is computationally more efficient than methods as simple as linear discriminant analysis, performs significantly better than discriminant analyses (linear, quadratic or Mahalanobis) when small binsizes are used (1 ms) and as well as LDA with any other binsize, is optimal among other minimum-distance classifiers and can be optimally applied on raw neural data without a previous stage of dimension reduction. We conclude that the PSTH-based method is an efficient alternative to more sophisticated methods such as LDA and ANNs to study how ensemble of neurons code for discrete sensory stimuli, especially when datasets with many variables are used and when the time resolution of the neural code is one of the factors of interest.},

We recorded ensembles of neurons using microwire arrays implanted in the deep layers of the forelimb region of the rat primary somatosensory cortex in response to step stimuli delivered to the cutaneous surface of the contralateral body. We used a recently developed peristimulus time histogram (PSTH)-based classification method to investigate the temporal precision of the code by evaluating how changing the bin size (from 40 to 1 msec) would affect the ability of the ensemble responses to discriminate stimulus location on a single-trial basis. The information related to the discrimination was redundantly distributed within the ensembles, and the ability to discriminate stimulus location increased when decreasing the bin size, reaching a maximum at 4 msec. In our experiment, at 4 msec bin size the first spike per neuron after the stimulus conveyed almost as much information as the entire responses, so the temporal precision of the code was preserved in the first spikes. Subsequent spikes were less frequent but conveyed more information per spike. Finally, not only the trials correctly classified but also the trials incorrectly classified conveyed information about stimulus location with a similar temporal precision. We conclude that the role of spike timing in cortical somatosensory processing is not an exclusive feature of the highly specialized rat trigeminal system, but a more general property of the rat primary somatosensory cortex.},

This leads naturally to the recent data that can be interpreted to suggest that even brief experience can change sensory responses via changes in network states and that trial-to-trial variability in sensory responses is a nonrandom function of network fluctuations, as well. We suggest that the CNS may have evolved specifically to deal with stimulus variability and that the coupling with network states may be central to sensory processing.},

Intracellular recordings revealed that the relative weights of simple-like and complex-like receptive field components were scaled so as to make the same receptive field more simple-like with dense noise stimulation and more complex-like with sparse or Gabor noise stimulations. However, once these context-dependent receptive fields were convolved with the corresponding stimulus, the balance between simple-like and complex-like contributions to the synaptic responses appeared to be invariant across input statistics. This normalization of the linear/nonlinear input ratio suggests a previously unknown form of homeostatic control of V1 functional properties, optimizing the network nonlinearities to the statistical structure of the visual input.},

abstract = {Binocular rivalry is the alternating perception that occurs when incompatible stimuli are presented to the two eyes: one monocular stimulus dominates vision and then the other stimulus dominates, with a perceptual switch occurring every few seconds. There is a need for a binocular rivalry model that accounts for both well-established results on the timing of dominance intervals, and for more recent evidence on the distributed neural processing of rivalry. The model for binocular rivalry developed here consists of four parallel visual channels, two driven by the left eye, and two by the right. Each channel consists of several consecutive processing stages representing successively higher cortical levels, with mutual inhibition between the channels at each stage. All stages are architecturally identical. With n the number of stages, the model is implemented as 4n nonlinear differential equations using a total of eight parameters. Despite the simplicity of its architecture, the model accounts for a variety of experimental observations: 1. the increasing depth of rivalry at higher cortical areas, as shown in electrophysiological, imaging, and psychophysical experiments; 2. the unimodal probability density of dominance durations, where the mode is less than the mean; 3. the lack of correlation between successive dominance durations; 4. the effect of interocular stimulus differences on dominance duration; 5. eye suppression, as opposed to feature suppression. The model is potentially applicable to issues of visual processing more general than binocular rivalry.},

Furthermore, cells were tuned to the geometry of facial features. Tuning was most often ramp-shaped, with a one-to-one mapping of feature magnitude to firing rate. Tuning amplitude depended on the presence of a whole, upright face and features were interpreted according to their position in a whole, upright face. Thus, cells in the middle face patch encode axes of a face space specialized for whole, upright faces.},

The tuning of individual MCs was not sharpened during this process. Hence, the individual responses of MCs did not become more specific, but the odor-coding MC assemblies changed such that their overlap decreased. This optimization of ensemble representations did not occur among olfactory afferents but resulted from OB circuit dynamics.

During interocular rivalry, there is competition between the two nonfusible stimuli presented to the two eyes, and only one stimulus is selected at any time. We biased this competition in three different ways: (1) we exploited the condition that in strabismic cats there is often one dominant eye that is selected for most of the time. (2) We presented the two stimuli with a temporal offset, which biases competition in favor of the newly appearing stimulus. (3) We presented the two stimuli with highly different contrasts, which biases competition in favor of the stimulus with higher contrast. Whenever competition was biased in favor of the stimulus activating the recorded neurons, gamma-frequency synchronization of the respective responses was enhanced, and vice versa. Firing rates showed some differences between stimulation conditions. However, when present, these changes were inversely related to a competitive advantage of the respective stimulus. We hypothesize that enhanced gamma-frequency synchronization in primary visual cortex is a correlate of stimulus selection. Synchronization is likely to be translated into firing rate changes at later processing stages},

abstract = {Spontaneous brain activity could affect processing if it were structured. We show that neuron pairs in cat primary visual cortex exhibited correlated fluctuations in response latency, particularly when they had overlapping receptive fields or similar orientation preferences. Correlations occurred within and across hemispheres, but only when local field potentials (LFPs) oscillated in the gamma-frequency range (40-70 Hz). In this range, LFP fluctuations preceding response onset predicted response latencies; negative (positive) LFPs were associated with early (late) responses. Oscillations below 10 Hz caused covariations in response amplitude, but exhibited no columnar selectivity or coordinating effect on latencies. Thus, during high gamma activity, spontaneous activity exhibits distinct, column-specific correlation patterns. Consequently, cortical cells undergo coherent fluctuations in excitability that enhance temporal coherence of responses to contours that are spatially contiguous or have similar orientation. Because synchronized responses are more likely than dispersed responses to undergo rapid and joint processing, spontaneous activity may be important in early visual processes Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

abstract = {This article concerns the nature of evoked brain responses and the principles underlying their generation. We start with the premise that the sensory brain has evolved to represent or infer the causes of changes in its sensory inputs. The problem of inference is well formulated in statistical terms. The statistical fundaments of inference may therefore afford important constraints on neuronal implementation. By formulating the original ideas of Helmholtz on perception, in terms of modern-day statistical theories, one arrives at a model of perceptual inference and learning that can explain a remarkable range of neurobiological facts.It turns out that the problems of inferring the causes of sensory input (perceptual inference) and learning the relationship between input and cause (perceptual learning) can be resolved using exactly the same principle. Specifically, both inference and learning rest on minimizing the brain’s free energy, as defined in statistical physics. Furthermore, inference and learning can proceed in a biologically plausible fashion. Cortical responses can be seen as the brain’s attempt to minimize the free energy induced by a stimulus and thereby encode the most likely cause of that stimulus. Similarly, learning emerges from changes in synaptic efficacy that minimize the free energy, averaged over all stimuli encountered. The underlying scheme rests on empirical Bayes and hierarchical models of how sensory input is caused. The use of hierarchical models enables the brain to construct prior expectations in a dynamic and context-sensitive fashion. This scheme provides a principled way to understand many aspects of cortical organization and responses. The aim of this article is to encompass many apparently unrelated anatomical, physiological and psychophysical attributes of the brain within a single theoretical perspective. In terms of cortical architectures, the theoretical treatment predicts that sensory cortex should be arranged hierarchically, that connections should be reciprocal and that forward and backward connections should show a functional asymmetry (forward connections are driving, whereas backward connections are both driving and modulatory). In terms of synaptic physiology, it predicts associative plasticity and, for dynamic models, spike-timing-dependent plasticity. In terms of electrophysiology, it accounts for classical and extra classical receptive field effects and long-latency or endogenous components of evoked cortical responses. It predicts the attenuation of responses encoding prediction error with perceptual learning and explains many phenomena such as repetition suppression, mismatch negativity (MMN) and the P300 in electroencephalography. In psychophysical terms, it accounts for the behavioural correlates of these physiological phenomena, for example, priming and global precedence. The final focus of this article is on perceptual learning as measured with the MMN and the implications for empirical studies of coupling among cortical areas using evoked sensory responses.},

This Review looks at some key brain theories in the biological (for example, neural Darwinism) and physical (for example, information theory and optimal control theory) sciences from the free-energy perspective. Crucially, one key theme runs through each of these theories - optimization. Furthermore, if we look closely at what is optimized, the same quantity keeps emerging, namely value (expected reward, expected utility) or its complement, surprise (prediction error, expected cost). This is the quantity that is optimized under the free-energy principle, which suggests that several global brain theories might be unified within a free-energy framework.},

In this work, we explore the idea that saccadic eye movements are optimal experiments, in which data are gathered to test hypotheses or beliefs about how those data are caused. This provides a plausible model of visual search that can be motivated from the basic principles of self-organized behavior: namely, the imperative to minimize the entropy of hidden states of the world and their sensory consequences. This imperative is met if agents sample hidden states of the world efficiently. This efficient sampling of salient information can be derived in a fairly straightforward way, using approximate Bayesian inference and variational free-energy minimization. Simulations of the resulting active inference scheme reproduce sequential eye movements that are reminiscent of empirically observed saccades and provide some counterintuitive insights into the way that sensory evidence is accumulated or assimilated into beliefs about the world.},

It is fairly easy to show that making inferences about the causes of sensory data can be cast as the minimization of a free-energy bound on the likelihood of sensory inputs, given an internal model of how they were caused. In this article, we consider what would happen if the data themselves were sampled to minimize this bound. It transpires that the ensuing active sampling or inference is mandated by ergodic arguments based on the very existence of adaptive agents. Furthermore, it accounts for many aspects of motor behavior; from retinal stabilization to goal-seeking. In particular, it suggests that motor control can be understood as fulfilling prior expectations about proprioceptive sensations. This formulation can explain why adaptive behavior emerges in biological agents and suggests a simple alternative to optimal control theory. We illustrate these points using simulations of oculomotor control and then apply to same principles to cued and goal-directed movements. In short, the free-energy formulation may provide an alternative perspective on the motor control that places it in an intimate relationship with perception.},

Visually induced population activity in PT nuclei was achieved by a moving (or counterphasing) grating which was presented in the background of the light spot used to stimulate the dLGN neuron. As a control, the light spot was presented on a stationary grating to avoid stimulation of PT neurons but to yield the same illumination of the background. Extracellularly recorded dLGN relay cells of the X- and Y-type were found to be differentially affected by the PT-dLGN projection. During visual stimulation of PT cells, X cells were strongly inhibited and this effect was significantly reduced during PT inactivation. By contrast, the visual responses of most Y cells were affected neither by PT stimulation nor by PT inactivation. In addition, the temporal structure of spike patterns during the light response was examined with autocorrelograms and spike-interval distributions. X-on cells often exhibited a multimodal interval distribution and oscillatory type of activity. During stimulation of the PT interval distributions changed in a characteristic manner and oscillations disappeared. Both effects could be almost totally cancelled by PT inactivation. By contrast, the temporal structure of Y-cell responses was not affected. Our results demonstrate for the first time a pretectal modulation of retino-geniculate transmission in cat dLGN which is clearly different for X and Y cells. This influence seems to be mediated via (inhibitory) interneurons, since we found no indication for a direct coupling between PT and dLGN units. This projection might contribute to the well-known phenomenon of saccadic suppression.},

In many cases, PGN cells showed an activity pattern which appeared like a mirror image of distinct periods of dLGN activity. Flashing spots evoked transient volleys of activity in PGN cells which increased in strength and shortened in latency with increasing size of the stimulus. These responses were temporally matched with inhibitory phases in the early part of visual responses in the dLGN. The spatio-temporal properties of the RFs were established by reverse correlation of the spike activity with the spatially random presentation of bright and dark spots within an array of 20 x 20 positions. Anticorrelated firing patterns of such kind could also be elicited as interocular inhibition with stimulation of the perigeniculate RF in the nondominant eye. Inversely correlated changes in spontaneous and visually induced activity were also visible during spontaneous changes in EEG pattern. With increasing synchronization of the EEG (predominance of delta-waves) the strength of geniculate visual responses declined while maintained perigeniculate activity increased. A weakened interocular and monocular inhibition of dLGN relay cells during visual stimulation of PGN RFs could be achieved with local reversible inactivation of PGN areas topographically matched with the dLGN recording sites. The results indicate that the PGN contributes to the state-dependent control of retino-geniculate transmission and to the monocular and interocular inhibitory processes that shape the visual responses in the dLGN.},

A biophysically realistical simulation of the retino-cortical pathway, including excitatory corticogeniculate feedback, produced a similar effect, Without the feedback the mean firing rate in the LGN dropped and interval peaks broadened by an average of 25%.

abstract = {The lobula giant movement detector (LGMD) is an identified neuron in the locust visual system that responds preferentially to objects approaching on a collision course with the animal. For such looming stimuli, the LGMD firing rate gradually increases, peaks, and decays toward the end of approach. The LGMD receives both excitatory and feed-forward inhibitory inputs on distinct branches of its dendritic tree, but little is known about the contribution of feed-forward inhibition to its response properties. We used picrotoxin, a chloride channel blocker, to selectively block feed-forward inhibition to the LGMD. We then computed differences in firing rate and membrane potential between control and picrotoxin conditions to study the activation of feed-forward inhibition. For looming stimuli, a significant activation of inhibition was observed early, as objects exceeded on average 23¬∞ in angular extent at the retina. Inhibition then increased in parallel with excitation over the remainder of approach trials. Experiments in which the final angular size of the approaching objects was systematically varied revealed that the relative activation of excitation and inhibition remains well balanced over most of the course of looming trials. Feed-forward inhibition actively contributed to the termination of the response to approaching objects and was particularly effective for large or slowly moving objects. Suddenly appearing and receding objects activated excitation and feed-forward inhibition nearly simultaneously, in contrast to looming stimuli. Under these conditions, the activation of excitation and feed-forward inhibition was weaker than for approaching objects, suggesting that both are preferentially tuned to approaching objects. These results support a phenomenological model of multiplication within the LGMD and provide new constraints for biophysical models of its responses to looming and receding stimuli},

We describe here the properties of a newly discovered set of F5 neurons (”mirror neurons’, n = 92) all of which became active both when the monkey performed a given action and when it observed a similar action performed by the experimenter. Mirror neurons, in order to be visually triggered, required an interaction between the agent of the action and the object of it. The sight of the agent alone or of the object alone (three-dimensional objects, food) were ineffective. Hand and the mouth were by far the most effective agents. The actions most represented among those activating mirror neurons were grasping, manipulating and placing. In most mirror neurons (92%) there was a clear relation between the visual action they responded to and the motor response they coded. In approximately 30% of mirror neurons the congruence was very strict and the effective observed and executed actions corresponded both in terms of general action (e.g. grasping) and in terms of the way in which that action was executed (e.g. precision grip). We conclude by proposing that mirror neurons form a system for matching observation and execution of motor actions. We discuss the possible role of this system in action recognition and, given the proposed homology between F5 and human Brocca’s region, we posit that a matching system, similar to that of mirror neurons exists in humans and could be involved in recognition of actions as well as phonetic gestures.},

We used visuotopic mapping with blood oxygen level-dependent functional magnetic resonance imaging signals to define 12 human visual cortical areas, and then determined whether the reference frame in each area was spatiotopic or retinotopic. We found that all 12 areas, including MT, represented stimuli in a retinotopic reference frame. Although there were patches of cortex in and around these visual areas that were ostensibly spatiotopic, none of these patches exhibited reliable stimulus-evoked responses. We conclude that the early, visuotopically organized visual cortical areas in the human brain (like their counterparts in the monkey brain) represent stimuli in a retinotopic reference frame.},

Notably, the unique age-predictive power of the SD-based pattern was more than five times that of the mean-based pattern.

abstract = {Retinal ganglion cells react to changes in visual contrast by adjusting their sensitivity and temporal filtering characteristics. This contrast adaptation has primarily been studied under spatially homogeneous stimulation. Yet, ganglion cell receptive fields are often characterized by spatial subfields, providing a substrate for nonlinear spatial processing. This raises the question whether contrast adaptation follows a similar subfield structure or whether it occurs globally over the receptive field even for local stimulation. We therefore recorded ganglion cell activity in isolated salamander retinas while locally changing visual contrast. Ganglion cells showed primarily global adaptation characteristics, with notable exceptions in certain aspects of temporal filtering. Surprisingly, some changes in filtering were most pronounced for locations where contrast did not change. This seemingly paradoxical effect can be explained by a simple computational model, which emphasizes the importance of local nonlinearities in the retina and suggests a reevaluation of previously reported local contrast adaptation.},

Taking into consideration the response properties to static or moving stimuli as well as the organization of the receptive fields, units isolated in the pulvinar were subdivided into 8 groups. Units displaying dynamic properties predominate over static ones. Static units were classified in 3 groups; of these, one showed uniform receptive fields; the remaining two groups, with non-uniform RFs, were further subdivided in terms of orientation selectivity. By testing for directional sensitivity, organization of the RFs and orientation selectivity, the dynamic units were divided in 5 groups. Among these there was a predominance of directional units, displaying uniform RFs and showing orientation selectivity. Although the receptive fields would extend into the ipsilateral hemifield (up to 10 degrees), their centers were always located in the contralateral visual hemifield. Binocularly driven units predominate in both static and dynamic categories.},

Although the topographic organization of V4’s connections with other cortical areas has been established, the detailed topography of its connections with subcortical areas is unclear. We therefore injected retrograde and anterograde tracers in different topographical regions of V4 in nine macaques to determine the organization of its subcortical connections. The injection sites included representations ranging from the fovea to far peripheral eccentricities in both the upper and lower visual fields. The topographically organized connections of V4 included bidirectional connections with four subdivisions of the pulvinar, two subdivisions of the claustrum, and the interlaminar portions of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and efferent projections to the superficial and intermediate layers of the superior colliculus, the thalamic reticular nucleus, and the caudate nucleus. All of these structures have a possible role in spatial attention. The nontopographic, or converging, connections included bidirectional connections with the lateral nucleus of the amygdala, afferent inputs from the dorsal raphe, median raphe, locus coeruleus, ventral tegmentum and nucleus basalis of Meynert, and efferent projections to the putamen. Any role of these structures in attention may be less spatially specific.},

Many sensory neurons exhibit contrast normalization: gain depends on the range of stimuli presented, such that firing-rate modulation is not proportional to contrast. However, coding depends strongly on the precision of spike timing and the reliability of spike number, neither of which can be predicted from neural gain. The presumption that contrast normalization is associated with maintained coding efficiency remained untested. We report that, as contrast decreases, responses are more variable and encode less information, as expected. Nevertheless, these changes can be small, and information transmission is even better preserved across contrasts than rate modulation. The extent of contrast normalization is correlated with the extent to which information transmission is preserved across contrasts. Specifically, normalization is associated with maintaining the bits of information per spike rather than bits per second. Finally, we show that a nonadapting model can exhibit both contrast normalization and the associated information preservation.},

abstract = {Sensory neurons appear to adapt their gain to match the variance of signals along the dimension they encode, a property we shall call “contrast normalization”. Contrast normalization has been the subject of extensive physiological and theoretical study. We previously found that neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) exhibit contrast normalization in their responses to full-field flickering white-noise stimuli, and that neurons with the strongest contrast normalization best preserved information transmission across a range of contrasts. We have also shown that both of these properties could be reproduced by non-adapting model cells. Here we present a detailed comparison of this non-adapting model to physiological data from the LGN. First, the model cells recapitulated other contrast dependencies of LGN responses: decreasing stimulus contrast resulted in an increase in spike-timing jitter and spike-number variability. Second, we find that the extent of contrast normalization in this model depends on model parameters related to refractoriness and to noise. Third, we show that the model cells exhibit rapid, transient changes in firing rate just after changes in contrast, and that this is sufficient to produce the transient changes in information transmission that have been reported in other neurons. It is known that intrinsic properties of neurons change upon contrast adaptation. Nevertheless the model demonstrates that the spiking nonlinearity of neurons can produce many of the temporal aspects of contrast gain control, including normalization to input variance and transient effects of contrast change.},

abstract = {1. For the experiments reported in these papers, we recorded the responses of lateral geniculate (LGN) neurons to a large set of two-dimensional, black and white patterns based on Walsh functions and to a set of test stimuli. In the first two papers we reported that these neurons encode stimulus-related information in both the strength and the shape of the response waveforms and that there are more than two independent components in the response. These results cannot be explained by existing models. This paper provides a model of LGN neurons that not only accounts for the foregoing observations, but also yields predictions confirmed by direct tests. 2. The model represents a neuron as a set of three parallel channels. The input to each channel is an array of pixel luminances. Each channel consists of an input nonlinearity cascaded into a linear spatial-to-temporal filter. The output of each channel is a basic waveform, a principal component. The response of the neuron is the sum of the outputs of the three channels. 3. The model accounted for much of the variance in the coefficients of the first three principal components of the neuronal responses to the set of Walsh stimuli. Using parameters derived from the responses of neurons to the Walsh stimuli only, the model also predicted the responses to “center-surround” annuli of different contrasts and mean luminances, as well as to superpositions of pairs of Walsh patterns. The model made statistically significant predictions of the coefficients of two of the principal components of these responses. 4. After the parameters of the model had been fit to reproduce the responses of neurons to the Walsh stimuli, we found that the input nonlinearity of the model was compressed at both the high and low luminance levels. This compression produced response saturation that closely resembled the response saturation of neurons reported in the first paper in this series. Although not absolutely smooth, the spatial filter for the first channel had a dominant excitatory or inhibitory center and an antagonistic surround. Thus this spatial filter accounted for both the center and the surround structures of previous models of LGN receptive fields. There was greater variety in the structures of the spatial filters for the second and third channels, but none had a center-surround organization. Many of the spatial filters for these higher channels contained oriented ridges or valleys. Other spatial filters were dominated by a bipolar pair of pixels. 5. The model of LGN neurons that we present in this paper represents an extension over previous models in four ways. First, the model is capable of explaining the responses of neurons to a wider range of luminances than previous models. Second, the model is capable of explaining the shapes of the response waveforms as well as their magnitudes. Third, the concept of a single receptive field is extended to a series of spatial-to-temporal filters. Fourth, the model suggests that LGN neurons provide a description of both the brightness and the form of a stimulus in their response waveforms.},

abstract = {Previous studies of the cortical input to the mammalian dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) have identified a number of possible functions for the corticogeniculate pathway, including alteration of LGN spatial frequency selectivity and facilitation of both binocular interactions and orientation selectivity. These changes may be due to either a tonic or a phasic cortical facilitation or both. The temporal differences between each of these inputs suggests that their impact on LGN cell temporal tuning should be unique. To test this hypothesis, we reversibly blocked the visual cortex (VI) and measured the effects on several indices of the temporal properties of LGN cells, including peak frequency, bandwidth, and response phase. Macaque monkeys were anesthetized and paralyzed during single cell recording from the LGN while area VI was cryogenically deactivated. Single-cell responses were visually evoked with drifting, luminance-modulated, sine-wave gratings and discrete-Fourier analyzed. Cortical cooling produced statistically significant increases or decreases in response amplitude in 64% of cells recorded. In most cases, alterations in response amplitude occurred for stimuli that varied in spatial as well as temporal frequency. For those cells influenced by changes in stimulus temporal frequency, the majority showed changes over a broad range of frequencies. A minority of cells showed changes in either peak temporal tuning or temporal frequency bandwidth. Response phase angles for all temporal frequencies tested were unaffected by cortical cooling. Overall, these results suggest that the cortical input may alter the temporal response properties of LGN cells, perhaps by tonic, but not exclusively excitatory, corticofugal influences.},

We recorded the responses of 26 pairs of adjacent complex cells in the primary visual cortex of two awake monkeys while using both a set of 16 bar-like stimuli, and a more complex set of 128 two-dimensional patterns. Linear regression showed that 40% of the signal variance of one neuron was related to that of the other when the responses to the bar-like stimuli were considered. However, when the responses to the two-dimensional stimuli were included in the analysis, only 19% of the signal variance of one neuron was related to that of the adjacent one, almost exactly the same results as found in IT. An information theoretic analysis gave similar results. We hypothesize that this trend toward independence of information processing by adjacent cortical neurons is a general organizational strategy used to maximize the amount of information carried in local groups.},

Accordingly, it has been demonstrated that threatening visual input elicits faster behavioral responses than non-threatening visual input. Considering that awareness is a prerequisite for performing demanding tasks and guiding novel behavior, we hypothesized that threatening visual input would gain faster access to awareness than non-threatening visual input. In the present study, we associated one of two basic visual stimuli, that were devoid of intrinsic relevance (colored annuli), with aversive stimulation (i.e., electric shocks) following a classical fear conditioning procedure. In the subsequent test phase no more electric shocks were delivered, and a breaking continuous flash suppression task was used to measure how fast these stimuli would access awareness. The results reveal that stimuli that were previously paired with an electric shock break through suppression faster than comparable stimuli that were not paired with an electric shock.},

Findings concerning the segregation of motion and color information have been at the forefront of the evidence in favor of the parallel processing scheme. A number of studies have shown that motion perception is impaired for isoluminant stimuli, which are thought to isolate the color system. However, there are now many studies, the results of which are incompatible with the simple idea of segregated pathways. We propose two processing streams for motion that differ mostly in their temporal characteristics. Although neither of the two motion streams is color-blind, as was originally suggested, they differ radically in the way they process color information. The view that we propose provides a framework that reconciles a number of seemingly contradictory results.

V3 receives Inputs from both magno- and parvocellular pathways and has prominent projections to both the middle temporal area (area MT) and V4. It may therefore represent an important site for integration and transformation of visual signals. We recorded the activity of single units representing the central 10 degrees in anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. We measured each cell’s spatial, temporal, chromatic, and motion properties with the use of a variety of stimuli. Results were compared with measurements made in V2 neurons at similar eccentricities. Similar to area V2, most of the neurons in our sample (80%) were orientation selective, and the distribution of orientation bandwidths was similar to that found in V2. Neurons in V3 preferred lower spatial and higher temporal frequencies than V2 neurons. Contrast thresholds of V3 neurons were extremely low. Achromatic contrast sensitivity was much higher than in V2, and similar to that found in MT. About 40% of all neurons showed strong directional selectivity. We did not find strongly directional cells in layer 4 of V3, the layer in which the bulk of V1 and V2 inputs terminate. This property seems to be developed within area V3. An analysis of the responses of directionally selective cells to plaid patterns showed that in area V3, as in MT and unlike in V1 and V2, there exist cells sensitive to the motion of the plaid pattern rather than to that of the components. The exact proportion of cells classified as being selective to color depended to a large degree on the experiment and on the criteria used for classification. With the use of the same conditions as in a previous study of V2 cells, we found as many (54%) color-selective cells as in V2 (50%). Furthermore, the responses of V3 cells to colored sinusoidal gratings were well described by a linear combination of cone inputs. The two subpopulations of cells responsive to color and to motion overlapped to a large extent, and we found a significant proportion of cells that gave reliable and directional responses to drifting isoluminant gratings. Our results show that there is a significant interaction between color and motion processing in area V3, and that V3 cells exhibit the more complex motion properties typically observed at later stages of visual processing},

Here I consider another potential neural mechanism for determining motion direction. When a localized image feature moves fast enough, it should become smeared in space owing to temporal integration in the visual system, creating a spatial signal-a ‘motion streak’-oriented in the direction of the motion. The orientation masking and adaptation experiments reported here show that these spatial signals for motion direction exist in the human visual system for feature speeds above about 1 feature width per 100 ms. Computer simulations show that this psychophysical finding is consistent with the known response properties of V1 neurons, and that these spatial signals, when appropriately processed, are sufficient to determine motion direction in natural images.},

Both local mean luminance and contrast were parametrically and randomly varied over the 1-1.5 log unit ranges that are typical of natural images. We find that responses are strongly modulated by both the local mean luminance and contrast, but in an approximately separable manner: the contrast response function is approximately invariant except for a scale factor that depends on the local mean luminance. The shape of the temporal response profiles were found to be approximately invariant with contrast, but were strongly affected by the local mean luminance.

abstract = {When an image feature moves with sufficient speed it should become smeared across space, due to temporal integration in the visual system, effectively creating a spatial motion pattern that is oriented in the direction of the motion. Recent psychophysical evidence shows that such “motion streak signals” exist in the human visual system. In this study, we report neurophysiological evidence that these motion streak signals also exist in the primary visual cortex of cat and monkey. Single neuron responses were recorded for two kinds of moving stimuli: single spots presented at different velocities and drifting plaid patterns presented at different spatial and temporal frequencies. Measurements were made for motion perpendicular to the spatial orientation of the receptive field (”perpendicular motion”) and for motion parallel to the spatial orientation of the receptive field (”parallel motion”). For moving spot stimuli, as the speed increases, the ratio of the responses to parallel versus perpendicular motion increases, and above some critical speed, the response to parallel motion exceeds the response to perpendicular motion. For moving plaid patterns, the average temporal tuning function is approximately the same for both parallel motion and perpendicular motion; in contrast, the spatial tuning function is quite different for parallel motion and perpendicular motion (band pass for the former and low pass for the latter). In general, the responses to spots and plaids are consistent with the conventional model of cortical neurons with one rather surprising exception: Many cortical neurons appear to be direction selective for parallel motion. We propose a simple explanation for “parallel motion direction selectivity” and discuss its implications for the motion streak hypothesis. Taken as a whole, we find that the measured response properties of cortical neurons to moving spot and plaid patterns agree with the recent psychophysics and support the hypothesis that motion streak signals are present in V1.},

abstract = {PURPOSE/AIM: The aim of the study was to investigate the long-term functional changes that may occur in the retina and visual cortex in a rat ocular hypertension (OHT) model of glaucoma, used in our lab for treatment studies, using electroretinogram (ERG) and visual-evoked potential (VEP) cortical recordings in order to test the hypothesis that experimental glaucoma has differential retinal and central effects. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Experimental glaucoma was induced unilaterally in Dark Agouti rats using hypertonic saline injection into the episcleral veins. After 3, 8, 16 and 26 weeks, ERGs and VEPs were recorded under scotopic conditions using brief full-field white flashes (10 μcd s m(-2) to 10.4 cd s m(-2)) and under photopic conditions using a rod-adapting background and white light flashes (0.13-10.4 cd s m(-2)). RESULTS: At 16 and 26 weeks after OHT induction, there was a significant reduction in the amplitudes of the a- (50% and 30% of unoperated eye values, respectively) and b-waves (55% and 40%, respectively) of the scotopic ERG and the b-waves of the photopic ERG (55% and 45%, respectively) in the glaucomatous eyes. However, no significant changes in the VEPs simultaneously recorded over the visual cortex were seen at any of the time points. CONCLUSIONS: The reductions in ERG amplitudes suggest that this model of glaucoma not only causes retinal ganglion cell (RGC) degeneration but also degeneration of the outer retinal cells, and this was confirmed by histology showing a reduction in the outer retinal layers in the glaucomatous eyes. Cortical VEPs did not show detrimental effects suggesting that the retinal damage in this model was not extensive enough to be detected with the VEP methods used or that there could be central compensation in this model of glaucoma.},

This expectation has been contradicted by evidence that adaptation sometimes decreases sensitivity for the adapting stimuli, and sometimes it changes sensitivity for stimuli very different from the adapting ones. We hypothesize that this pattern of results can be explained by a process that optimizes sensitivity for many stimuli, rather than changing sensitivity only for those stimuli whose statistics have changed. To test this hypothesis, we measured visual sensitivity across a broad range of spatiotemporal modulations of luminance, while varying the distribution of stimulus speeds. The manipulation of stimulus statistics caused a large-scale reorganization of visual sensitivity, forming the orderly pattern of sensitivity gains and losses. This pattern is predicted by a theory of distribution of receptive field characteristics in the visual system.},

TMS might also be used in non-human primates to complement invasive work and compare with human studies. Here, we targeted the frontal eye fields (FEF) in two macaques with a continuous theta-burst (cTBS) protocol, testing the impact on visually guided saccades. After unilateral cTBS over the FEF in either hemisphere, a small (mean 7 ms) but highly consistent decrease in saccadic reaction times (RTs) was observed. Lower latencies arose for saccades both contra- and ipsilateral to the stimulated FEF after cTBS. These results provide the first demonstration that TMS can be used to affect saccadic behavior in non-human primates. The unexpectedly bilateral impact on RTs may reflect an impact on ‘fixation’ neurons in the FEF and/or transcallosal modulation of both FEFs induced by unilateral cTBS. In either case, this study demonstrates a clear behavioral effect induced by TMS in awake behaving monkeys performing a cognitive task. This opens new opportunities for investigating the causal roles of targeted brain areas in behavior, for measuring physiological consequences of TMS in the primate brain, and ultimately for human-monkey comparisons.},

abstract = {An increasing number of laboratories are studying population properties of the nervous system using data where the spike activity of more than one neuron is recorded on each electrode and where, accidentally or deliberately, these activities are not resolved into single unit spike trains. We have previously examined the consequences for measurement of cross-correlation between two such electrodes in the limited case where all individual distant (between electrode) correlations are the same and all individual close (on a single electrode) correlations are the same [Bedenbaugh, P.H., and Gerstein, G.L. (1997). Multiunit normalized cross correlation differs from the average single-unit normalized correlation. Neural Computation 9, 1265-1275]. Here, we lift these unrealistic restrictions to allow all values of individual correlation, and examine explicitly the cases of two or three unresolved neurons on each electrode. In these situations, the cross-correlation coefficient measured between the electrodes is a linear sum of the distant correlations, divided by a non-linear function of the close correlations. We then examine in detail the case of a single direct distant correlation and take account of all relevant indirect correlations. The measured interelectrode correlation shows a reduction of this actual distant correlation by a non-linear function of the close correlations on each electrode over most of their possible values. Finally, we examine the consequences of poor waveform sorting for correlation measures; here a supposedly isolated spike train is contaminated by some fraction of the activity of another train, a situation that unfortunately is all too common in experiments. All these distortions become far more serious in the more realistic situation of dynamic firing rates and correlations. This paper is intended as a cautionary note for those who want to draw inferences about neuronal organization and/or coding or representation by using cross-correlation analysis of unresolved recordings},

Mounting evidence suggests that the neural underpinnings of multisensory integration extend into early sensory processing. This article examines the notion that neocortical operations are essentially multisensory. We first review what is known about multisensory processing in higher-order association cortices and then discuss recent anatomical and physiological findings in presumptive unimodal sensory areas. The pervasiveness of multisensory influences on all levels of cortical processing compels us to reconsider thinking about neural processing in unisensory terms. Indeed, the multisensory nature of most, possibly all, of the neocortex forces us to abandon the notion that the senses ever operate independently during real-world cognition.},

Computational modeling is a valuable tool toward understanding the processes involved in invariant object recognition. Although recent computational models have shown outstanding performances on challenging image databases, they fail to perform well in image categorization under more complex image variations. Studies have shown that making sparse representation of objects by extracting more informative visual features through a feedforward sweep can lead to higher recognition performances. Here, however, we show that when the complexity of image variations is high, even this approach results in poor performance compared to humans. To assess the performance of models and humans in invariant object recognition tasks, we built a parametrically controlled image database consisting of several object categories varied in different dimensions and levels, rendered from 3D planes. Comparing the performance of several object recognition models with human observers shows that only in low-level image variations the models perform similar to humans in categorization tasks. Furthermore, the results of our behavioral experiments demonstrate that, even under difficult experimental conditions (i.e., briefly presented masked stimuli with complex image variations), human observers performed outstandingly well, suggesting that the models are still far from resembling humans in invariant object recognition. Taken together, we suggest that learning sparse informative visual features, although desirable, is not a complete solution for future progresses in object-vision modeling. We show that this approach is not of significant help in solving the computational crux of object recognition (i.e., invariant object recognition) when the identity-preserving image variations become more complex.},

abstract = {Although many studies have shown that the activity of individual neurons in a variety of visual areas is modulated by attention, a fundamental question remains unresolved: can attention alter the visual representations of individual neurons? One set of studies, primarily relying on the attentional modulations observed when a single stimulus is presented within the receptive field of a neuron, suggests that neuronal selectivities, such as orientation or direction tuning, are not fundamentally altered by attention (Salinas and Abbott, 1997; McAdams and Maunsell, 1999; Treue and Martinez Trujillo, 1999). Another set of studies, relying on modulations observed when multiple stimuli are presented within a receptive field, suggests that attention can alter the weighting of sensory inputs (Moran and Desimone, 1985; Luck et al., 1997; Reynolds et al., 1999; Chelazzi et al., 2001). In these studies, when preferred and nonpreferred stimuli are simultaneously presented, responses are much stronger when attention is directed to the preferred stimulus than when it is directed to the nonpreferred stimulus. In this study, we recorded neuronal responses from individual neurons in visual cortical area V4 to both single and paired stimuli with a variety of attentional allocations and stimulus combinations. For each neuron studied, we constructed a quantitative model of input summation and then tested various models of attention. In many neurons, we are able to explain neuronal responses across the entire range of stimuli and attentional allocations tested. Specifically, we are able to reconcile seemingly inconsistent observations of single and paired stimuli attentional modulation with a new model in which attention can facilitate or suppress specific inputs to a neuron but does not fundamentally alter the integration of these inputs.},

To study this question, we trained two monkeys to discriminate whether two elongated bars are either separate, thus generating two different figures, or connected, thus generating a single figure. Using voltage-sensitive dyes, we imaged at high spatial and temporal resolution V1 population responses evoked by the two bars, while keeping their local attributes similar among the two conditions. In the separate condition, unlike the connected condition, the population response to one bar is enhanced, whereas the response to the other is simultaneously suppressed. The response to the background remained unchanged between the two conditions. This divergent pattern developed ∼200 ms poststimulus onset and could discriminate well between the separate and connected single trials. The stimulus separation saliency and behavioral report were highly correlated with the differential response to the bars. In addition, the proximity and/or the specific location of the connectors seemed to have only a weak effect on this late activity pattern, further supporting the involvement of top-down influences. Additional neural codes were less informative about the separate and connected conditions, with much less consistency and discriminability compared with a response amplitude code. We suggest that V1 is involved in the encoding of each figure by different neuronal response amplitude, which can mediate their segregation and perception.},

abstract = {In a typical visual scene we continuously perceive a “figure” that is segregated from the surrounding “background” despite ongoing microsaccades and small saccades that are performed when attempting fixation (fixational saccades [FSs]). Previously reported neuronal correlates of figure-ground (FG) segregation in the primary visual cortex (V1) showed enhanced activity in the “figure” along with suppressed activity in the noisy “background.” However, it is unknown how this FG modulation in V1 is affected by FSs. To investigate this question, we trained two monkeys to detect a contour embedded in a noisy background while simultaneously imaging V1 using voltage-sensitive dyes. During stimulus presentation, the monkeys typically performed 1-3 FSs, which displaced the contour over the retina. Using eye position and a 2D analytical model to map the stimulus onto V1, we were able to compute FG modulation before and after each FS. On the spatial cortical scale, we found that, after each FS, FG modulation follows the stimulus retinal displacement and “hops” within the V1 retinotopic map, suggesting visual instability. On the temporal scale, FG modulation is initiated in the new retinotopic position before it disappeared from the old retinotopic position. Moreover, the FG modulation developed faster after an FS, compared with after stimulus onset, which may contribute to visual stability of FG segregation, along the timeline of stimulus presentation. Therefore, despite spatial discontinuity of FG modulation in V1, the higher-order stability of FG modulation along time may enable our stable and continuous perception.},

Thus, activity in down stream areas should reflect lower-level inputs. Here we qualify this notion reporting case LG, a rare case of developmental object agnosia and prosopagnosia. In this person, V1 was robustly activated by visual stimuli, yet intermediate areas (V2-V4) were strongly deactivated. Despite this intermediate deactivation, activity in down stream visual areas remained robust, showing selectivity for houses and places, while selectivity for faces and objects was impaired. The extent of impairment evident in functional magnetic resonance imaging and electroencephalography activations was somewhat larger in the left hemisphere. This pattern of brain activity, coupled with fairly adequate everyday visual performance is compatible with models emphasizing the role of nonlinear local “amplification” of neuronal inputs in eliciting activity in ventral and dorsal visual pathways as well as perceptual experience in the human brain. Thus, while the proper functioning of intermediate areas appears essential for specialization in the cortex, daily visual behavior and reading are maintained even with deactivated intermediate visual areas.},

abstract = {Perception of a visual attribute, such as orientation, is strongly dependent on the context within which a feature is presented, such as that seen in the tilt illusion. The possibility that the neurophysiological basis for this phenomenon may be manifest at the level of cells in striate cortex is suggested by anatomical and physiological observations of orientation dependent long range horizontal connections which relate disparate points in the visual field. This study explores the dependency of the functional properties of single cells on visual context. We observed several influences of the visual field area surrounding cells’ receptive field on the properties of the receptive field center: inhibition or facilitation dependent on the orientation of the surround, shifts in orientation preference and changes in the bandwidth of orientation tuning. To relate these changes to perceptual changes in orientation we modeled a neuronal ensemble encoding orientation. Our results show that the filter characteristics of striate cortical cells are not necessarily fixed, but can be dynamic, changing according to context.},

abstract = {The question of whether language affects perception has been debated largely on the basis of cross-language data, without considering the functional organization of the brain. The nature of this neural organization predicts that, if language affects perception, it should do so more in the right visual field than in the left visual field, an idea unexamined in the debate. Here, we find support for this proposal in lateralized color discrimination tasks. Reaction times to targets in the right visual field were faster when the target and distractor colors had different names; in contrast, reaction times to targets in the left visual field were not affected by the names of the target and distractor colors. Moreover, pattern was disrupted when participants performed a secondary task that engaged verbal working memory but not a task making comparable demands on spatial working memory. It appears that people view the right (but not the left) half of their visual world through the lens of their native language, providing an unexpected resolution to the language-and-thought debate.},

year = {1990}, 
abstract = {The findings presented in these studies have brought out different ideas concerning the mechanisms of processing in primary visual cortex than were held at the outset. Rather than thinking of receptive fields as being restricted in their extent, with the process of integration of the components of an image occurring at a much later stage along the visual pathway, we have shown that the integrative process is a progressive one, beginning in the primary visual cortex (or perhaps even earlier) and building up in a cascading series of converging and diverging connections. Rather than thinking of the filter characteristics of a cell as being fixed, it is apparent that they are dynamic and can be modified by the context in which features are presented. Finally, rather than a cortex with a functional architecture that is fixed after a critical period ending in infancy, we find that perturbing the system can lead to long-term topographical reorganization. Other examples of contextual interactions have been demonstrated in the submodalities of motion, where a cell’s directional selectivity is modulated by the presence of movement in the surround (Allman et al. 1985; Tanaka et al. 1986; Gulyas et al. 1987; Orban et al. 1987). In the domain of color, the phenomenon of color constancy, reported for cells in visual area V4 (Zeki 1983), also requires lateral interactions in visual space, comparing the wavelength distribution of light coming from surfaces in different parts of the visual field. The influences presented in these studies, as in our own work in the domain of orientation, are modulatory. The long-term changes in cortical topography following removal of somatosensory input (Merzenich et al. 1984, 1988) or by retinal lesions suggest that with the appropriate manipulations the lateral interactions can be enhanced to the point of activating the postsynaptic cells. Although retinal lesions clearly represent an abnormal disruption of sensory input, they may nevertheless be representative of long-term reorganizations of neural networks occurring under normal circumstances, such as those required for memory.},

To address this issue, we compared properties of layer 3 pyramidal neurons in 2 cortical areas that span a broad range of cortical function—primary sensory (V1), to cognitive (frontal)—in the mouse and the rhesus monkey. Hierarchical clustering and discriminant analyses of 15 physiological and 25 morphological variables revealed 2 fundamental principles. First, V1 and frontal neurons are remarkably similar with regard to nearly every property in the mouse, while the opposite is true in the monkey, with V1 and frontal neurons exhibiting significant differences in nearly every property assessed. Second, neurons within visual and frontal areas differ significantly between the mouse and the monkey. Neurons in mouse and monkey V1 are the same size, but differ in nearly every other way; mouse frontal cortical neurons are smaller than those in the monkey and also differ substantially with regard to most other properties. These findings have broad implications for understanding the differential contributions of heterogeneous neuronal types in construction of cortical microcircuitry in diverse brain areas and species.},

We measured performance in an orientation-estimation task and found that orientation judgments were more accurate at cardinal (horizontal and vertical) orientations. Judgments made under conditions of uncertainty were strongly biased toward cardinal orientations. We estimated observers’ internal models for orientation and found that they matched the local orientation distribution measured in photographs.

Previous evidence shows that the human visual system accounts for the distance the observer has walked and the separation of the eyes when judging the scale, shape, and distance of objects. However, in an immersive virtual-reality environment, observers failed to notice when a scene expanded or contracted, despite having consistent information about scale from both distance walked and binocular vision. This failure led to large errors in judging the size of objects. The pattern of errors cannot be explained by assuming a visual reconstruction of the scene with an incorrect estimate of interocular separation or distance walked. Instead, it is consistent with a Bayesian model of cue integration in which the efficacy of motion and disparity cues is greater at near viewing distances. Our results imply that observers are more willing to adjust their estimate of interocular separation or distance walked than to accept that the scene has changed in size.},

Using polytrode recording in rat visual cortex, we found that nucleus basalis stimulation caused prominent decorrelation between neurons and marked improvement in the reliability of neuronal responses to natural scenes. The decorrelation depended on local activation of cortical muscarinic acetylcholine receptors, whereas the increased reliability involved distributed neural circuits, as evidenced by nucleus basalis‚Äìinduced changes in thalamic responses. Further analysis showed that the decorrelation and increased reliability improved cortical representation of natural stimuli in a complementary manner. Thus, the basal forebrain neuromodulatory circuit, which is known to be activated during aroused and attentive states, acts through both local and distributed mechanisms to improve sensory coding},

We address this theoretical ability by developing a model system that captures features of experimentally recorded simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons. We use the Line Source Approximation method (Holt and Koch 1999) to model the extracellular action potential (EAP) voltage resulting from the spiking activity of individual neurons. We compare the simultaneous intracellular and extracellular recordings of CA1 pyramidal neurons recorded in vivo (Henze et al. 2000) with model predictions for the same cells reconstructed and simulated with compartmental models. The model accurately reproduces both the waveform and the amplitude of the EAP’s, although it was difficult to achieve simultaneous good matches on both the intracellular and extracellular waveforms. This suggests that accounting for the EAP waveform provides a considerable constraint on the overall model. The developed model explains how and why the waveform varies with electrode position relative to the recorded cell. Interestingly, each cell’s dendritic morphology had very little impact on the EAP waveform. The model also demonstrates that the varied composition of ionic currents in different cells is reflected in the features of the EAP.},

Information theoretic methods are increasingly recognized as significant tools for the analysis of spike train data. However, developing robust implementations of these methods can be time-consuming, and determining applicability to neural recordings can require expertise. In order to facilitate more widespread adoption of these informative methods by the neuroscience community, we have developed the Spike Train Analysis Toolkit. STAToolkit is a software package which implements, documents, and guides application of several information-theoretic spike train analysis techniques, thus minimizing the effort needed to adopt and use them. This implementation behaves like a typical Matlab toolbox, but the underlying computations are coded in C for portability, optimized for efficiency, and interfaced with Matlab via the MEX framework. STAToolkit runs on any of three major platforms: Windows, Mac OS, and Linux. The toolkit reads input from files with an easy-to-generate text-based, platform-independent format. STAToolkit, including full documentation and test cases, is freely available open source via http://neuroanalysis.org, maintained as a resource for the computational neuroscience and neuroinformatics communities. Use cases drawn from somatosensory and gustatory neurophysiology, and community use of STAToolkit, demonstrate its utility and scope.},

Previous neuroimaging research, especially involving knowledge biased to visual and functional information, suggests that semantic representations depend on modality-specific brain mechanisms. However, it is unclear whether sensory cortical regions, in general, support retrieval of perceptual knowledge. Using neuroimaging methods, we show that semantic decisions that index tactile, gustatory, auditory, and visual knowledge specifically activate brain regions associated with encoding these sensory experiences. Retrieval of tactile knowledge was specifically associated with increased activation in somatosensory, motor, and premotor cortical regions. In contrast, decisions involving flavor knowledge increased activation in an orbitofrontal region previously implicated in processing semantic comparisons among edible items. Perceptual knowledge retrieval that references visual and auditory experiences was associated with increased activity in distinct temporal brain regions involved in the respective sensory processing. These results indicate that retrieval of perceptual knowledge relies on brain regions used to mediate sensory experiences with the referenced objects.},

abstract = {Ganglion cells in the vertebrate retina integrate visual information over their receptive fields. They do so by pooling presynaptic excitatory inputs from typically many bipolar cells, which themselves collect inputs from several photoreceptors. In addition, inhibitory interactions mediated by horizontal cells and amacrine cells modulate the structure of the receptive field. In many models, this spatial integration is assumed to occur in a linear fashion. Yet, it has long been known that spatial integration by retinal ganglion cells also incurs nonlinear phenomena. Moreover, several recent examples have shown that nonlinear spatial integration is tightly connected to specific visual functions performed by different types of retinal ganglion cells. This work discusses these advances in understanding the role of nonlinear spatial integration and reviews recent efforts to quantitatively study the nature and mechanisms underlying spatial nonlinearities. These new insights point towards a critical role of nonlinearities within ganglion cell receptive fields for capturing responses of the cells to natural and behaviorally relevant visual stimuli. In the long run, nonlinear phenomena of spatial integration may also prove important for implementing the actual neural code of retinal neurons when designing visual prostheses for the eye.},

volume = {},

pages = {}, 
year = {2016}, 
abstract = {A central assertion in the study of neural processing is that our perception of the environment directly reflects the activity of our sensory neurons. This assertion reinforces the intuition that the strength of a sensory input directly modulates the amount of neural activity observed in response to that sensory feature - an increase in the strength of the input yields a graded increase in the amount of neural activity. However, cortical activity across a range of sensory pathways can be sparse, with individual neurons having remarkably low firing rates, often exhibiting suprathreshold activity on only a fraction of experimental trials. To compensate for this observed apparent unreliability, it is assumed that instead the local population of neurons, though not explicitly measured, does reliably represent the strength of the sensory input. This assumption, however, is largely untested. Here, using wide-field voltage-sensitive dye imaging of the somatosensory cortex in the anesthetized rat, we show that whisker deflection velocity, or stimulus strength, is not encoded by the magnitude of the population response at the level of cortex. Instead, modulation of whisker deflection velocity affects the likelihood of the cortical response, impacting the magnitude, rate of change, and spatial extent of the cortical response. An ideal observer analysis of the cortical response points to a probabilistic code based on repeated sampling across cortical columns and/or time, which we refer to as the probability of activation hypothesis. This hypothesis motivates a range of testable predictions for both future electrophysiological and future behavioral studies.},

However, some portion of the variability arises from fluctuations in excitability due to factors that are not purely sensory, such as arousal, attention and adaptation. To isolate these fluctuations, we developed a model in which spikes are generated by a Poisson process whose rate is the product of a drive that is sensory in origin and a gain summarizing stimulus-independent modulatory influences on excitability. This model provides an accurate account of response distributions of visual neurons in macaque lateral geniculate nucleus and cortical areas V1, V2 and MT, revealing that variability originates in large part from excitability fluctuations that are correlated over time and between neurons, and that increase in strength along the visual pathway. The model provides a parsimonious explanation for observed systematic dependencies of response variability and covariability on firing rate.},

Conduction velocities of two types of on-centre monkey ganglion cells, called phasic and tonic, have been measured by stimulating their axons in the optic tract while recording from their cell bodies in the retina.2. The average conduction velocity of twenty-two phasic and twenty-seven tonic cells is 3.8+/-S.D. 0.6 and 1.8+/-S.D. 0.4 m/sec respectively. Since the latter, but not the former, show opponent-colour responses, retinal signals carrying information about colour appear to be travelling in smaller axons than those not handling such information.3. Stimulation of the optic tract elicits several graded intraretinal potentials, which are negative in the optic nerve fibre layer and positive in the inner plexiform layer. One of these potentials, which is largest near the fovea, occurs simultaneously with the antidromic impulses of tonic ganglion cells and is considered to result from extracellular current generated by these cells.4. Stimulation of the optic tract suppresses the orthodromic responses of ganglion cells, more for phasic than for tonic ones. This suppression is only observed after a cell is antidromically driven and is considered most likely due to a transient hyperpolarization of the cell’s membrane potential following an impulse.},

abstract = {Thalamic interneurons and thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) neurons provide inhibitory innervation of thalamocortical cells that significantly influence thalamic gating. The local interneurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) give rise to two distinct synaptic outputs: classical axonal and dendrodendritic. Activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs) by agonists or optic tract stimulation increases the output of these presynaptic dendrites leading to increased inhibition of thalamocortical neurons. The present study was aimed to evaluate the actions of specific mGluRs on inhibitory GABA-mediated signaling. We found that the group I mGluR (mGluR(1,5)) agonist (RS)-3,5-dihydroxyphenylglycine (DHPG) or optic tract stimulation produced a robust increase in spontaneous IPSCs (sIPSCs) in thalamocortical neurons that was attenuated by the selective mGluR(5) antagonist 2-methyl-6-(phenylethynyl)pyridine hydrochloride (MPEP). In contrast, the group II mGluR (mGluR(2,3)) agonists (2R, 4R)-4-aminopyrrolidine-2,4-dicarboxylate (APDC) or (2S,2’R,3’R)-2-(2’3’-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine (DCG-IV) suppressed the frequency of sIPSCs. In addition, mGluR(1,5) agonist DHPG produced depolarizations and mGluR(2/3) agonists APDC or L-CCG-I [(2S,1’S,2’S)-2-(carboxycyclopropyl)glycine] produced hyperpolarizations in dLGN interneurons. Furthermore, the enhanced sIPSC activity by optic tract stimulation was reduced when paired with corticothalamic fiber stimulation. The present data indicate that activation of specific mGluR subtypes differentially regulates inhibitory activity via different synaptic pathways. Our results suggest that activation of specific mGluR subtypes can upregulate or downregulate inhibitory activity in thalamic relay neurons, and these actions likely shape excitatory synaptic integration and thus regulate information transfer through thalamocortical circuits.},

Neurons within dLGN express different mGluR subtypes associated with distinct afferent synaptic pathways; however, the physiological function of this organization is unclear. We report that the activation of mGluR(5), which are located on presynaptic dendrites of local interneurons, increases GABA output that in turn produces an increased inhibitory activity on proximal but not distal dendrites of dLGN thalamocortical neurons. In contrast, mGluR(1) activation produces strong membrane depolarization in thalamocortical neurons regardless of distal or proximal dendritic locations. These findings provide physiological evidence that mGluR(1) appear to be distributed along the thalamocortical neuron dendrites, whereas mGluR(5)-dependent action occurs on the proximal dendrites/soma of thalamocortical neurons. The differential distribution and activation of mGluR subtypes on interneurons and thalamocortical neurons may serve to shape excitatory synaptic integration and thereby regulate information gating through the thalamus.},

abstract = {Visual recognition is achieved by a hierarchy of bidirectionally connected cortical areas. The entry of signals into higher areas involves the serial sampling of information within a movable window of attention. Here we explore how the cortex can move this window and integrate the sampled information. To make this concrete, we modeled the process of visual word recognition by hierarchical cortical areas representing features, letters, and words. At the start of the recognition process, nodes representing all contextually possible words are active. Simple connectivity rules allow a parallel top-down (T-D) computation of the relative probability of each feature at each location given the set of active words. This information is then used to guide the window of attention to information-rich features (e.g., a feature that is present in the visual image but has lowest probability). Bottom-up processing of this feature excludes words that do not contain it and leads to T-D recomputation of feature probabilities. Recognition occurs after several such cycles when all but one word has been excluded. We show that when 950 words are stored in long-term memory, recognition occurs after an average of 4.9 cycles. Because covert attention can be moved every 20-30 ms, word recognition could be as fast as determined experimentally (<200 ms of cortical processing). This model accounts for the findings that recognition time depends logarithmically on set size, recognition time is reduced when context reduces the number of possible targets, the time to classify a nonword decreases when its approximation to English decreases, and in high level cortex, the firing of neurons tuned to an object increases progressively as its recognition occurs. More generally the model provides a physiologically plausible view of how bi-directional signal flow in cortex guides attention to produce efficient recognition},

abstract = {The effect of various wave lengths of visible light in the stimulation of single visual sense cells has been studied by means of the single fiber preparation from the eye of Limulus. Oscillographic records were made of the impulse discharge in a single optic nerve fiber in response to stimulation of the attached sense cell by lights of different wave lengths. Wratten monochromatic filters supplied the means for obtaining the different spectral lights; the total intensity supplied to the eye being determined by a thermopile and galvanometer. With lights of approximately equal energy content the strongest response occurs to the green region of the spectrum. The response, however, does not vary qualitatively with wave length. By the proper adjustment of intensity, responses can be obtained which are identical, impulse for impulse, for all the spectral lights used. Moreover the ratios of the intensities for the various wave lengths necessary to produce a constant response do not vary with the intensity level of the stimulating lights; there is no Purkinje effect. The single visual sense cell can gauge brightness but cannot distinguish wave length. The reciprocals of the intensities necessary to produce a constant response when plotted against wave length give the visibility curve for the single sense cell. This curve is symmetrical about a maximum at lambda520mmicro, falling off to low values in the red and violet. It closely resembles the visibility curve for human rod vision. Bundles from the optic nerve containing several active fibers whose impulses can be distinguished by differences in form and magnitude or whose attached sense cells can be located and illuminated independently were used to determine whether there is any differential sensitivity among sense cells in the same eye for different regions of the spectrum. Such a differential sensitivity has been found to exist in the eye of Limulus and may be considered a peripheral mechanism of color vision.},

Layer V neurons project exclusively to higher-order thalamic nuclei, while layer VIa fibers project to both first-order and higher-order thalamic nuclei. During early postnatal development, layer VIa and VIb fibers accumulate at the borders of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) before they innervate it. After neonatal monocular enucleation or silencing of the early retinal activity, there is premature entry of layer VIa and VIb fibers into the dLGN contralateral to the manipulation. Layer V fibers do not innervate the superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus during the first postnatal week, but also demonstrate premature entry to the contralateral superficial gray layer following neonatal enucleation. Normally, layer V driver projections to the thalamus only innervate higher-order nuclei. Our results demonstrate that removal of retinal input from the dLGN induces cortical layer V projections to aberrantly enter, arborize, and synapse within the first-order dLGN. These results suggest that there is cross-hierarchical corticothalamic plasticity after monocular enucleation. Cross-hierarchical rewiring has been previously demonstrated in the thalamocortical system (Pouchelon et al. 2014), and now we provide evidence for cross-hierarchical corticothalamic rewiring after loss of the peripheral sensory input.},

Modern researchers sometimes attribute it to Galen, but Galen was clear in his contention that the mental faculties were located in the substance of the brain rather than in the ventricles. It was only later scholars who, using Galen’s anatomy as their basis, placed the mental faculties in the ventricles themselves. The system came together piece by piece over a period of centuries, probably not appearing fully in the form known to the Medieval world until the Middle Ages themselves.

abstract = {Crowding is the breakdown in object recognition that occurs in cluttered visual environments [1-4] and the fundamental limit on peripheral vision, affecting identification within many visual modalities [5-9] and across large spatial regions [10]. Though frequently characterized as a disruptive process through which object representations are suppressed [11, 12] or lost altogether [13-15], we demonstrate that crowding systematically changes the appearance of objects. In particular, target patches of visual noise that are surrounded (”crowded”) by oriented Gabor flankers become perceptually oriented, matching the flankers. This was established with a change-detection paradigm: under crowded conditions, target changes from noise to Gabor went unnoticed when the Gabor orientation matched the flankers (and the illusory target percept), despite being easily detected when they differed. Rotation of the flankers (leaving target noise unaltered) also induced illusory target rotations. Blank targets led to similar results, demonstrating that crowding can induce apparent structure where none exists. Finally, adaptation to these stimuli induced a tilt aftereffect at the target location, consistent with signals from the flankers “spreading” across space. These results confirm predictions from change-based models of crowding, such as averaging [16], and establish crowding as a regularization process that simplifies the peripheral field by promoting consistent appearance among adjacent objects.},

To understand perception, the signal codes and the stored knowledge or assumptions used for deriving perceptual hypotheses must be discovered. Systematic perceptual errors are important clues for appreciating signal channel limitations, and for discovering hypothesis-generating procedures. Although this distinction between ‘physiological’ and ‘cognitive’ aspects of perception may be logically clear, it is in practice surprisingly difficult to establish which are responsible even for clearly established phenomena such as the classical distortion illusions. Experimental results are presented, aimed at distinguishing between and disconvering what happens when there is mismatch with the neural signal channel, and when neural signals are processed inappropriately for the current situation. This leads us to make some distinctions between perceptual and scientific hypotheses, which raise in a new form the problem: What are ‘objects’?},

abstract = {The classic spatial summation curve seen in cat dLGN cells involves a response that increases with increasing diameter up to a point that delivers an “optimal” response and then decreases as the diameter is further increased. The latter reflects what is often referred to as a “surround suppressive” mechanism but in fact the totality of the spatial summation behavior is classically modeled by overlapping excitatory and inhibitory gaussians in the “DOG” model (Rodieck, 1965). In reality the situation is complex with the basic receptive field center-surround characteristics set up by retinal mechanisms, but modified by the pattern of convergence of retinal afferents on LGN relay cells, inhibitory mechanism flowing from local intrinsic inhibitory interneurons, reflected inhibition from interneurons in the TRN and cortical feedback providing direct facilitatory modulatory input to relay cells and indirect modulation of inhibitory effects mediated via intrinsic inteneurons and TRN cells (Sillito & Kemp, 1983; Sillito et al, 2006; Wang et al, 2006). The role of burst versus tonic firing in the LGN and the type of visual information that may be relayed by these different firing patterns has been extensively examined elsewhere (Alitto et al, 2005; Rivadulla et al, 2003; Sherman, 2001). Here we have examined the spatial summation curves of cat dLGN cells as assessed solely from the burst and tonic spikes within their responses to drifting gratings.
Across our sample as a whole (n=48) the optimal diameter assessed from the burst firing of the cells was 1.26° (±0.13 SE) whilst that from the tonic firing was 0.91° (±0.05 SE). These two means are significantly different (P < 0.01, Wilcoxon paired rank test). The patch suppression index (PSI = [1 − (Rplat ÷ Ropt)×100]) was also different with that for the summation curve for burst spikes being 59.5% (±4.35 SE) and for tonic spikes 77.4% (±2.85 SE). Again these were significantly different (P < 0.001, Wilcoxon paired rank test). There appeared to be no difference between the data from X and Y cells; both showed the same pattern of effects. The smaller optimal diameter and stronger surround suppression of the tonic firing means it provides a spatially precise signal to the cortex whilst the burst input provides less precision but may gain more rapid access to the cortical mechanism (Sherman, 2001). The balance in the prevalence of these two mechanisms in the firing pattern may be strongly influenced by the level of corticofugal feedback and the pattern of visual stimulation in the behaving animal.},

Behavioral evidence suggests, however, that some scene information is extracted even when attention is directed elsewhere. Here, we investigated the neural correlates of this ability by examining how attention affects electrophysiological markers of scene perception. In two electro-encephalography (EEG) experiments, human subjects categorized real-world scenes as manmade or natural (full attention condition) or performed tasks on unrelated stimuli in the center or periphery of the scenes (reduced attention conditions). Scene processing was examined in two ways: traditional trial averaging was used to assess the presence of a categorical manmade/natural distinction in event-related potentials, whereas single-trial analyses assessed whether EEG activity was modulated by scene statistics that are diagnostic of naturalness of individual scenes. The results indicated that evoked activity up to 250 ms was unaffected by reduced attention, showing intact categorical differences between manmade and natural scenes and strong modulations of single-trial activity by scene statistics in all conditions. Thus initial processing of both categorical and individual scene information remained intact with reduced attention. Importantly, however, attention did have profound effects on later evoked activity; full attention on the scene resulted in prolonged manmade/natural differences, increased neural sensitivity to scene statistics, and enhanced scene memory. These results show that initial processing of real-world scene information is intact with diminished attention but that the depth of processing of this information does depend on attention.},

abstract = {Charles G. Gross is an experimental neuroscientist who specializes in brain mechanisms in vision. He is also fascinated by the history of his field. In these tales describing the growth of knowledge about the brain from the early Egyptians and Greeks to the present time, he attempts to answer the question of how the discipline of neuroscience evolved into its modern incarnation through the twists and turns of history.
The first essay tells the story of the visual cortex, from the first written mention of the brain by the Egyptians, to the philosophical and physiological studies by the Greeks, to the Dark Ages and the Renaissance, and finally, to the modern work of Hubel and Wiesel. The second essay focuses on Leonardo da Vinci’s beautiful anatomical work on the brain and the eye: was Leonardo drawing the body observed, the body remembered, the body read about, or his own dissections? The third essay derives from the question of whether there can be a solely theoretical biology or biologist; it highlights the work of Emanuel Swedenborg, the eighteenth-century Swedish mystic who was two hundred years ahead of his time. The fourth essay entails a mystery: how did the largely ignored brain structure called the “hippocampus minor” come to be, and why was it so important in the controversies that swirled about Darwin’s theories? The final essay describes the discovery of the visual functions of the temporal and parietal lobes. The author traces both developments to nineteenth-century observations of the effect of temporal and parietal lesions in monkeys -- observations that were forgotten and subsequently rediscovered.
Review
Brain lovers are in for a rare treat: here’s a brain book that is filled with historical treasures and is a pure pleasure to read besides. An eminent neuroscientist, the author also turns out to be a master sleuth of forgotten facts as well as a thoroughly entertaining teller of tales.
(Mortimer Mishkin, Laboratory of Neuropsychology, National Institute of Mental Health)
Gross’s tales of the history of neuroscience can be warmly recommended to all students of the brain, but especially to those who believe that history began when they were undergraduates. Informative and amusing in equal part, Gross is as fair to those who were wildly wrong as to those who were (relatively) right. Never less than fascinating.
(John C. Marshall Nature)

abstract = {The FACADE model, and its laminar cortical realization and extension in the 3D LAMINART model, have explained, simulated, and predicted many perceptual and neurobiological data about how the visual cortex carries out 3D vision and figure-ground perception, and how these cortical mechanisms enable 2D pictures to generate 3D percepts of occluding and occluded objects. In particular, these models have proposed how border ownership occurs, but have not yet explicitly explained the correlation between multiple properties of border ownership neurons in cortical area V2 that were reported in a remarkable series of neurophysiological experiments by von der Heydt and his colleagues; namely, border ownership, contrast preference, binocular stereoscopic information, selectivity for side-of-figure, Gestalt rules, and strength of attentional modulation, as well as the time course during which such properties arise. This article shows how, by combining 3D LAMINART properties that were discovered in two parallel streams of research, a unified explanation of these properties emerges. This explanation proposes, moreover, how these properties contribute to the generation of consciously seen 3D surfaces. The first research stream models how processes like 3D boundary grouping and surface filling-in interact in multiple stages within and between the V1 interblob-V2 interstripe-V4 cortical stream and the V1 blob-V2 thin stripe-V4 cortical stream, respectively. Of particular importance for understanding figure-ground separation is how these cortical interactions convert computationally complementary boundary and surface mechanisms into a consistent conscious percept, including the critical use of surface contour feedback signals from surface representations in V2 thin stripes to boundary representations in V2 interstripes. Remarkably, key figure-ground properties emerge from these feedback interactions. The second research stream shows how cells that compute absolute disparity in cortical area V1 are transformed into cells that compute relative disparity in cortical area V2. Relative disparity is a more invariant measure of an object’s depth and 3D shape, and is sensitive to figure-ground properties.},

Approximately 45% of the contacts in these laminae are formed by axons tentatively identifiable as corticogeniculate fibers; about 35% by presumed intrageniculate fibers. Close to one half of the synapses occur in „encapsulated synaptic zones,“ where grapelike dendritic appendages are related mainly to intrageniculate and retinogeniculate axons, and about half lie in “interstitial zones,“ where corticogeniculate and some intrageniculate axons contact distal dendritic segments.
Regions of the nucleus receiving from peripheral parts of the retina have relatively more corticogeniculate synapses, and have fewer intrageniculate synapses in the encapsulated zones than do regions receiving from the central parts of the retina.
Most of the tissue in lamina B resembles the interstitial zones of laminae A and A1 and over 2/3 of the contacts in lamina B may prove to be corticogeniculate. The retinogeniculate fibers in this lamina are associated with relatively few other axons in simple, small encapsulated zones.

They send one branch to the thalamus and the other to motor centers of the brainstem or spinal cord. Because the thalamic branches necessarily carry copies of the motor instructions their messages have the properties of efference copies. That is, they can be regarded as providing reliable information about impending instructions contributing to movements that will produce changes in inputs to receptors, thus allowing neural centers to compensate for these changes of input. We consider how a sensory pathway like the medial lemniscus, the spinothalamic tract or the optic tract can also be seen to act as a pathway for an efference copy. The direct connections that ascending and cortical inputs to the thalamus also establish to motor outputs create sensorimotor relationships that provide cortex with a model of activity in lower circuits and link the sensory and the motor sides of behavior more tightly than can be expected from motor outputs with a single, central origin. These transthalamic connectional patterns differ from classical models of separate neural pathways for carrying efference copies of actions generated at higher levels, and introduce some different functional possibilities.},

In standard conditions the background was a two-dimensional (2D) noise pattern, the bar moved at optimal speed, and its contrast level was adjusted to yield 50% of the maximum response. Neuronal responses to the moving bar were suppressed when the background moved at the same speed or faster than the bar. The direction of motion of the bar had little influence. This suppressive effect was equally strong in all three experimental samples. The suppressive effect of the moving background was uniformly distributed among the cortical population, being equally strong in all layers, in all parts of the visual field representation, and for different categories of cortical cells. The suppressive effect of the moving background depended little on the structure of the background or on the speed of the bar. The suppression increased with decreasing contrast of the bar. Many (80%) cortical cells and all geniculate neurons responded to the movement of the 2D noise on its own. Most of these cells responded to isolated features (”grains”) in the pattern rather than to movement of the whole pattern. There was no difference in strength of suppression between cortical neurons responsive and unresponsive to the moving 2D noise. The possible origins of this suppressive influence of moving backgrounds and its significance for the processing of visual scenes, more complicated than a single stimulus, are discussed.},

abstract = {1. The influence of a moving texture on neuronal responses to a moving bar was tested in 103 area 18 neurons of anesthetized and paralyzed cats. The texture was a two-dimensional noise pattern, the bar moved at optimal speed, and its contrast was adjusted to yield 50% of the maximum response. 2. The moving texture exerted two different but related effects: it suppressed the response of area 18 neurons to the moving bar, and it modulated the direction selectivity of parastriate neurons. These effects were strongest when the texture moved at the same speed or faster than the bar. 3. Genuine suppressive effects of the moving texture were distinguished from lack of summation between bar and texture responses. Suppressive effects of either type were observed in 75% of the area 18 cells and occurred more frequently among C family cells, velocity tuned cells, and in layer 5 than in other groups of cells. 4. The modulation of direction selectivity was distinguished from pseudomodulation because of lack of summation of bar and texture responses. The direction selectivity of 35% of the area 18 cells was modulated by the moving texture. Six different relative direction selectivity (RDS) types were observed in area 18. 5. The neurons of which direction selectivity was modulated by the moving texture occurred predominantly in layers 2-3 and 6, suggesting that they represent a further stage of processing within area 18. 6. Many (75%) area 18 cells responded to the texture moving on its own. Most of these cells respond to isolated features (”grains”) in the patterns rather than to the movement of the whole pattern. Cells responding to the movement of the whole pattern were generally C family cells, and their direction selectivity was not modulated by the moving texture. 7. These results are compared with those obtained under identical experimental conditions in area 17. Although suppressive effects are similar in both areas, RDS types are differently distributed in the two areas. 8. The possible origins of the interactions and their functional significance are discussed.},

abstract = {We compared responses of neurons, recorded in striate cortex (area V1) of awake, fixating monkeys, to a single drifting grating with those to a ‘plaid’ pattern comprised of two superimposed drifting gratings separated in orientation by 90 degrees. Five out of 54 (9%) of V1 direction selective neurons responded to the direction of motion of the whole pattern [pattern motion (PM) selectivity]. Tuning curves for plaid stimuli were similar in both optimum direction and width of tuning to those for single gratings. Twenty nine out of 54 (54%) responded simply to the motion of individual orientated gratings within the pattern [component motion (CM) selectivity]. The remaining 37% (20/54) neurons were unclassified. In control experiments, 39 direction selective neurons were recorded in area V1 of anaesthetized monkey and cats. Unlike area V1 in behaving monkeys, none of these neurons exhibited PM selectivity to the drifting plaids. Twenty eight out of 39 (72%) of them responded to the direction of the component gratings and were classified as CM selectivity. Our results indicate that although most V1 neurons are CM selective, as described in anaesthetized animals, a subpopulation is clearly PM selective in behaving monkeys, reflecting integration of locally derived motion signals. Neurons in V1 therefore carry signals that may contribute to pattern motion processing and perception. This perceptual interpretation in V1 might depend much more critically on information integration mechanisms that only function properly in awake, perceiving animals},

Here, we provide evidence that implicates these same mechanisms in the retinal disease glaucoma, a major cause of irreversible blindness worldwide, previously associated simply with the effects of intraocular pressure. We show that Abeta colocalizes with apoptotic retinal ganglion cells (RGC) in experimental glaucoma and induces significant RGC apoptosis in vivo in a dose- and time-dependent manner. We demonstrate that targeting different components of the Abeta formation and aggregation pathway can effectively reduce glaucomatous RGC apoptosis in vivo, and finally, that combining treatments (triple therapy) is more effective than monotherapy. Our work suggests that targeting the Abeta pathway provides a therapeutic avenue in glaucoma management. Furthermore, our work demonstrates that the combination of agents affecting multiple stages in the Abeta pathway may be the most effective strategy in Abeta-related diseases.},

Evidence suggests that the visual system may use the spatio-temporal regularities of the external world, available in the retinal signal, to extract information from the visual environment and better reconstruct current and future stimuli. We studied this by recording neuronal responses of primary visual cortex (area V1) in anaesthetized and paralysed macaques during the presentation of dynamic sequences of bars, in which spatio-temporal regularities and local information were independently manipulated. Most V1 neurons were significantly modulated by events prior to and distant from stimulation of their classical receptive fields (CRFs); many were more strongly tuned to prior and distant events than they were to CRFs bars; and several showed tuning to prior information without any CRF stimulation. Hence, V1 neurons do not simply analyse local contours, but impute local features to the visual world, on the basis of prior knowledge of a visual world in which useful information can be distributed widely in space and time.},

Studies of anesthetized animals have indicated that neuronal responses become progressively more variable as information travels from the retina to the cortex. These results have been interpreted to indicate that perception must be based on pooling across relatively large numbers of cells. However, we find that in alert monkeys, responses in primary visual cortex (V1) are as reliable as the inputs from the retina and the thalamus. Moreover, when the effects of fixational eye movements were minimized, response variability (variance/mean - Fano factor, FF) in all V1 layers was low. When presenting optimal stimuli, the median FF was 0.3. High variability, FF approximately 1, was found only near threshold. Our results suggest that in natural vision, suprathreshold perception can be based on small numbers of optimally stimulated cells.},

Direction selective cells in layer 4B have smaller receptive fields than those in layer 6, and layer 4B cells are more selective for orientation. We present evidence for a third direction selective pathway that flows through V1 layers 4Cm (the middle tier of layer 4C) to layer 3. Cells in layer 3 are very selective for orientation, have the smallest receptive fields in V1, and send direct outputs to area V2. Layer 3 neurons are well suited to contribute to detection and recognition of small objects by the ventral cortical stream, as well as to sense subtle motions within objects, such as changes in facial expressions.},

In fact, we found that the illusion is as strong (or stronger) when the retinal expansion is produced on a computer screen without observer self-motion. In a second series of experiments the strength of the Pinna illusion was inferred from the amount of physical counter-rotation required to null it. The strength of the illusion is relatively unaffected by changes to the global structure of the display but minor changes to the micropatterns comprised in the display can effectively eliminate the illusion. We provide a simple model of optical flow that is in very good agreement with many of the results reported.},

Although the computational advantages of spike timing–based neuronal codes have long been recognized, it is unclear whether, and if so how, neurons can learn to read out such representations. We propose a new, biologically plausible supervised synaptic learning rule that enables neurons to efficiently learn a broad range of decision rules, even when information is embedded in the spatiotemporal structure of spike patterns rather than in mean firing rates. The number of categorizations of random spatiotemporal patterns that a neuron can implement is several times larger than the number of its synapses. The underlying nonlinear temporal computation allows neurons to access information beyond single-neuron statistics and to discriminate between inputs on the basis of multineuronal spike statistics. Our work demonstrates the high capacity of neural systems to learn to decode information embedded in distributed patterns of spike synchrony.},

abstract = {Neurons in sensory systems can represent information not only by their firing rate, but also by the precise timing of individual spikes. For example, certain retinal ganglion cells, first identified in the salamander, encode the spatial structure of a new image by their first-spike latencies. Here we explore how this temporal code can be used by downstream neural circuits for computing complex features of the image that are not available from the signals of individual ganglion cells. To this end, we feed the experimentally observed spike trains from a population of retinal ganglion cells to an integrate-and-fire model of post-synaptic integration. The synaptic weights of this integration are tuned according to the recently introduced tempotron learning rule. We find that this model neuron can perform complex visual detection tasks in a single synaptic stage that would require multiple stages for neurons operating instead on neural spike counts. Furthermore, the model computes rapidly, using only a single spike per afferent, and can signal its decision in turn by just a single spike. Extending these analyses to large ensembles of simulated retinal signals, we show that the model can detect the orientation of a visual pattern independent of its phase, an operation thought to be one of the primitives in early visual processing. We analyze how these computations work and compare the performance of this model to other schemes for reading out spike-timing information. These results demonstrate that the retina formats spatial information into temporal spike sequences in a way that favors computation in the time domain. Moreover, complex image analysis can be achieved already by a simple integrate-and-fire model neuron, emphasizing the power and plausibility of rapid neural computing with spike times.},

abstract = {Neuronal firing is determined largely by incoming barrages of excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs), each of which produce a transient increase in firing probability. To measure the effects of weak transient inputs on firing probability of cortical neurons, we compute phase-response curves (PRCs). PRCs, whose shape can be related to the dynamics of spike generation, document the changes in timing of spikes caused by an EPSP in a repetitively firing neuron as a function of when it arrives in the interspike interval (ISI). The PRC can be exactly related to the poststimulus time histogram (PSTH) so that knowledge of one uniquely determines the other. Typically, PRCs have zero values at the start and end of the ISI, where EPSPs have minimal effects and a peak in the middle. Where the peak occurs depends in part on the firing properties of neurons. The PRC can have regions of positivity and negativity corresponding respectively to speeding up and slowing down the time of the next spike. A simple canonical model for spike generation is introduced that shows how both the background firing rate and the degree of postspike afterhyperpolarization contribute to the shape of the PRC and thus to the PSTH. PRCs in strongly adapting neurons are highly skewed to the right (indicating a higher change in probability when the EPSPs appear late in the ISI) and can have negative regions (indicating a decrease in firing probability) early in the ISI. The PRC becomes more skewed to the right as the firing rate decreases. Thus at low firing rates, the spikes are triggered preferentially by inputs that occur only during a small time interval late in the ISI. This implies that the neuron is more of a coincidence detector at low firing frequencies and more of an integrator at high frequencies. The steady-state theory is shown to also hold for slowly varying inputs.},

abstract = {Microsaccades are small saccades. Neurophysiologically, microsaccades are generated using similar brainstem mechanisms as larger saccades. This suggests that peri-saccadic changes in vision that accompany large saccades might also be expected to accompany microsaccades. In this review, we highlight recent evidence demonstrating this. Microsaccades are not only associated with suppressed visual sensitivity and perception, as in the phenomenon of saccadic suppression, but they are also associated with distorted spatial representations, as in the phenomenon of saccadic compression, and pre-movement response gain enhancement, as in the phenomenon of pre-saccadic attention. Surprisingly, the impacts of peri-microsaccadic changes in vision are far reaching, both in time relative to movement onset as well as spatial extent relative to movement size. Periods of ~100 ms before and ~100 ms after microsaccades exhibit significant changes in neuronal activity and behavior, and this happens at eccentricities much larger than the eccentricities targeted by the microsaccades themselves. Because microsaccades occur during experiments enforcing fixation, these effects create a need to consider the impacts of microsaccades when interpreting a variety of experiments on vision, perception, and cognition using awake, behaving subjects. The clearest example of this idea to date has been on the links between microsaccades and covert visual attention. Recent results have demonstrated that peri-microsaccadic changes in vision play a significant role in both neuronal and behavioral signatures of covert visual attention, so much so that in at least some attentional cueing paradigms, there is very tight synchrony between microsaccades and the emergence of attentional effects. Just like large saccades, microsaccades are genuine motor outputs, and their impacts can be substantial even during perceptual and cognitive experiments not concerned with overt motor generation per se.},

abstract = {Spontaneous activity within local circuits affects the integrative properties of neurons and networks. We have previously shown that neocortical network activity exhibits a balance between excitatory and inhibitory synaptic potentials, and such activity has significant effects on synaptic transmission, action potential generation, and spike timing. However, whether such activity facilitates or reduces sensory responses has yet to be clearly determined. We examined this hypothesis in the primary visual cortex in vivo during slow oscillations in ketamine-xylazine anesthetized cats. We measured network activity (Up states) with extracellular recording, while simultaneously recording postsynaptic potentials (PSPs) and action potentials in nearby cells. Stimulating the receptive field revealed that spiking responses of both simple and complex cells were significantly enhanced (>2-fold) during network activity, as were spiking responses to intracellular injection of varying amplitude artificial conductance stimuli. Visually evoked PSPs were not significantly different in amplitude during network activity or quiescence; instead, spontaneous depolarization caused by network activity brought these evoked PSPs closer to firing threshold. Further examination revealed that visual responsiveness was gradually enhanced by progressive membrane potential depolarization. These spontaneous depolarizations enhanced responsiveness to stimuli of varying contrasts, resulting in an upward (multiplicative) scaling of the contrast response function. Our results suggest that small increases in ongoing balanced network activity that result in depolarization may provide a rapid and generalized mechanism to control the responsiveness (gain) of cortical neurons, such as occurs during shifts in spatial attention.},

The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is hypothesized to regulate thalamo-cortical interactions, but the underlying functional architecture of this process and its state dependence are unknown. By combining the first TRN ensemble recording with psychophysics and connectivity-based optogenetic tagging, we found reticular circuits to be composed of distinct subnetworks. While activity of limbic-projecting TRN neurons positively correlates with arousal, sensory-projecting neurons participate in spindles and show elevated synchrony by slow waves during sleep. Sensory-projecting neurons are suppressed by attentional states, demonstrating that their gating of thalamo-cortical interactions is matched to behavioral state. Bidirectional manipulation of attentional performance was achieved through subnetwork-specific optogenetic stimulation. Together, our findings provide evidence for differential inhibition of thalamic nuclei across brain states, where the TRN separately controls external sensory and internal limbic processing facilitating normal cognitive function.

The second-order cumulant density (covariance density) is shown to be common to all the indices. Simulation studies were used to investigate the sampling variability of a single index based on the second-order cumulant. The simulations used a paired motoneurone model and a paired regular spiking cortical neurone model. The sampling variability of spike trains generated under identical conditions from the paired motoneurone model varied from 50% to 160% of the estimated value. On theoretical grounds, and on the basis of simulated data a rate dependence is present in all synchronization indices. The application of coherence and pooled coherence estimates to the issue of synchronization indices is considered. This alternative frequency domain approach allows an arbitrary number of spike train pairs to be evaluated for statistically significant differences, and combined into a single population measure. The pooled coherence framework allows pooled time domain measures to be derived, application of this to the simulated data is illustrated. Data from the cortical neurone model is generated over a wide range of firing rates (1-250 spikes/s). The pooled coherence framework correctly characterizes the sampling variability as not significant over this wide operating range. The broader applicability of this approach to multielectrode array data is briefly discussed.},

abstract = {Although receptive fields of relay cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the cat nearly match those of their retinal afferents, only 10-20% of the synapses on these cells derive from the retina and are excitatory. Many more (30-40%) are inhibitory and largely control the gating of retinogeniculate transmission. These inhibitory synapses derive chiefly from two cell types: intrinsic local circuit neurones and cells in the adjacent perigeniculate nucleus. It has been difficult to study the functional organization of these inhibitory pathways; most efforts have relied on indirect approaches. Here we describe the use of direct techniques to study a local circuit neurone by iontophoresing horseradish peroxidase (HRP) into it, which completely labels the soma and processes of cells for subsequent light- and electron microscopic analysis. Although the response properties of the labelled cell are virtually indistinguishable from those of many relay cells, its morphology is typical of ‘class 3’ neurones (see Fig. 1 legend), which are widely believed to be interneurones (but see ref. 12). Here, we refer to the cell as a ‘local circuit neurone’, which allows for the possibility of a projection axon, rather than as an ‘interneurone’, a term that commonly excludes a projection axon. We find that the labelled cell has a myelinated axon, but that the axon loses its myelin within 50 microns of the soma and has not yet been traced further. The dendrites of the labelled cell possess presynaptic terminals that act as intrinsic sources of inhibition on geniculate relay cells. We also characterize other morphological aspects of this inhibitory circuitry.},

The continued quest to crack the neural codes in the monkey brain would be greatly enhanced with new tools and technologies that can rapidly and reversibly control the activities of desired cells at precise times during specific behavioral states. Recent advances in adapting optogenetic technologies to monkeys have enabled precise control of specific cells or brain regions at the millisecond timescale, allowing for the investigation of the causal role of these neural circuits in this model system. Validation of optogenetic technologies in monkeys also represents a critical preclinical step on the translational path of new generation cell-type-specific neural modulation therapies. Here, I discuss the current state of the application of optogenetics in the nonhuman primate model system, highlighting the available genetic, optical and electrical technologies, and their limitations and potentials.},

abstract = {Technologies for silencing the electrical activity of genetically targeted neurons in the brain are important for assessing the contribution of specific cell types and pathways toward behaviors and pathologies. Recently we found that archaerhodopsin-3 from Halorubrum sodomense (Arch), a light-driven outward proton pump, when genetically expressed in neurons, enables them to be powerfully, transiently, and repeatedly silenced in response to pulses of light. Because of the impressive characteristics of Arch, we explored the optogenetic utility of opsins with high sequence homology to Arch, from archaea of the Halorubrum genus. We found that the archaerhodopsin from Halorubrum strain TP009, which we named ArchT, could mediate photocurrents of similar maximum amplitude to those of Arch (approximately 900 pA in vitro), but with a >3-fold improvement in light sensitivity over Arch, most notably in the optogenetic range of 1-10 mW/mm(2), equating to >2x increase in brain tissue volume addressed by a typical single optical fiber. Upon expression in mouse or rhesus macaque cortical neurons, ArchT expressed well on neuronal membranes, including excellent trafficking for long distances down neuronal axons. The high light sensitivity prompted us to explore ArchT use in the cortex of the rhesus macaque. Optical perturbation of ArchT-expressing neurons in the brain of an awake rhesus macaque resulted in a rapid and complete (approximately 100%) silencing of most recorded cells, with suppressed cells achieving a median firing rate of 0 spikes/s upon illumination. A small population of neurons showed increased firing rates at long latencies following the onset of light stimulation, suggesting the existence of a mechanism of network-level neural activity balancing. The powerful net suppression of activity suggests that ArchT silencing technology might be of great use not only in the causal analysis of neural circuits, but may have therapeutic applications.},

Energetic constraints are used to design silicon-based computers but are poorly understood for neural computation. In the brain, most energy is used to reverse ion influxes generating excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) and action potentials. Thus, EPSCs should be small to minimize energy use, but not so small as to impair information transmission. We quantified information flow through the retinothalamic synapse in the visual pathway in brain slices, with cortical and inhibitory input to the postsynaptic cell blocked. Altering EPSC size with dynamic clamp, we found that a larger-than-normal EPSC increased information flow through the synapse. Thus, the evolutionarily selected EPSC size does not maximize retinal information flow to the cortex. By assessing the energy used on postsynaptic ion pumping and action potentials, we show that, instead, the EPSC size optimizes the ratio of retinal information transmitted to energy consumed. These data suggest maximization of information transmission per energy used as a synaptic design principle.},

We used a sparse stimulus array such that each element could not fall within the same classical receptive field of primary visual cortex neurons (i.e. precluding lateral interactions within V1). This enabled us to attribute differences, in striate cortex responses, to extra-classical receptive field effects mediated by backward connections. In accord with theoretical predictions we were able to demonstrate suppression of striate cortex activations to coherent relative to incoherent motion. These results suggest that suppression of primary visual cortex responses to coherent motion reflect extra-classical effects mediated by backward connections.},

abstract = {Neurons in the functioning cortex fire erratically, with highly variable intervals between spikes. How much irregularity comes from the process of postsynaptic integration and how much from fluctuations in synaptic input? We have addressed these questions by recording the firing of neurons in slices of rat visual cortex in which synaptic receptors are blocked pharmacologically, while injecting controlled trains of unitary conductance transients, to electrically mimic natural synaptic input. Stimulation with a Poisson train of fast excitatory (AMPA-type) conductance transients, to simulate independent inputs, produced much less variability than encountered in vivo. Addition of NMDA-type conductance to each unitary event regularized the firing but lowered the precision and reliability of spikes in repeated responses. Independent Poisson trains of GABA-type conductance transients (reversing at the resting potential), which simulated independent activity in a population of presynaptic inhibitory neurons, failed to increase timing variability substantially but increased the precision of responses. However, introduction of synchrony, or correlations, in the excitatory input, according to a nonstationary Poisson model, dramatically raised timing variability to in vivo levels. The NMDA phase of compound AMPA-NMDA events conferred a time-dependent postsynaptic variability, whereby the reliability and precision of spikes degraded rapidly over the 100 msec after the start of a synchronous input burst. We conclude that postsynaptic mechanisms add significant variability to cortical responses but that substantial synchrony of inputs is necessary to explain in vivo variability. We suggest that NMDA receptors help to implement a switch from precise firing to random firing during responses to concerted inputs Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

abstract = {1. The negative phototropism of certain land isopods was investigated over a large range of intensities, especially low ones. The responses were determined quantitatively by measuring the angle through which an animal turned away from a line perpendicular to the rays of light. 2. In the absence of light the undirected movements set up by obscure stimuli were such as to compensate each other statistically, the average path being a movement in the direction in which the animal was headed. 3. Over a large range of intensities (0.0026 m.c. up) the average turning is maximal, about 55 degrees (Oniscus). This maximal response is due to an anatomical peculiarity, in that the carapace cuts off the light on the eye after the animal has turned 50-60 degrees. This peculiarity probably accounts for specific differences among land isopods. Any light, therefore, which is strong enough to turn an animal through this maximal angle in a radial distance of 10 cm. will give results whose mean will be maximal. 4. Below 0.0026 m.c. the amount of angular deflection becomes less and less, in proportion to the logarithm of the intensity, until at 0.00003 m.c. the movements are the same as in darkness. 5. This proportionality between amount of turning and the logarithm of the intensity indicates the photochemical nature of phototropism on the basis of Hecht’s work with Mya. As a result, Loeb’s theory of phototropism may then be stated in the mathematical form See PDF for Equation in which I(1) and I(2) are the two intensities, E(1) and E(2), their respective effects, and R, the muscular action set up by the difference in photochemical effect on the two sides.},

The method of obtaining and recording these action potentials has been described in an earlier paper. 2. By determining the intensity of stimulus necessary to produce an electric response of a given magnitude (as to maximum action potential), at various times during dark adaptation, a quantitative analysis of the process may be made. This analysis is identical with that of Hecht for the dark adaptation of the human eye. 3. The results of this analysis indicate that the process of dark adaptation in the Limulus eye may be represented by a chemical reaction of the second order-the recombination of products of photolysis to renew the depleted supply of photosensitive material. This is in complete accord with Hecht’s conception of the photosensory process, and is in quantitative agreement with the results obtained by other methods, in several different animal forms. 4. The experimental relation between strength of stimulus and magnitude of electric response reduces the assumption originally made by Hecht to account for the data on the human eye to an equivalent form; that the magnitude of electric response, provided it be sufficiently large, is directly proportional to the concentration of the photosensitive material in the sense organ.},

abstract = {The inhibition that is exerted mutually among the receptor units (ommatidia) in the lateral eye of Limulus has been analyzed by recording oscillographically the discharge of nerve impulses in single optic nerve fibers. The discharges from two ommatidia were recorded simultaneously by connecting the bundles containing their optic nerve fibers to separate amplifiers and recording systems. Ommatidia were chosen that were separated by no more than a few millimeters in the eye; they were illuminated independently by separate optical systems. The frequency of the maintained discharge of impulses from each of two ommatidia illuminated steadily is lower when both are illuminated together than when each is illuminated by itself. When only two ommatidia are illuminated, the magnitude of the inhibition of each one depends only on the degree of activity of the other; the activity of each, in turn, is the resultant of the excitation from its respective light stimulus and the inhibition exerted on it by the other. When additional receptors are illuminated in the vicinity of an interacting pair too far from one ommatidium to affect it directly, but near enough to the second to inhibit it, the frequency of discharge of the first increases as it is partially released from the inhibition exerted on it by the second (disinhibition). Disinhibition simulates facilitation; it is an example of indirect effects of interaction taking place over greater distances in the eye than are covered by direct inhibitory interconnections. When only two interacting ommatidia are illuminated, the inhibition exerted on each (decrease of its frequency of discharge) is a linear function of the degree of activity (frequency of discharge) of the other. Below a certain frequency (often different for different receptors) no inhibition is exerted by a receptor. Above this threshold, the rate of increase of inhibition of one receptor with increasing frequency of discharge of the other is constant, and may be at least as high as 0.2 impulse inhibited in one receptor per impulse discharged by the other. For a given pair of interacting receptors, the inhibitory coefficients are not always the same in the two directions of action. The responses to steady illumination of two receptor units that inhibit each other mutually are described quantitatively by two simultaneous linear equations that express concisely all the features discussed above. These equations may be extended and their number supplemented to describe the responses of more than two interacting elements.},

abstract = {The inhibitory influences exerted mutually among the receptor units (ommatidia) of the lateral eye of Limulus are additive. If two groups of receptors are illuminated together the total inhibition they exert on a “test receptor” near them (decrease in the frequency of its nerve impulse discharge in response to light) depends on the combined inhibitory influences exerted by the two groups. If the two groups are widely separated in the eye, their total inhibitory effect on the test receptor equals the sum of the inhibitory effects they each produce separately. If they are close enough together to interact, their effect when acting together is usually less than the sum of their separate effects, since each group inhibits the activity of the other and hence reduces its inhibitory influence. However, the test receptor, or a small group illuminated with it, may interact with the two groups and affect the net inhibitory action. A variety of quantitative effects have been observed for different configurations of three such groups of receptors. The activity of a population of n interacting elements is described by a set of n simultaneous equations, linear in the frequencies of the receptor elements involved. Applied to three interacting receptors or receptor groups equations are derived that account quantitatively for the variety of effects observed in the various experimental configurations of retinal illumination used.},

The ability of an ommatidium to discharge impulses in the axon of its eccentric cell is reduced by illumination of other ommatidia in its neighborhood: the threshold to light is raised, the number of impulses discharged in response to a suprathreshold flash of light is diminished, and the frequency with which impulses are discharged during steady illumination is decreased. Also, the activity that can be elicited under certain conditions when an ommatidium is in darkness can be inhibited similarly. There is no evidence for the spread of excitatory influences in the eye of Limulus. The inhibitory influence exerted upon an ommatidium that is discharging impulses at a steady rate begins, shortly after the onset of the illumination on neighboring ommatidia, with a sudden deep minimum in the frequency of discharge. After partial recovery, the frequency is maintained at a depressed level until the illumination on the neighboring receptors is turned off, following which there is prompt, though not instantaneous recovery to the original frequency. The inhibition is exerted directly upon the sensitive structure within the ommatidium: it has been observed when the impulses were recorded by a microelectrode thrust into an ommatidium, as well as when they were recorded more proximally in single fibers dissected from the optic nerve. Receptor units of the eye often inhibit one another mutually. This has been observed by recording the activity of two optic nerve fibers simultaneously. The mediation of the inhibitory influence appears to depend upon the integrity of nervous interconnections in the plexus: cutting the lateral connections to an ommatidium abolishes the inhibition exerted upon it. The nature of the influence that is mediated by the plexus and the mechanism whereby it exerts its inhibitory action on the receptor units are not known. The depression of the frequency of the discharge of nerve impulses from an ommatidium increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the intensity of illumination on receptors in its vicinity. Inhibition of the discharge from an ommatidium is greater the larger the area of the eye illuminated in its vicinity. However, equal increments of area become less effective as the total area is increased. The response of an ommatidium is most effectively inhibited by the illumination of ommatidia that are close to it; the effectiveness diminishes with increasing distance, but may extend for several millimeters. Illumination of a fixed region of the eye at constant intensity produces a depression of the frequency of discharge of impulses from a nearby ommatidium that is approximately constant, irrespective of the level of excitation of the ommatidium. The inhibitory interaction in the eye of Limulus is an integrative process that is important in determining the patterns of nervous activity in the visual system. It is analogous to the inhibitory component of the interaction that takes place in the vertebrate retina. Inhibitory interaction results in the exaggeration of differences in sensory activity from different regions of the eye illuminated at different intensities, thus enhancing visual contrast.},

We first tested the hypothesis that motion signals are integrated by neurons whose receptive fields (RFs) do not move with the eye but stay fixed in the world. Specifically, we measured the RF properties of neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of macaques (Macaca mulatta) during the slow phase of optokinetic nystagmus. Using a novel method to estimate RF locations for both spikes and local field potentials, we found that the location on the retina that changed spike rates or local field potentials did not change with eye position; RFs moved with the eye. Second, we tested the hypothesis that neurons link information across eye positions by remapping the retinal location of their RFs to future locations. To test this, we compared RF locations during leftward and rightward slow phases of optokinetic nystagmus. We found no evidence for remapping during slow eye movements; the RF location was not affected by eye-movement direction. Together, our results show that RFs of MT neurons and the aggregate activity reflected in local field potentials are yoked to the eye during slow eye movements. This implies that individual MT neurons do not integrate sensory information from a single position in the world across eye movements. Future research will have to determine whether such integration, and the construction of perceptual stability, takes place in the form of a distributed population code in eye-centered visual cortex or is deferred to downstream areas.},

abstract = {1. We studied the degree and source of response variability in different classes of cell in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). The response of single cells to a series of contrasts of a stationary flashing light spot was measured. The variability analyses were based on the mean and SD of the response to a number of repeated stimulus presentations. The relative variability was expressed by the coefficient of variation (Cv; SD/mean). 2. At a given contrast, the Cv for lagged cells was larger than for nonlagged cells. No difference was found between the Cv of X and Y cells. The magnitude of the Cv was about the same as previously found for cells in striate cortex. Accordingly, little variability is added at the cortical level. The Cv decreased with increasing contrast showing that the reliability of response and the signal-to-noise ratio was improved with increasing contrast. 3. For some cells, the retinal input was determined by recording S potentials in addition to action potentials. The Cv of the retinal input was smaller than the Cv of the dLGN cells at a given contrast. Thus in the paralyzed and anesthetized preparation, variability was added at the geniculate relay. 4. The additional variability was related to modulatory input from the brain stem. This was shown by comparing Cv versus contrast curves for the dLGN cells obtained during electrical stimulation of the peribrachial region of the brain stem (PBR) with corresponding curves obtained without PBR stimulation. During PBR stimulation, which presumably mimics the effects of arousal on the dLGN cell, the Cv at a given contrast was reduced toward the value for the retinal input to the cell. Furthermore PBR stimulation increased the signal-to-noise-ratio of the cell to the level of the retinal input. 5. When Cv was plotted against response rather than against contrast, approximately the same function was found for the various dLGN cell classes. This indicated that the variability basically depended on firing rate rather than on stimulus contrast. No difference of Cv was seen between lagged and nonlagged cells at a given level of response. The difference found at a given level of contrast reflected differences in firing rate of the two cell classes. During PBR stimulation, there was no clear difference between the Cvs of the dLGN cell and its retinal input at a given level of response.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The responsiveness of cortical neurons is strongly and rapidly influenced by changes in the level of local network activity. In rodent somatosensory cortex, increases in network activity increase neuronal responsiveness to the intracellular injection of brief conductance stimuli but paradoxically decrease responsiveness to brief whisker deflections. However, whisker stimulation frequently evokes long-lasting changes in the level of local circuit activity. The ability of stimuli to successfully evoke prolonged increases in circuit activity is associated with both an increase in the amount of conductance evoked by a whisker stimulus and an increase in action potential responsiveness to whisker stimulation. In addition, brief whisker stimuli presented during periods of high network activity evoke postsynaptic potentials containing a greater proportion of inhibition, consistent with an increased efficiency in the activation of inhibitory mechanisms during the Up state. In contrast, during prolonged and variable whisker stimulation, increased network activity is associated with an increase in overall responsiveness, dynamic range, output gain, and correlation between action potential response and speed of whisker movement. We conclude that stimulus-evoked or spontaneous alterations in cortical state can influence neuronal responsiveness in a complex manner, resulting in large changes in which, and how, sensory stimuli are represented.},

abstract = {Even in V1, where neurons have well characterized classical receptive fields (CRFs), it has been difficult to deduce which features of natural scenes stimuli they actually respond to. Forward models based upon CRF stimuli have had limited success in predicting the response of V1 neurons to natural scenes. As natural scenes exhibit complex spatial and temporal correlations, this could be due to surround effects that modulate the sensitivity of the CRF. Here, instead of attempting a forward model, we quantify the importance of the natural scenes surround for awake macaque monkeys by modeling it non-parametrically. We also quantify the influence of two forms of trial to trial variability. The first is related to the neuron’s own spike history. The second is related to ongoing mean field population activity reflected by the local field potential (LFP). We find that the surround produces strong temporal modulations in the firing rate that can be both suppressive and facilitative. Further, the LFP is found to induce a precise timing in spikes, which tend to be temporally localized on sharp LFP transients in the gamma frequency range. Using the pseudo R(2) as a measure of model fit, we find that during natural scene viewing the CRF dominates, accounting for 60% of the fit, but that taken collectively the surround, spike history and LFP are almost as important, accounting for 40%. However, overall only a small proportion of V1 spiking statistics could be explained (R(2)∼5%), even when the full stimulus, spike history and LFP were taken into account. This suggests that under natural scene conditions, the dominant influence on V1 neurons is not the stimulus, nor the mean field dynamics of the LFP, but the complex, incoherent dynamics of the network in which neurons are embedded.},

This intersubject correlation was evident not only in primary and secondary visual and auditory areas, but also in association cortices. The results reveal a surprising tendency of individual brains to ‘tick collectively’ during natural vision. Moreover, our results demonstrate that the unitary nature of conscious experience in fact consists of temporally interleaved and highly selective activations in an ensemble of specialized regions, each of which ‘picks-up’ and analyses its own unique subset of stimuli according to its functional specialization. Applying reverse correlation to the movie stimuli provides a powerful methodology for revealing both known and unexpected functional specializations in those cortical areas activated by the movie.},

Recently, spatial patterns of activity in visual cortex have been successfully used to predict feature-specific stimulus representations for both visible and invisible stimuli. However, because these studies examined only the prediction of static and unchanging perceptual states during extended periods of stimulation, it remains unclear whether activity in early visual cortex can also predict the rapidly and spontaneously changing stream of consciousness. Here, we used binocular rivalry to induce frequent spontaneous and stochastic changes in conscious experience without any corresponding changes in sensory stimulation, while measuring brain activity with fMRI. Using information that was present in the multivariate pattern of responses to stimulus features, we could accurately predict, and therefore track, participants’ conscious experience from the fMRI signal alone while it underwent many spontaneous changes. Prediction in primary visual cortex primarily reflected eye-based signals, whereas prediction in higher areas reflected the color of the percept. Furthermore, accurate prediction during binocular rivalry could be established with signals recorded during stable monocular viewing, showing that prediction generalized across viewing conditions and did not require or rely on motor responses. It is therefore possible to predict the dynamically changing time course of subjective experience with only brain activity.},

Using functional MRI, we found that a task requiring the integration of information between two attended but spatially separated stimuli actively modulated the degree of functional integration (in terms of effective connectivity) between their retinotopic representations in visual cortical areas V1, V2, and V4. Spatial attention enhanced long-distance coupling between distinct neuronal populations that represented the attended visual stimuli, even at the earliest stages of cortical processing. In contrast, unattended stimulus representations were decoupled both from attended representations and particularly strongly from each other. Furthermore, enhanced functional integration between cortical representations was associated with enhanced behavioral performance. Attention may thus serve to “bind” together cortical loci at multiple levels of the visual hierarchy that are commonly involved in processing attended stimuli, promoting integration between otherwise functionally isolated cortical loci.},

However, it is currently unclear how early in visual processing the suppression of eye-based signals can occur. Here we use high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in conjunction with a new binocular rivalry stimulus to show that signals recorded from the human lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) exhibit eye-specific suppression during rivalry. Regions of the LGN that show strong eye-preference independently show strongly reduced activity during binocular rivalry when the stimulus presented in their preferred eye is perceptually suppressed. The human LGN is thus the earliest stage of visual processing that reflects eye-specific dominance and suppression.},

year = {2012}, 
abstract = {The idea of a division between a dorsal and a ventral visual stream is one of the most basic principles of visual processing in the brain (Milner and Goodale, 1995). The ventral stream originates in primary visual cortex and extends along the ventral surface into the temporal cortex; the dorsal stream also arises in primary visual cortex, but continues along the dorsal surface into parietal cortex. The ventral stream (or “vision-for-perception” pathway) is believed to mainly subserve recognition and discrimination of visual shapes and objects, whereas the dorsal stream (or “vision-for-action” pathway) has been primarily associated with visually guided reaching and grasping based on the moment-to-moment analysis of the spatial location, shape, and orientation of objects. It has been proposed, however, that the dorsal stream also processes tools as a category, so that manipulable objects would be processed by those brain regions that are important for the execution of actions. However, because dorsal and ventral visual regions are heavily interconnected, it is difficult to tell in healthy subjects whether information is processed along the dorsal stream only, or whether it is fed to parietal cortex via ventral visual regions.

One way to distinguish between these two alternatives has been offered by the use of continuous flash suppression (CFS) in which noise screens or Mondrian masks flashed at 10 Hz to one eye suppress the perception of an image presented to the other eye. It has been suggested that this method selectively disrupts ventral visual processing while leaving dorsal processing intact (Fang and He, 2005). In a series of visual priming experiments using CFS, Almeida and colleagues (2008) found that reaction times to visible tools were shorter when they were preceded by masked tools rather than masked animals. No such priming effect appeared when subjects had to react to pictures of animals. Importantly, this result was limited to CFS: category priming using backward masking (in which the stimulus is followed by the mask, typically on both eyes) demonstrated priming effects for both tools and animals. These results, together with previous neuroimaging findings (Fang and He, 2005), were interpreted as evidence that tools, or manipulable objects, are indeed processed as a category directly along the dorsal stream.

A recent paper in The Journal of Neuroscience by Sakuraba and colleagues (2012) addresses an important question left open by this research: if information is already separated into dorsal and ventral streams in early visual cortex, which deals with basic visual features, how is it possible that the visual system can distinguish between manipulable and nonmanipulable objects? Almeida and colleagues (2008) had noted that all tool stimuli used in their experiments had an elongated principle axis, which may explain part of their results. Sakuraba and colleagues (2012) take this idea one step further and explore the processing of elongated shapes and nonelongated tools in more detail. Their results challenge the view that previous findings were specific to the category of tools and add significant new evidence to the question of what attributes of visually presented tools may be processed (presumably in dorsal stream cortical areas) outside of awareness under CFS.},

In general, V4 cells were broadly tuned for zero-order disparity, and at any given disparity value, about four-fifths of the cells responded significantly above background. The response modulation by flat surfaces oriented in depth was significant for about one-quarter of cells, and the responses of about one-third of the cells were significantly modulated by convex or concave surfaces at various mean disparities. However, we encountered no cells that unambiguously distinguished a given three-dimensional (3-D) shape independent of mean disparity.

The responses of cells within each area were substantially modulated by each shape characteristic tested, with substantial overlap between areas by many response measures. Our analyses revealed many clear and reliable differences between areas in terms of the effectiveness of, and response modulation by, various shape characteristics. Grating stimuli were on average more effective than contour stimuli in V2 and V4, but the difference was more pronounced in V4. As a population, V4 showed greater response modulation by some shape characteristics (including simple shape characteristics) and V2 showed greater response modulation by many others (including complex shape characteristics). Recordings from area V1 demonstrated complex shape selectivity in some cells and relatively modest population differences in comparison with V2. Altogether, the representation of 2-dimensional shape characteristics revealed by this analysis varies substantially among the 3 areas. But surprisingly, the differences revealed by our analyses, individually or collectively, do not parallel the stepwise organization of the anatomical hierarchy. Commonalities of visual shape representation across hierarchical levels may reflect the replication of neural circuits used in generating complex shape representations at multiple spatial scales.},

abstract = {Firing-rate models provide a practical tool for studying signal processing in the early visual system, permitting more thorough mathematical analysis than spike-based models. We show here that essential response properties of relay cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) can be captured by surprisingly simple firing-rate models consisting of a low-pass filter and a nonlinear activation function. The starting point for our analysis are two spiking neuron models based on experimental data: a spike-response model fitted to data from macaque (Carandini et al. J. Vis., 20(14), 1-2011, 2007), and a model with conductance-based synapses and afterhyperpolarizing currents fitted to data from cat (Casti et al. J. Comput. Neurosci., 24(2), 235-252, 2008). We obtained the nonlinear activation function by stimulating the model neurons with stationary stochastic spike trains, while we characterized the linear filter by fitting a low-pass filter to responses to sinusoidally modulated stochastic spike trains. To account for the non-Poisson nature of retinal spike trains, we performed all analyses with spike trains with higher-order gamma statistics in addition to Poissonian spike trains. Interestingly, the properties of the low-pass filter depend only on the average input rate, but not on the modulation depth of sinusoidally modulated input. Thus, the response properties of our model are fully specified by just three parameters (low-frequency gain, cutoff frequency, and delay) for a given mean input rate and input regularity. This simple firing-rate model reproduces the response of spiking neurons to a step in input rate very well for Poissonian as well as for non-Poissonian input. We also found that the cutoff frequencies, and thus the filter time constants, of the rate-based model are unrelated to the membrane time constants of the underlying spiking models, in agreement with similar observations for simpler models.},

It is not clear whether rats even possess the full complement of ganglion cell types found in other mammals. Since such information is important for evaluating rodent models of visual disease and elucidating the function of homologous and heterologous cells in different animals, we recorded from rat ganglion cells in vivo and systematically measured their spatial receptive field (RF) properties using spot, annulus, and grating patterns. Most of the recorded cells bore likeness to cat X and Y cells, exhibiting brisk responses, center-surround RFs, and linear or nonlinear spatial summation. The others resembled various types of mammalian W cell, including local-edge-detector cells, suppressed-by-contrast cells, and an unusual type with an ON-OFF surround. They generally exhibited sluggish responses, larger RFs, and lower responsiveness. The peak responsivity of brisk-nonlinear (Y-type) cells was around twice that of brisk-linear (X-type) cells and several fold that of sluggish cells. The RF size of brisk-linear and brisk-nonlinear cells was indistinguishable, with average center and surround diameters of 5.6 ± 1.3 and 26.4 ± 11.3 deg, respectively. In contrast, the center diameter of recorded sluggish cells averaged 12.8 ± 7.9 deg. The homogeneous RF size of rat brisk cells is unlike that of cat X and Y cells, and its implication regarding the putative roles of these two ganglion cell types in visual signaling is discussed.},

By successively adding more physiological details to a basic corticothalamic model, it is determined which features are responsible for which effects. In particular, with the addition of a thalamic population, several changes occur in the spatiotemporal power spectrum: power increases at resonances of the corticothalamic loop, while the loop acts as a spatiotemporal low-pass filter, and synaptic and dendritic dynamics temporally low-pass filter the activity more generally. Investigation of the effect of altering parameters and gains reveals new parameter regimes where activity that corresponds to hallucinations is induced by both spatially homogeneous and inhomogeneous temporally oscillating modes. This suggests that the thalamus and corticothalamic loops are essential components of a model of oscillating visual hallucinations.},

The source of this spatial nonlinear summation is still under debate. We have designed a realistic biophysical model of the cat retina to test the influence of different retinal cell classes and subcircuits on the linearity of ganglion cell responses. The intraretinal connectivity consists of the fundamental feedforward pathway via bipolar cells, lateral horizontal cell connectivity, and two amacrine circuits. The wiring diagram of X- and Y-cells is identical apart from two aspects: (1) Y-cells have a wider receptive field and (2) they receive input from a nested amacrine circuit consisting of narrow- and wide-field amacrine cells. The model was tested with contrast-reversed gratings. First and second harmonic response components were determined to estimate the degree of nonlinearity. By means of circuit dissection, we found that a high degree of the Y-cell nonlinear behavior arises from the spatial integration of temporal photoreceptor nonlinearities. Furthermore, we found a weaker and less uniform influence of the nested amacrine circuit. Different sources of nonlinearities interact in a multiplicative manner, and the influence of the amacrine circuit is approximately 25% weaker than that of the photoreceptor. The model predicts that significant nonlinearities occur already at the level of horizontal cell responses. Pharmacological inactivation of the amacrine circuit is expected to exert a milder effect in reducing ganglion cell nonlinearity.},

Such uniqueness was seemingly necessary to justify the superior cognitive abilities of humans over larger-brained mammals such as elephants and whales. However, our recent studies using a novel method to determine the cellular composition of the brain of humans and other primates as well as of rodents and insectivores show that, since different cellular scaling rules apply to the brains within these orders, brain size can no longer be considered a proxy for the number of neurons in the brain. These studies also showed that the human brain is not exceptional in its cellular composition, as it was found to contain as many neuronal and non-neuronal cells as would be expected of a primate brain of its size. Additionally, the so-called overdeveloped human cerebral cortex holds only 19% of all brain neurons, a fraction that is similar to that found in other mammals. In what regards absolute numbers of neurons, however, the human brain does have two advantages compared to other mammalian brains: compared to rodents, and probably to whales and elephants as well, it is built according to the very economical, space-saving scaling rules that apply to other primates; and, among economically built primate brains, it is the largest, hence containing the most neurons. These findings argue in favor of a view of cognitive abilities that is centered on absolute numbers of neurons, rather than on body size or encephalization, and call for a re-examination of several concepts related to the exceptionality of the human brain},

abstract = {Gorillas and orangutans are primates at least as large as humans, but their brains amount to about one third of the size of the human brain. This discrepancy has been used as evidence that the human brain is about 3 times larger than it should be for a primate species of its body size. In contrast to the view that the human brain is special in its size, we have suggested that it is the great apes that might have evolved bodies that are unusually large, on the basis of our recent finding that the cellular composition of the human brain matches that expected for a primate brain of its size, making the human brain a linearly scaled-up primate brain in its number of cells. To investigate whether the brain of great apes also conforms to the primate cellular scaling rules identified previously, we determine the numbers of neuronal and other cells that compose the orangutan and gorilla cerebella, use these numbers to calculate the size of the brain and of the cerebral cortex expected for these species, and show that these match the sizes described in the literature. Our results suggest that the brains of great apes also scale linearly in their numbers of neurons like other primate brains, including humans. The conformity of great apes and humans to the linear cellular scaling rules that apply to other primates that diverged earlier in primate evolution indicates that prehistoric Homo species as well as other hominins must have had brains that conformed to the same scaling rules, irrespective of their body size. We then used those scaling rules and published estimated brain volumes for various hominin species to predict the numbers of neurons that composed their brains. We predict that Homo heidelbergensis and Homo neanderthalensis had brains with approximately 80 billion neurons, within the range of variation found in modern Homo sapiens. We propose that while the cellular scaling rules that apply to the primate brain have remained stable in hominin evolution (since they apply to simians, great apes and modern humans alike), the Colobinae and Pongidae lineages favored marked increases in body size rather than brain size from the common ancestor with the Homo lineage, while the Homo lineage seems to have favored a large brain instead of a large body, possibly due to the metabolic limitations to having both.},

The procedure consists of a commercially available microdrive adapted to a commercially available neural data collection system. The critical advantage of this procedure is that, in each cortical area, a configuration of seven microelectrodes spaced 250‚Äì500 Œºm can be inserted transdurally and each can be moved independently in the z axis. For each microelectrode, the data collection system can record the activity of up to five neurons together with the local field potential (LFP). With this procedure, we normally monitor the simultaneous activity of 70‚Äì100 neurons while trained monkeys discriminate the difference in frequency between two vibrotactile stimuli. Approximately 20‚Äì60 of these neurons have response properties previously reported in this task. The neuronal recordings show good signal-to-noise ratio, are remarkably stable along a 1-day session, and allow testing several protocols. Microelectrodes are removed from the brain after a 1-day recording session, but are reinserted again the next day by using the same or different x-y microelectrode array configurations. The fact that microelectrodes can be moved in the z axis during the recording session and that the x-y configuration can be changed from day to day maximizes the probability of studying simultaneous interactions, both local and across distant cortical areas, between neurons associated with the different components of this task.},

These two variables were manipulated in a cueing task while stimulus contrast was varied. We observed a change in behavioral performance consonant with a change in contrast gain for small stimuli paired with spatial uncertainty and a change in response gain for large stimuli presented at one location (no uncertainty) and surrounded by irrelevant flanking distracters. A complementary neuroimaging experiment revealed that observers’ attention fields were wider with than without spatial uncertainty.

In particular, peripheral objects are only coarsely represented, whereas they are represented with high acuity when foveated. To keep track of visual features of objects across eye movements, these changes in spatial resolution have to be taken into account. Here, we develop and test a new framework proposing a visual feature prediction mechanism based on past experience to deal with changes in spatial resolution accompanying saccadic eye movements. In 3 experiments, we first exposed participants to an altered visual stimulation where, unnoticed by participants, 1 object systematically changed visual features during saccades. Experiments 1 and 2 then demonstrate that feature prediction during peripheral object recognition is biased toward previously associated postsaccadic foveal input and that this effect is particularly associated with making saccades. Moreover, Experiment 3 shows that during visual search, feature prediction is biased toward previously associated presaccadic peripheral input. Together, these findings demonstrate that the visual system uses past experience to predict how peripheral objects will look in the fovea, and what foveal search templates should look like in the periphery. As such, they support our framework based on ideomotor theory and shed new light on the mystery of why we are most of the time unaware of acuity limitations in the periphery and of our ability to locate relevant objects in the periphery.

abstract = {In classical models of object recognition, first, basic features (e.g., edges and lines) are analyzed by independent filters that mimic the receptive field profiles of V1 neurons. In a feedforward fashion, the outputs of these filters are fed to filters at the next processing stage, pooling information across several filters from the previous level, and so forth at subsequent processing stages. Low-level processing determines high-level processing. Information lost on lower stages is irretrievably lost. Models of this type have proven to be very successful in many fields of vision, but have failed to explain object recognition in general. Here, we present experiments that, first, show that, similar to demonstrations from the Gestaltists, figural aspects determine low-level processing (as much as the other way around). Second, performance on a single element depends on all the other elements in the visual scene. Small changes in the overall configuration can lead to large changes in performance. Third, grouping of elements is key. Only if we know how elements group across the entire visual field, can we determine performance on individual elements, i.e., challenging the classical stereotypical filtering approach, which is at the very heart of most vision models.},

The results show that the dynamics of contour integration are good when the contrast of the individual elements is modulated in time (10-30 Hz), but are poor when contour linking per se is temporally modulated (1-12 Hz). The dynamics of contour linking is not dependent on the absolute contrast of the linking elements, so long as they are visible, but does vary with the curvature of the contour. For straight contours, temporal resolution is around 6-12 Hz but falls to around 1-2 Hz for curved contours.},

abstract = {We have recently shown that intrinsic fluctuations of ongoing activity during baseline have an impact on perceptual decisions reported for an ambiguous visual stimulus (Hesselmann et al., 2008). To test whether this result generalizes from the visual object domain to other perceptual and neural systems, the current study investigated the effect of ongoing signal fluctuations in motion-sensitive brain regions on the perception of coherent visual motion. We determined motion coherence thresholds individually for each subject using a dynamic random dot display. During functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), brief events of subliminal, supraliminal, and periliminal coherent motion were presented with long and variable interstimulus intervals between them. On each trial, subjects reported whether they had perceived “coherent” or “random” motion, and fMRI signal time courses were analyzed separately as a function of stimulus and percept type. In the right motion-sensitive occipito-temporal cortex (hMT+), coherent percepts of periliminal stimuli yielded a larger stimulus-evoked response than random percepts. Prestimulus baseline activity in this region was also significantly higher in these coherent trials than in random trials. As in our previous study, however, the relation between ongoing and evoked activity was not additive but interacted with perceptual outcome. Our data thus suggest that endogenous fluctuations in baseline activity have a generic effect on subsequent perceptual decisions. Although mainstream analytical techniques used in functional neuroimaging do not capture this nonadditive effect of baseline on evoked response, it is in accord with postulates from theoretical frameworks as, for instance, predictive coding.},

abstract = {Contrast normalization is a process whereby responses of neurons are scaled according to the total amount of contrast in a region of the image nearby the receptive field of a neuron. This process allows neurons to code for informative scene or object attributes in a manner unaffected by changes in illumination. Evidence for normalization is seen in striate and extrastriate cortex from experiments where multiple stimuli are presented with a single receptive field (RF). Neuronal responses in such experiments are smaller than that predicted by linear summation, revealing the presence of normalization. While the presence of normalization is often clear, its mechanism is less so. To study the mechanism of normalization, we measured the interaction between pairs of brief local stimuli (spatial Gabor functions) within the RFs of cells in the middle temporal (MT or V5) area of monkeys and varied both the location and contrast of the stimuli. We found response summed approximately linearly when contrast was low but rapidly became normalized as stimulus contrast increased. The rapid transition to effective normalization at low contrasts suggested cooperativity in the normalization, and a model embodying such a cooperative step provided a good account of our data.},

abstract = {Neurons in the visual cortex code relative changes in illumination (contrast) and adapt their sensitivities to the visual scene by centring the steepest regions of their sigmoidal contrast response functions (CRFs: spike rate as a function of contrast) on the prevailing contrast. The influence of this contrast gain control has not been reported at non-optimal drift-rates. We calculated the Fisher information contained in the CRFs of halothane-anesthetised cats. Fisher information gives a measure of the accuracy of contrast representations based on the ratio of the square of the steepness of the CRF and the spike-rate dependence of the spiking variance. Variance increases with spike-rate, so Fisher information is maximal where the CRF is steep and spike rates are low. Here, we show that the contrast at which the maximal Fisher information (CMFI) occurs for each adapting drift-rate is at a fixed level above the adapting contrast. For adapting contrasts of 0 to 0.32 the relationship between CMFI and adapting contrast is well described by a straight line with a slope close to 1. The intercept of this line on the CMFI-axis is drift-rate dependent however the slope is not. At high drift-rates relative to each cell’s peak the CMFI-offset is higher than for low drift-rates. The results show that the contrast coding strategy in visual cortex maximizes accuracy for contrasts above the prevailing contrast in the environment for all drift-rates. We argue that tuning the system for accuracy at contrasts above the prevailing value is optimal for viewing natural scenes.},

In contrast, recent human brain-imaging studies have revealed the effects of visual and auditory stimuli on SII activity, which suggest multisensory integration in the human SII. To determine whether multisensory responses of the SII also exist in nonhuman primates, we recorded single-unit activity in response to visual and auditory stimuli from the SII and surrounding regions in 8 hemispheres from 6 awake monkeys. Among 1157 recorded neurons, 306 neurons responded to visual stimuli. These visual neurons usually responded to rather complex stimuli, such as stimulation of the peripersonal space (40.5%), observation of human action (29.1%), and moving-object stimulation outside the monkey’s reach (23.9%). We occasionally applied auditory stimuli to visual neurons and found 10 auditory-responsive neurons that exhibited somatosensory responses. The visual neurons were distributed continuously along the lateral sulcus covering the entire SII, along with other somatosensory neurons. These results highlight the need to investigate novel functional roles—other than somesthetic sensory processing—of the SII.},

For an understanding of complex sensory processing, detailed concepts of the corticothalamic interplay need to be established. To study corticogeniculate processing in a model, we draw on various physiological and anatomical data concerning the intrinsic dynamics of geniculate relay neurons, the cortical influence on relay modes, lagged and nonlagged neurons, and the structure of visual cortical receptive fields. In extensive computer simulations, we elaborate the novel hypothesis that the visual cortex controls via feedback the temporal response properties of geniculate relay cells in a way that alters the tuning of cortical cells for speed.},

Here we explore the earliest levels of striate cortical processing: the first stage, where orientation sensitivity emerges, and the second stage, where stimulus selectivity is further refined. The approach is wholecell recording from cat in vivo. Neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus have circular receptive fields whose subregions, center and surround are concentrically arranged and have the reverse sign, on or off. These neurons supply cortical simple cells, whose receptive fields have on and off subregions that are elongated and lie side by side. Feedforward models hold that orientation sensitivity depends on this thalamocortical change in receptive field structure and an arrangement within subregions such that stimuli of the reverse contrast evoke synaptic responses of the opposite polarity-push-pull. Our work provides support for feedforward models and emphasizes that push-pull is key in the geniculostriate pathway, preserved from retina by thalamic relay cells and reiterated, point by point, by cortical simple cells. Also, we help define the cortical push-pull circuit by identifying inhibitory simple cells. Lastly, separate experiments that compare the first and second levels of cortical processing suggest that differences in the synaptic physiology of connections at the two (thalamocortical versus intracortical) stages underlie differential selectivity for properties such as motion},

abstract = {[Major caveat - all their C cells are shown as single zone ‘cos either bright or dark squares “were not effective”. Described as the most common pattern. They don’t mention hand map of these specific cells, and don’t comment of rf organisation of cells that were hand mapped due to lack of response to computer gen stim - so is this a problem w. “sparse noise” stim, or are these genuine single zone “complex according to H & W and no-one else” cells?? Note also that S cell profiles here and elsewhere show difference between responses to bright and dark stimuli (ie they are bound to delete any overlap region).] Receptive field properties vary systematically across the different layers of the cat striate cortex. Understanding how these functional differences emerge requires a precise description of the interlaminar connections and the quality of information that they transmit. This study examines the contribution of the two physiological types of neuron in layer 6, simple and complex, to the cortical microcircuit. The approach was to make whole-cell recordings with dye-filled electrodes in vivo to correlate visual response property with intracortical projection pattern. The two simple cells we stained projected to layer 4, as previously reported (Gilbert and Wiesel, 1979; Martin and Whitteridge, 1984). Six of the eight complex cells that we labeled projected to the superficial layers, a pathway not previously described in the cat. The remaining two cells targeted the infragranular layers. Layer 4 is dominated by simple cells, whereas layers 5 and 2+3 are mainly composed of complex cells (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Gilbert, 1977). Hence, our results indicate that the ascending projections of simple cells in layer 6 target other simple cells. In parallel, the ascending projections of a population of complex cells in layer 6 favor other complex cells. Anatomical experiments in several species (Lund and Boothe,1975; Burkhalter,1989; Usrey and Fitzpatrick, 1996; Wiser and Callaway, 1996) had also demonstrated that layer 6 gives rise to two separate intracortical pathways. Pooling the results of these anatomical studies with our own suggests a common feature of the laminar organization: cells that project to different intracortical targets have distinct functional characteristics},

abstract = {Simple cells in the visual cortex respond to the precise position of oriented contours (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962). This sensitivity reflects the structure of the simple receptive field, which exhibits two sorts of antagonism between on and off inputs. First, simple receptive fields are divided into adjacent on and off subregions; second, within each subregion, stimuli of the reverse contrast evoke responses of the opposite sign: push-pull (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Palmer and Davis, 1981; Jones and Palmer; 1987; Ferster, 1988). We have made whole-cell patch recordings from cat area 17 during visual stimulation to examine the generation and integration of excitation (push) and suppression (pull) in the simple receptive field. The temporal structure of the push reflected the pattern of thalamic inputs, as judged by comparing the intracellular cortical responses to extracellular recordings made in the lateral geniculate nucleus. Two mechanisms have been advanced to account for the pull-withdrawal of thalamic drive and active, intracortical inhibition (Hubel and Wiesel, 1962; Heggelund, 1986; Ferster, 1988). Our results suggest that intracortical inhibition is the dominant, and perhaps sole, mechanism of suppression. The inhibitory influences operated within a wide dynamic range. When inhibition was strong, the membrane conductance could be doubled or tripled. Furthermore, if a stimulus confined to one subregion was enlarged so that it extended into the next, the sign of response often changed from depolarizing to hyperpolarizing. In other instances, the inhibition modulated neuronal output subtly, by elevating spike threshold or altering firing I-ate at a given membrane voltage},

Together, these two inhibitory circuits influence all information transmitted from the retina to the primary visual cortex. By contrast, relay cells make few local connections. This review explores the role of thalamic inhibition from the dual perspectives of feature detection and information theory. For example, we describe how inhibition sharpens tuning for spatial and temporal features of the stimulus and how it might enhance image perception. We also discuss how inhibitory circuits help to reduce redundancy in signals sent downstream and, at the same time, are adapted to maximize the amount of information conveyed to the cortex.},

abstract = {This article explores the notion that the brain is genetically endowed with an innate virtual reality generator that - through experience-dependent plasticity - becomes a generative or predictive model of the world. This model, which is most clearly revealed in rapid eye movement (REM) sleep dreaming, may provide the theater for conscious experience. Functional neuroimaging evidence for brain activations that are time-locked to rapid eye movements (REMs) endorses the view that waking consciousness emerges from REM sleep - and dreaming lays the foundations for waking perception. In this view, the brain is equipped with a virtual model of the world that generates predictions of its sensations. This model is continually updated and entrained by sensory prediction errors in wakefulness to ensure veridical perception, but not in dreaming. In contrast, dreaming plays an essential role in maintaining and enhancing the capacity to model the world by minimizing model complexity and thereby maximizing both statistical and thermodynamic efficiency. This perspective suggests that consciousness corresponds to the embodied process of inference, realized through the generation of virtual realities (in both sleep and wakefulness). In short, our premise or hypothesis is that the waking brain engages with the world to predict the causes of sensations, while in sleep the brain’s generative model is actively refined so that it generates more efficient predictions during waking. We review the evidence in support of this hypothesis - evidence that grounds consciousness in biophysical computations whose neuronal and neurochemical infrastructure has been disclosed by sleep research.},

Thus, our initial conscious percept--vision at a glance--matches a high-level, generalized, categorical scene interpretation, identifying “forest before trees.” For later vision with scrutiny, reverse hierarchy routines focus attention to specific, active, low-level units, incorporating into conscious perception detailed information available there. Reverse Hierarchy Theory dissociates between early explicit perception and implicit low-level vision, explaining a variety of phenomena. Feature search “pop-out” is attributed to high areas, where large receptive fields underlie spread attention detecting categorical differences. Search for conjunctions or fine discriminations depends on reentry to low-level specific receptive fields using serial focused attention, consistent with recently reported primary visual cortex effects.},

The high spatial frequency cut-off of a Y cell’s fundamental response was in this way related to the centre of the cell’s receptive field. 4. The second harmonic response of a Y cell did not cut off at such a low spatial frequency as the fundamental response. This result indicated that the source of the second harmonic was a spatial subunit of the receptive field smaller in spatial extent than the centre. 5. Contrast sensitivity vs. spatial phase for a Y cell was measured under three conditions: a full grating, a grating seen through a centrally located window, a grating partially obscured by a visual shutter. The 2nd/1st harmonic sensitivity ratio went down with the window and up with the shutter. These results implied that the centre of Y cells was linear and also that the nonlinear subunits extended into the receptive field surround. 6. Spatial localization of the nonlinear subunits was determined by means of a spatial dipole stimulus. The nonlinear subunits overlapped the centre and surround of the receptive field and extended beyond both. 7. The nature of the Y cell nonlinearity was found to be rectification, as determined from measurements of the second harmonic response as a function of contrast. 8.

The use of contrast sensitivity versus spatial phase also served to differentiate the two cell types. With an alternating sine grating stimulus X cells had a sinusoidal dependence on spatial phase, while each Y cell’s sensitivity depended in a complicated manner on spatial phase. 6. Sensitivity versus spatial phase for different Fourier components of the neural response also separated the two classes of cells. Significant second harmonic distortion was present in Y cells. The second harmonic component was spatial phase insensitive, and became dominant at high spatial frequencies. 7. The maximum of the 2nd/1st harmonic ratio was taken as an index of nonlinearity. X cells always had a nonlinearity index less than 1 while in Y cells this index always exceeded 1. 8. Response to spots, diffuse light and drifting gratings were compared to the nonlinearity index as a basis for classifying cells.

In pyramidal cell populations, patterns of neuronal correlations were largely stimulus-dependent, indicating that their responses were not strongly dominated by functionally biased recurrent connectivity. By contrast, visual stimulation only weakly modified co-activation patterns of fast-spiking PV cells, consistent with the observation that these broadly tuned interneurons received very dense and strong synaptic input from nearby pyramidal cells with diverse feature selectivities.

Projection neurons were found in all subregions of the middle temporal area (MT) as well as in the medial superior temporal area (MST). Antidromic latencies ranged from 0.9 to 6 ms with a median of 1.8 ms. There was a strong bias in the population of cortical neurons projecting to the NOT-DTN for ipsiversive stimulus movement (towards the recording side), whereas in the population of cortical neurons not projecting to the NOT-DTN a more or less equal distribution of stimulus directions was evident. Our data indicate that there is no special area in the posterior STS coding for ipsiversive horizontal stimulus movement. Instead, a specific selection of cortical neurons from areas MT and MST forms the projection to the NOT-DTN and as a subpopulation has the same directional bias as their subcortical target neurons.

abstract = {A computer simulation of the human preattentive visual pathway used Gabor and difference-of-Gaussian (DOG) filters to model two-dimensional relative phase discrimination. There is a hierarchy of hexagonally packed levels: (i) an image layer; (ii) an intermediate level of on- and off-centre DOG filters; (iii) a partial set of broadband oriented Gabor-like filters with high-level DOG filters in parallel. Connections between layers use half-wave rectification and a compressive nonlinearity. Local feedback interactions between oriented Gabor filters, together with spatial averaging, allow the model to discriminate both two-dimensional relative phase and orientation differences. There were two separate simulations for die Gabor filters, one with even-symmetric filters and another with odd-symmetric. Textures were formed by superposing three high contrast sine-wave gratings with successive rotations of 60°. Relative phase and global orientation were the varied parameters. Psychophysical rating data for peripheral viewing of texture pairs resemble the results from the even-symmetric simulation, showing discrimination of relative phase and orientation. In contrast, the DOG filters in the model simulate only the relative phase aspects of the data.},

When moving dots alternate in color and in motion direction, reports of the perceived color and motion reveal an asynchrony: the most accurate reports occur when the motion change precedes the associated color change by approximately 100ms [Moutoussis, K., & Zeki, S. (1997). A direct demonstration of perceptual asynchrony in vision. Proceedings of the Royal Society of London B, 264, 393-399]. This feature binding asynchrony was probed by manipulating endogenous and exogenous attention. First, endogenous attention was manipulated by changing which feature dimension observers were instructed to attend to first. This yielded little effect on the asynchrony. Second, exogenous attention was manipulated by briefly presenting a ring around the target, cueing the report of the color and motion seen within the ring. This reduced or eliminated the apparent latency difference between color and motion. Accuracy was best predicted by timing of each feature relative to the cue rather than the timing of the two features relative to each other, suggesting independent attentional access to the two features with an exogenous attention cue. The timing of attentional cueing affected feature pairing reports as much as the timing of the features themselves.},

In their recent article supporting the discrete sampling theory, Andrews and Purves [3] highlight a recent finding that IMR occurs most often for stimuli with a particular temporal frequency rather than a particular velocity. In other words, IMR appears to be temporal-frequency tuned. According to Andrews and Purves, this contradicts the theory that the illusion results from spurious responses of Reichardt motion detectors because, they claim, ‘Reichardt motion detectors are tuned to velocity rather than temporal frequency’ (p.263). This last claim, a crucial one for their argument, is erroneous.},

After survival times of 17 hours to 7 days, the thalamus was examined for retrogradely HRP labelled nerve cells in serial transverse sections. From these sections, the percentage of labelled cells occurring in each subdivision of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) was calculated for each animal. One case each for injections in areas 17, 18, and 19 was then chosen for nerve cell size measurements in each LGNd subdivision. The perikaryal area of each labelled cell (N=689), and of representative samples of unlabelled cells (N=1137), was measured by planimetry. Size distribution histograms, mean values, standard deviation, and statistical significance levels were obtained by computer. It was found that area 17 receives a projection almost exclusively from laminae A and Al, and that the projecting cells belong to all cell size classes. Area 18 receives a projection mainly from laminae C and Al, and from the medial interlaminar nucleus (MIN). The projecting cells belong mainly to the large cell size classes. Area 19 receives a projection largely from MIN, and also from the C-laminae and extrageniculate cell groups. The projecting cells belong to all cell size classes, with some emphasis on the large cells of lamina C. A significant projection was found to exist from the parvocellular laminae of LGNd onto area 19 and, to a lesser degree, area 18. In conclusion, as one goes from area 17 and 18 and to 19 the projection source shifts from the A-lamine through the C-laminae on to MIN and extrageniculate cell groups. The cells which project to area 18 are on the whole larger than those which project to areas 17 and 19. A significant proportion of the contralateral visual input to area 18 is relayed via lamina C. These results provide a quantitative confirmation and extension of previous anatomical findings, and are in close relationship with physiological results regarding parallel channel processing in the visual system.},

We provide an overview of recent neuroscientific studies devoted to analyze the neural processes underlying the AB and their temporal dynamics. The available evidence points to an attentional network involving temporal, right-parietal and frontal cortex, and suggests that the components of this neural network interact by means of synchronization and stimulus-induced desynchronization in the beta frequency range. We set up a neurocognitive scenario describing how the AB might emerge and why it depends on the presence of masks and the other event(s) the targets are embedded in. The scenario supports the idea that the AB arises from “biased competition”, with the top-down bias being generated by parietal-frontal interactions and the competition taking place between stimulus codes in temporal cortex.},

We systematically explored the ability of multiple ventral visual areas to support a variety of ‘category-orthogonal’ object properties such as position, size and pose. For complex naturalistic stimuli, we found that the inferior temporal (IT) population encodes all measured category-orthogonal object properties, including those properties often considered to be low-level features (for example, position), more explicitly than earlier ventral stream areas. We also found that the IT population better predicts human performance patterns across properties. A hierarchical neural network model based on simple computational principles generates these same cross-area patterns of information. Taken together, our empirical results support the hypothesis that all behaviorally relevant object properties are extracted in concert up the ventral visual hierarchy, and our computational model explains how that hierarchy might be built.},

To accomplish this, we obtained electrical, magnetic, and hemodynamic measures of attention from human subjects while they detected large-scale or small-scale targets within multiscale stimulus patterns. Subjects did not know the scale of the target before stimulus onset, and yet the neural locus of attention-related activity between 250 and 300 ms varied according to the scale of the target. Specifically, maximal attention-related activity spread from a high-level, relatively anterior visual area (the lateral occipital complex) for large-scale targets to include a lower-level, more posterior area (visual area V4) for small-scale targets. This rapid change indicates that the neural locus of attention in visual cortex is not static but is instead determined rapidly and dynamically by means of an interaction between top-down task information and local information about the current visual input.},

To demonstrate this center-surround profile, we asked subjects to focus attention onto a color pop-out target and then presented probe stimuli at various distances from the target. We observed that the electromagnetic response to the probe was enhanced when the probe was presented at the location of the target, but the probe response was suppressed in a narrow zone surrounding the target and then recovered at more distant locations. Withdrawing attention from the pop-out target by engaging observers in a demanding foveal task eliminated this pattern, confirming a truly attention-driven effect. These results indicate that neural enhancement and suppression coexist in a spatially structured manner that is optimal to attenuate the most deleterious noise during visual object identification.},

One class of neurons thought to play a critical role in motion perception is V1 neurons whose spatiotemporal receptive fields are oriented in space-time. We used the reverse correlation technique to study the relationship between color tuning and space-time receptive field orientation in V1 neurons of awake, fixating monkeys. Neurons with space-time oriented receptive fields were tuned almost exclusively for luminance, whereas neurons with nonoriented space-time receptive fields were tuned for luminance or for color. These results suggest that the special role of luminance contrast in motion perception is due in part to the establishment of space-time oriented receptive fields among luminance-tuned, but not color-tuned, V1 neurons.},

Complex cells were studied by spike-triggered covariance, which identifies features in the stimulus sequence that trigger spikes in neurons with receptive fields containing multiple linear subunits that combine nonlinearly. All complex cells responded to nonopponent stimulus modulations. Although some complex cells responded to cone-opponent stimulus modulations too, none exhibited the pure opponent sensitivity observed in many simple cells.

GAD-positive staining of neuronal somata and proximal dendrites is observed in the NR of normal (untreated) rats, and this staining is substantially enhanced following colchicine injection into the lateral cerebral ventricle. GAD-positive neuronal cell bodies are prominent throughout the dorsoventral and rostrocaudal extents of the NR and, thus, form a band around the entire lateral aspect of the thalamus. In the lateral part of the NR, oval-shaped neurons with elongated GAD-positive dendritic processes are oriented parallel to the narrow axis of the NR and lie perpendicular to the penetrating fascicles of unstained thalamocortical and corticothalamic fibers. Semithin (2 micrometers) sections confirm that GAD-positive reaction product is contain within the cytoplasm of cell bodies and proximal dendrites. In addition, GAD-positive punctate structures, representing axon terminals, are present in the neuropil and, occasionally, are observed in close proximity to positively-stained neuronal somata. This finding suggests that GABA-mediated inhibition of GABA neurons may occur in the NR. The large number of GAD-positive cell bodies within the NR contrasts with a paucity of positively-stained somata in the more internally located thalamic nuclei. Within these nuclei, GAD-positive punctate structures that represent GABAergic synaptic sites are a characteristic feature. Since previous anatomical studies have demonstrated that a large proportion or reticularis neurons project into the thalamus, it is suggested that many of these GAD-positive punctate structures are the axon terminals of reticularis neurons. Through these projections, reticularis neurons may contribute to GABA-mediated inhibition within many of the thalamic nuclei.},

Repetitive stimulation of synaptic inputs at frequencies around 10 Hz produced postsynaptic potentials that grew in size and carried an increasing number of action potentials resulting from the depression of inhibitory synaptic currents. Frequency selectivity was obtained through the relatively weak depression of inhibitory synapses at low frequencies, and strong depression of excitatory synapses together with activation of a calcium-activated potassium current at high frequencies. This network resonance is a consequence of short-term synaptic plasticity in a network of neurones without intrinsic resonances. These results suggest that short-term plasticity of cortical synapses could shape the dynamics of synchronized oscillations in the brain.},

abstract = {Early retinotopic cortex has traditionally been viewed as containing a veridical representation of the low-level properties of the image, not imbued by high-level interpretation and meaning. Yet several recent results indicate that neural representations in early retinotopic cortex reflect not just the sensory properties of the image, but also the perceived size and brightness of image regions. Here we used functional magnetic resonance imaging pattern analyses to ask whether the representation of an object in early retinotopic cortex changes when the object is recognized compared with when the same stimulus is presented but not recognized. Our data confirmed this hypothesis: the pattern of response in early retinotopic visual cortex to a two-tone “Mooney” image of an object was more similar to the response to the full grayscale photo version of the same image when observers knew what the two-tone image represented than when they did not. Further, in a second experiment, high-level interpretations actually overrode bottom-up stimulus information, such that the pattern of response in early retinotopic cortex to an identified two-tone image was more similar to the response to the photographic version of that stimulus than it was to the response to the identical two-tone image when it was not identified. Our findings are consistent with prior results indicating that perceived size and brightness affect representations in early retinotopic visual cortex and, further, show that even higher-level information--knowledge of object identity--also affects the representation of an object in early retinotopic cortex.},

abstract = {In natural behavioral situations, saccadic eye movements not only introduce new stimuli into V1 receptive fields, they also cause changes in the background. We recorded in awake macaque V1 using a fixation paradigm and compared evoked activity to small stimuli when the background was either static or changing as with a saccade. When a stimulus was shown on a static background, as in most previous experiments, the initial response was orientation selective and contrast was inversely correlated with response latency. When a stimulus was introduced with a background change, V1 neurons showed a qualitatively different temporal response pattern in which information about stimulus orientation and contrast was delayed. The delay in the representation of visual information was found with three different types of background change-luminance increment, luminance decrement, and a pattern change with fixed mean luminance. We also found that with a background change, V1 off responses were suppressed and had a shorter time course compared with the static-background situation. Our results suggest that the distribution of temporal changes across the visual field plays a fundamental role in determining V1 responses. In the static-background condition, temporal change in the visual input occurs only in a small portion of the visual field. In the changing-background condition, and presumably in natural vision, temporal changes are widely distributed. Thus a delayed representation of visual information may be more representative of natural visual situations.},

Surface interiors appear to “fill-in.” Psychophysical experiments also show that surface perception involves a slow scale-dependent process distinct from mechanisms involved in contour perception. The present experiments aimed to test the hypothesis that surface perception is associated with relatively slow scale-dependent neural filling-in. We found that responses in macaque primary visual cortex (V1) are slower to surface interiors than responses to optimal bar stimuli. Moreover, we found that the response to a surface interior is delayed relative to the response to the surface’s border and the extent of the delay is proportional to the distance between a receptive field and the border. These findings are consistent with some forms of neural filling-in and suggest that V1 may provide the neural substrate for perceptual filling-in.},

By transmitting only the unpredicted portions of an incoming sensory signal, predictive coding allows the nervous system to reduce redundancy and make full use of the limited dynamic range of neurons. Starting with the hypothesis of efficient coding as a design principle in the sensory system, predictive coding provides a functional explanation for a range of neural responses and many aspects of brain organization. The lateral and temporal antagonism in receptive fields in the retina and lateral geniculate nucleus occur naturally as a consequence of predictive coding of natural images. In the higher visual system, predictive coding provides an explanation for oriented receptive fields and contextual effects as well as the hierarchical reciprocally connected organization of the cortex. Predictive coding has also been found to be consistent with a variety of neurophysiological and psychophysical data obtained from different areas of the brain.

This recently developed technology has evolved rapidly and generated considerable excitement in neuroscience research. This technology successfully solves the severe problem of achieving both high temporal and spatial precision within intact neural tissues of animals that electrical stimulation and pharmacological methods cannot achieve. It allows neurons to express light-sensitive genes that enable the identification, dissection, and manipulation of specific neural populations and their connections in the tissues and organs of awake animals with unprecedented spatial and temporal precision. Light-sensitive genes chiefly including the genetically targeted light-gated channels channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) and halorhodopsin (NpHR) cause intracellular ion flow during optical illumination. Subsequently, the neurons undergo a series of changes resulting from membrane depolarization or hyperpolarization. To date, there are many published research articles and reviews that describe this new technology; however, few of the reports concern its application to neuropsychiatric diseases. In this review, we summarize the most recent optogenetic research in these diseases, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), epilepsy, schizophrenia, anxiety, fear, reward behaviors, and sleep disorders. We propose that novel optogenetics technology creates excellent opportunities for innovative treatment strategies of neuropsychiatric diseases.},

abstract = {In natural visual situations, unlike most psychophysical experiments, when a new stimulus appears in a portion of the visual field, the surrounding background changes simultaneously. In recordings from macaque V1, we found that a visual stimulus presented simultaneously with a background change evokes a response that is qualitatively different from the response to the same stimulus flashed on a static background. With the changing background, information about stimulus orientation and contrast is significantly delayed compared with the static-background situation. Our physiological results make several predictions that we test in the present paper with human psychophysical experiments. In a backward masking paradigm, a bar stimulus was either flashed onto a static background or presented simultaneously with a change in background luminance or pattern. Subjects discriminated bar orientation or detected that the scene changed before the mask. To achieve an equivalent contrast threshold for orientation discrimination, a longer stimulus-mask onset asynchrony (SOA) was needed in the changing than in the static-background condition; to match the orientation discrimination performance in the static and changing-background conditions at a fixed SOA, a higher bar contrast was needed when the background changed. Moreover, in the changing-background condition, a longer SOA was needed to discriminate bar orientation than to detect the scene change. These results suggest that orientation information is available more slowly when the background changes; orientation information is available earlier as stimulus contrast increases. The psychophysical findings are consistent with our physiological predictions. Compared with the common technique of flashing stimuli onto a static background, the changing-background paradigm may be more similar to natural vision in which saccades bring new stimuli and backgrounds into the visual field.},

Integration overcomes motion ambiguity in the visual image by spatial pooling of motion signals, whereas segmentation identifies differences between adjacent moving objects. For visual motion area MT, previous investigations have reported that stimuli in the receptive field surround, which do not elicit a response when presented alone, can nevertheless modulate responses to stimuli in the receptive field center. The directional tuning of this “surround modulation” has been found to be mainly antagonistic and hence consistent with segmentation. Here, we report that surround modulation in area MT can be either antagonistic or integrative depending upon the visual stimulus. Both types of modulation were delayed relative to response onset. Our results suggest that the dominance of antagonistic modulation in previous MT studies was due to stimulus choice and that segmentation and integration are achieved, in part, via adaptive surround modulation.},

abstract = {The perceptual interpretation of a given visual feature depends on the surrounding context. To explore the neural mechanisms underlying such contextual interactions in the motion domain, we studied responses of neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of macaque monkeys while presenting a variety of center-surround stimuli that stimulated both the classical receptive visual field (CRF) and the receptive field surround. In human psychophysical experiments, the perceptual impact of the surround stimulus on the center stimulus varied from motion capture (”integration”) to motion contrast (”segmentation”). In our neurophysiological experiments, the directional tuning of surround modulation with these stimuli ranged from antagonistic (consistent with motion contrast) to integrative (consistent with motion capture) and agreed qualitatively with perception under some but not all conditions. Most strikingly, for a stimulus that elicited perceptual motion contrast, surround modulation was integrative if the CRF stimulus was ambiguous due to the aperture problem. In addition, we found that surround modulation was linked to response magnitude: stimuli eliciting the largest responses yielded the strongest antagonism and those eliciting the smallest responses yielded the strongest integration. We developed a neural network model that accounts for this finding as well as a previous finding that surround suppression in area MT is contrast-dependent. Our findings suggest that changes in MT surround modulation result from shifts in the balance between directionally tuned excitation and inhibition mediated by changes in input strength. We speculate that input strength is, in turn, linked with the ambiguity of the motion present within the CRF.},

Each population of neurons is described by a multivariate probability density function that satisfies a conservation equation with appropriately defined probability fluxes and boundary conditions. The state variables of each neuron are the membrane potential and the inactivation gating variable of the low-threshold Ca2+ current I(T). The synaptic coupling of the populations and external excitatory drive are modeled by instantaneous jumps in the membrane potential of postsynaptic neurons. The population density model is validated by comparing its response to time-varying retinal input to Monte Carlo simulations of the corresponding IFB network composed of 100 to 1,000 cells per population. In the absence of retinal input, the population density model exhibits rhythmic bursting similar to the 7 to 14 Hz oscillations associated with slow wave sleep that require feedback inhibition from RE to TC cells. When the TC and RE cell potassium leakage conductances are adjusted to represent cholingergic neuromodulation and arousal of the network, rhythmic bursting of the probability density model may either persists or be eliminated depending on the number of excitatory (TC to RE) or inhibitory (RE to TC) connections made by each presynaptic cell. When the probability density model is stimulated with constant retinal input (10-100 spikes/sec), a wide range of responses are observed depending on cellular parameters and network connectivity. These include asynchronous burst and tonic spikes, sleep spindle-like rhythmic bursting, and oscillations in population firing rate that are distinguishable from sleep spindles due to their amplitude, frequency, or the presence of tonic spikes. In this context of dLGN/PGN network modeling, we find the population density approach using 2,500 mesh points and resolving membrane voltage to 0.7 mV is over 30 times more efficient than 1,000-cell Monte Carlo simulations.},

abstract = {1. Voltage-gated K currents were studied in relay neurons (RNs) acutely isolated from somatosensory (VB) thalamus of 7- to 14-day-old rats. In addition to a rapidly activated, transient outward current, IA, depolarizations activated slower K+ currents, which were isolated through the use of appropriate ionic and pharmacological conditions and measured via whole-cell voltage-clamp. 2. At least two slow components of outward current were observed, both of which were sensitive to changes in [K+]o, as expected for K conductances. The first, IK1, had an amplitude that was insensitive to holding potential and a relatively small conductance of 150 pS/pF. It was blocked by submillimolar levels of tetraethylammonium [TEA, 50%-inhibitory concentration (IC50 = 30 microM)] and 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 40 microM). In the absence of intracellular Ca2+ buffering, the amplitude of IK1 was both larger and dependent on holding potential, as expected for a Ca(2+)-dependent current. Replacement of [Ca2+]o by Co2+ reduced IK1, although the addition of Cd2+ to Ca(2+)-containing solutions had no effect. 3. The second component, IK2, had a normalized conductance of 2.0 nS/pF and was blocked by millimolar concentrations of TEA (IC50 = 4 mM) but not by 4AP. The kinetics of IK2 were analogous to (but much slower than) those of IA in that both currents displayed voltage-dependent activation and voltage-independent inactivation. IK2 was not reduced by the addition of Cd2+ to Ca(2+)-containing solutions or by replacement of Ca2+ by Co2+. 4. IK2 had a more depolarized activation threshold than IA and attained peak amplitude with a latency of approximately 100 ms at room temperature. IK2 decay was nonexponential and could be described as the sum of two components with time constants (tau) near 1 and 10 s. 5. IK2 was one-half steady-state inactivated at a membrane potential of -63 mV, near the normal resting potential for these cells. The slope factor of the Boltzman function describing steady-state inactivation was 13 mV-1, which indicates that IK2 varies in availability across a broad voltage range between -100 and -20 mV. 6. Activation kinetics of IK2 were voltage dependent, with peak latency shifting from 300 to 50 ms in the voltage range -50 to +30 mV. Deinactivation and deactivation were also voltage dependent, in contrast to inactivation, which showed little dependence on membrane potential. Increase in temperature sped the kinetics of IK2, with temperature coefficient (Q10) values near 3 for activation and inactivation. Heating increased the amplitude of IK2 with a Q10 value near 2.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The inhibitory GABAergic projection of thalamic nucleus reticularis (nRt) neurons onto thalamocortical relay cells (TCs) is important in generating the normal thalamocortical rhythmicity of slow wave sleep, and may be a key element in the production of abnormal rhythms associated with absence epilepsy. Both TCs and nRt cells can generate prominent Ca(2+)-dependent low-threshold spikes, which evoke bursts of Na(+)-dependent fast spikes, and are influential in rhythm generation. Substantial differences in the pattern of burst firing in TCs versus nRt neurons led us to hypothesize that there are distinct forms of transient Ca2+ current (I(T)) underlying burst discharges in these two cell types. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp recordings, we analyzed I(T) in acutely isolated TCs and nRt neurons and found three key differences in biophysical properties. (1) The transient Ca2+ current in nRt neurons inactivated much more slowly than I(T) in TCs. This slow current is thus termed I(Ts). (2) The rate of inactivation for I(Ts) was nearly voltage independent. (3) Whole-cell I(Ts) amplitude was increased when Ba2+ was substituted for Ca2+ as the charge carrier. In addition, activation kinetics were slower for I(Ts) and the activation range was depolarized compared to that for I(T). Other properties of I(Ts) and I(T) were similar, including steady-state inactivation and sensitivities to blockade by divalent cations, amiloride, and antiepileptic drugs. Our findings demonstrate that subtypes of transient Ca2+ current are present in two different classes of thalamic neurons. The properties of I(Ts) lead to generation of long-duration calcium-dependent spike bursts in nRt cells. The resultant prolonged periods of GABA release onto TCs would play a critical role in maintaining rhythmicity by inducing TC hyperpolarization and promoting generation of low-threshold calcium spikes within relay nuclei.},

abstract = {1. Whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques were used to record K+ currents in relay neurons (RNs) that had been acutely isolated from rat thalamic ventrobasal complex and maintained at 23 degrees C in vitro. Tetrodoxin (TTX; 0.5 microM) was used to block Na+ currents, and reduced extracellular levels of Ca2+ (1 mM) were used to minimize contributions from Ca2+ current (ICa). 2. In RNs, depolarizing commands activate K+ currents characterized by a substantial rapidly inactivating (time constant approximately 20 ms) component, the features of which correspond to those of the transient K+ current (IA) in other preparations, and by a smaller, more slowly activating K+ current, “IK”. IA was reversibly blocked by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP, 5 mM), and the reversal potential varied with [K+]o as predicted by the Nernst equation. 3. IA was relatively insensitive to blockade by tetraethylammonium [TEA; 50%-inhibitory concentration (IC50) much much greater than 20 mM]; however, two components of IK were blocked with IC50S of 30 microM and 3 mM. Because 20 mM TEA blocked 90% of the sustained current while reducing IA by less than 10%, this concentration was routinely used in experiments in which IA was isolated and characterized. To further minimize contamination by other conductances, 4-AP was added to TEA-containing solutions and the 4-AP-sensitive current was obtained by subtraction. 4. Voltage-dependent steady-state inactivation of peak IA was described by a Boltzman function with a slope factor (k) of -6.5 and half-inactivation (V1/2) occurring at -75 mV. Activation of IA was characterized by a Boltzman curve with V1/2 = -35 mV and k = 10.8. 5. IA activation and inactivation kinetics were best fitted by the Hodgkin-Huxley m4h formalism. The rate of activation was voltage dependent, with tau m decreasing from 2.3 ms at -40 mV to 0.5 ms at +50 mV. Inactivation was relatively voltage independent and nonexponential. The rate of inactivation was described by two exponential decay processes with time constants (tau h1 and tau h2) of 20 and 60 ms. Both components were steady-state inactivated with similar voltage dependence. 6. Temperature increases within the range of 23-35 degrees C caused IA activation and inactivation rates to become faster, with temperature coefficient (Q10) values averaging 2.8. IA amplitude also increased as a function of temperature, albeit with a somewhat lower Q10 of 1.6. 7. Several voltage-dependent properties of IA closely resemble those of the transient inward Ca2+ current, IT. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Spatial attention modulates signal processing within visual nuclei of the thalamus-but do other nuclei govern the locus of attention in top-down mode? We examined functional MRI (fMRI) data from three subjects performing a task requiring covert attention to 1 of 16 positions in a circular array. Target position was cued after stimulus offset, requiring subjects to perform target detection from iconic visual memory. We found positionally specific responses at multiple thalamic sites, with individual voxels activating at more than one direction of attentional shift. Voxel clusters at anatomically equivalent sites across subjects revealed a broad range of directional tuning at each site, with little sign of contralateral bias. By reference to a thalamic atlas, we identified the nuclear correspondence of the four most reliably activated sites across subjects: mediodorsal/central-intralaminar (oculomotor thalamus), caudal intralaminar/parafascicular, suprageniculate/limitans, and medial pulvinar/lateral posterior. Hence, the cortical network generating a top-down control signal for relocating attention acts in concert with a spatially selective thalamic apparatus-the set of active nuclei mirroring the thalamic territory of cortical “eye-field” areas, thus supporting theories which propose the visuomotor origins of covert attentional selection.},

abstract = {The latencies and visual response properties of 202 X-cells in the A- laminae of the cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) were examined to investigate the recent claim (Mastronarde, ’85,’87a) that functionally different groups of X-cells reside there. Two groups of X-cells were found, which differed in their extracellularly recorded responses to spots of light flashed within their receptive fields. One group, constituting one-third of the sample, responded to spot onset with a profound and often long-lasting dip in discharge rate, such that cell discharge usually did not reach half maximum until 2 100 msec after spot onset. About 70% of these cells also displayed a transient discharge at spot offset. These cells correspond to Mastronarde’s lagged X-cells, and we similarly refer to them as XL-cells. The second group, constituting the remainder of the X-cell population, gen- erally responded to spot onset with a short latency (< 60 msec) brisk discharge, no detectable XL-type dip, and a rapid reduction in firing at spot offset. We refer to these neurons as nonlagged (XN) X-cells; this group probably encompasses all of Mastronarde’s non-XL-cells. Despite some overlap, the XL- and XN-cells differed in numerous other features. Compared to XN-cells, XL-cells exhibited: 1) lower peak rates of discharge and more uniform firing during spot onset; 2) slightly longer latencies and markedly lower probabilities of discharge to optic chiasm stimulation; 3) consistently lower geniculocortical conduction velocities; and 4) markedly lower optimal temporal frequencies when tested with drifting sine wave gratings. No differences were found between the two cell groups in optimal spatial frequency, spatial resolution, or receptive field center size, and there were equal proportions of on- and off-center types of XL- and XN- cells. Analyses of one- and two-dimensional plots of the physiological mea- sures indicate that XL- and XN-cells constitute a physiological continuum. However, the two groups occupy opposite sides of the continuum on many of the measures, with little overlap and with few (<5%) cells with intermedi- ate properties. Therefore, XL-cells may be considered a distinct, readily identifiable group. These findings confirm and extend Mastronarde’s (‘87a) observations on functional differences among geniculate X-cells. The existence of XL-cells in the LGN and their apparent absence in the retina (Mastronarde, ’87b) add support to the view that the LGN operates as more than a simple relay nucleus, passing on to the cortex in largely unaltered form the signals},

abstract = {simple stimuli such as oriented gratings. Experiments involving other types of stimuli, such as natural scenes, higher-order features, and surface brightness, produce single-unit responses that are more difficult to interpret. Experiments with brightness, in particular, evoke single-unit responses that are typically weakly modulated. When the brightness is generated by a visual illusion such as the Cornsweet illusion, statistical tests are often necessary to distinguish true responses from baseline fluctuations. Here, using data collected from cat Areas 17 and 18 in response to real and illusory brightness stimuli, we provide a method for detecting and quantifying weak but significant periodic responses. By randomizing spike trains (via bootstrap methods), we provide confidence levels for response significance, permitting the evaluation of both weak and strong responses. We show that because of a strong dependence on total spike number, response significance can only be appropriately determined with randomized spike trains of similar spike number. Such randomizations can be performed for both stimulus-elicited and spontaneously occurring spike trains. By developing a method for generating randomized modulated spike trains (phase-restricted randomization) from actual recordings, we calculate upper and lower confidence limits of modulated spike trains and describe how measurement precision varies as a function of total spike count. Finally, using this randomization method, we describe how a correction function can be determined to correct for measurement bias introduced at low spike counts. These methods may also be useful in the study of small but potentially significant responses in other systems.},

abstract = {Surround suppression contributes to important functions in visual processing, such as figure-ground segregation; however, this benefit comes at the cost of decreased neuronal sensitivity. Studies of receptive fields at several levels of the visual hierarchy have demonstrated that surround suppression is reduced for low contrast stimuli, thereby improving neuronal sensitivity. We investigated whether this reduction of surround suppression reflects a general processing strategy to boost sensitivity for weak signals by summing them over a larger region of the visual field (spatial integration) or if the reduction is limited to specialized stimulus conditions. To do this, we used stochastic motion stimuli to measure surround suppression in area MT of alert macaque monkeys. While varying stimulus size we also varied the strength of two other critical stimulus features: contrast and coherence (i.e., the proportion of dots moving in the preferred direction of the neuron). We found that reducing stimulus contrast weakened surround suppression, but reducing stimulus coherence had the opposite effect, indicating that diminished surround suppression is not a universal response to stimuli of low signal-to-noise. This can be partially explained by our other finding, which is that surrounds in MT are very broadly direction tuned. Instead of producing a reduction of surround suppression that would improve the ability of the neuron to integrate preferred direction motion, low coherence stimuli activated the broadly tuned surrounds relatively better than the centers, which are generally more direction selective. Our results are consistent with a normalization mechanism of surround suppression that pools broadly across multiple stimulus dimensions.},

A major challenge in cortical physiology is to understand how the neural activity in these numerous active zones leads to a unified percept of the visual sct ne. The anatomical basis for these interactions is the dense network of connections that link the visual areas. Within this network, feedforward connections transmit signals from lower-order areas such as V1 or V2 to higher-order areas. In addition, there is a dense web of feedback connections which, despite their anatomical prominence(1,4), remain functionally mysterious(5-8). Here we show, using reversible inactivation of a higher-order area (monkey area V5/MT), that feedback connections serve to amplify and focus activity of neurons in lower-order areas, and that they are important in the differentiation of figure from ground, particularly in the case of stimuli of low visibility. More specifically, we show that feedback connections facilitate responses to objects moving within the classical receptive field; enhance suppression evoked by background stimuli in the surrounding region; and have the strongest effects for stimuli of low salience.},

Figure/ground coding has been described at the V1 level in the late part of the neuronal responses to visual stimuli, and it has been suggested that these late modulations depend on feedback connections. In the present work we tested whether it actually takes time for this information to be fed back to lower order areas. We analyzed the extracellular responses of 169 V1, V2, and V3 neurons that we recorded in two anesthetized macaque monkeys. MT was inactivated by cooling. We studied the time course of the responses of the neurons that were significantly affected by the inactivation of MT to see whether the effects were delayed relative to the onset of the response. We first measured the time course of the feedback influences from MT on V1, V2, and V3 neurons tested with moving stimuli. For the large majority of the 51 neurons for which the response decreased, the effect was present from the beginning of the response. In the responses averaged after normalization, the decrease of response was significant in the first 10-ms bin of response. A similar result was found for six neurons for which the response significantly increased when MT was inactivated. We then looked at the time course of the responses to flashed stimuli (95 neurons). We observed 15 significant decreases of response and 14 significant increases. In both populations, the effects were significant within the first 10 ms of response. For some neurons with increased responses we even observed a shorter latency when MT was inactivated. We measured the latency of the response to the flashed stimuli. We found that even the earliest responding neurons were affected early by the feedback from MT. This was true for the response to flashed and to moving stimuli. These results show that feedback connections are recruited very early for the treatment of visual information. It further indicates that the presence or absence of feedback effects cannot be deduced from the time course of the response modulations.},

abstract = {We analyzed the extracellular responses of 70 V1 neurons (recorded in 3 anesthetized macaque monkeys) to a single oriented line segment (or bar) placed within the cell classical receptive field (RF), or center of the RF. These responses could be modulated when rings of bars were placed entirely outside, but around the RF (the “near” surround region), as described in previous studies. Suppression was the main effect. The response was enhanced for 12 neurons when orthogonal bars in the surround were presented instead of bars having the same orientation as the center bar. This orientation contrast property is possibly involved in the mediation of perceptual pop-out. The enhancement was delayed compared with the onset of the response by about 40 ms. We also observed a suppression originating specifically from the flanks of the surround. This “side-inhibition,” significant for nine neurons, was delayed by about 20 ms. We tested whether these center/surround interactions in V1 depend on feedback connections from area V2. V2 was inactivated by GABA injections. We used devices made of six micropipettes to inactivate the convergent zone from V2 to V1. We could reliably inactivate a 2- to 4-mm-wide region of V2. Inactivation of V2 had no effect on the center/surround interactions of V1 neurons, even those that were delayed. Therefore the center/surround interactions of V1 neurons that might be involved in pop-out do not appear to depend on feedback connections from V2, at least in the anesthetized monkey. We conclude that these properties are probably shaped by long-range connections within V1 or depend on other feedback connections. The main effect of V2 inactivation was a decrease of the response to the single bar for about 10% of V1 neurons. The decrease was delayed by <20 ms after the response onset. Even the earliest neurons to respond could be affected by the feedback from V2. Together with the results on feedback connections from MT (previous paper), these findings show that feedback connections potentiate the responses to stimulation of the RF center and are recruited very early for the treatment of visual information.},

Maybe surprisingly, many studies show that the brain manipulates these forms of uncertainty in a probabilistically consistent and normative manner, and there is now a rich theoretical literature on the capabilities of populations of neurons to implement computations in the face of uncertainty. However, one major facet of uncertainty has received comparatively little attention: time. In a dynamic, rapidly changing world, data are only temporarily relevant. Here, we analyze the computational consequences of encoding stimulus trajectories in populations of neurons. For the most obvious, simple, instantaneous encoder, the correlations induced by natural, smooth stimuli engender a decoder that requires access to information that is nonlocal both in time and across neurons. This formally amounts to a ruinous representation. We show that there is an alternative encoder that is computationally and representationally powerful in which each spike contributes independent information; it is independently decodable, in other words. We suggest this as an appropriate foundation for understanding time-varying population codes. Furthermore, we show how adaptation to temporal stimulus statistics emerges directly from the demands of simple decoding.},

Spectral analysis revealed 2 components correlating with motion coherence. A first component in the low-frequency domain (approximately 3 Hz), linearly increasing with motion coherence, could be attributed to visual cortex including human area middle temporal (MT) +. A second component oscillating in the alpha frequency range and emerging after stimulus offset showed the inverse dependence on motion coherence and arose from early visual cortex. Based on these results, we first of all conclude that motion coherence is reflected in the population response of human extrastriate cortex. Second, we suggest that the occipital alpha activity represents a gating mechanism protecting visual motion integration in later cortical areas from disturbing upcoming signals.},

abstract = {Neocortical pyramidal neurons in vivo are subject to an intense synaptic background activity but little is known of how this activity affects cellular responsiveness and what function it may serve. These issues were examined in morphologically reconstructed neocortical pyramidal neurons in which synaptic background activity was simulated based on recent measurements in cat parietal cortex. We show that background activity can be decomposed into two components: a tonically active conductance and voltage fluctuations. Previous studies have mostly focused on the conductance effect, revealing that background activity is responsible for a decrease in responsiveness, which imposes severe conditions of coincidence of inputs necessary to discharge the cell. It is shown here, in contrast, that responsiveness is enhanced if voltage fluctuations are taken into account; in this case the model can produce responses to inputs that would normally be subthreshold. This effect is analyzed by dissecting and comparing the different components of background activity, as well as by evaluating the contribution of parameters such as the dendritic morphology, the distribution of leak currents, the value of axial resistivity, the densities of voltage-dependent currents, and the release parameters underlying background activity. Interestingly, the model’s optimal responsiveness was obtained when voltage fluctuations were of the same order as those measured intracellularly in vivo. Possible consequences were also investigated at the population level, where the presence of background activity allowed networks of pyramidal neurons to instantaneously detect inputs that are small compared with the classical detection threshold. These results suggest, at the single-cell level, that the presence of voltage fluctuations has a determining influence on cellular responsiveness and that these should be taken into account in models of background activity. At the network level, we predict that background activity provides the necessary drive for detecting events that would normally be undetectable. Experiments are suggested to explore this possible functional role for background activity.},

The OVS task required the subject to select a target stimulus from among distractors and to make a saccade to the target location (target selection was required for correct performance), whereas the OD task only required a saccade to the target (target selection was not required for correct performance). The local injection of muscimol (5 microg, 1 microl) into the dorsolateral PFC induced a specific deficit in the OVS task but not in the OD task. The deficit in the OVS task was characterized by the disordering of saccades for some (mostly a few) particular target locations as well as by prolongation of the time required for the visual search in most cases. The target locations affected by muscimol were biased to the contralateral visual field. Further, the OVS task with “pop-out” and “non-pop-out” conditions was similarly impaired by muscimol injection. These results suggest that the dorsolateral PFC plays a role in target selection in visual space to guide goal-directed motor acts and particular sites are involved in target selection for a particular visuospatial coordinate. Further, this function of the dorsolateral PFC appears to involve both top-down (active) and bottom-up (passive) target-selection/selective attention processes to control interfering information (distractors).},

Recent behavioral experiments show evidence for the integration of pre- and postsaccadic information (even subliminally), the modulation of visual sensitivity, and the rapid reallocation of attention. The recent physiological literature has identified a characteristic modulation of neural responsiveness-perisaccadic reduction followed by a postsaccadic increase-that is found in many visual areas, but whose source is as yet unknown. This modulation seems optimal for reducing sensitivity during and boosting sensitivity between saccades, but no study has yet established a direct causal link between neural and behavioral changes.},

abstract = {The function of the corticogeniculate feedback pathway from the striate cortex (V1) to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) in primates is not well understood. Insight into possible function can be gained by studying the morphology and projection patterns of corticogeniculate axons in the LGN. The goal of this research was to examine how corticogeniculate axons innervate the functionally specific (e.g., parvocellular [P], magnocellular [M], and koniocellular [K]) and eye-specific layers of the LGN. Pressure injections of biotinylated dextran were made into owl monkey V1, and the resulting labeled axons were reconstructed through serial sections of the LGN. All of the corticogeniculate axons, regardless of termination pattern, were thin with boutons en passant or at the ends of small stalks, as described in cats. Axons were found in all layers of the LGN, and two main patterns of innervation were observed. In the first pattern, axons terminated in individual M or P LGN layers. In the second pattern of innervation, axons terminated in pairs of functionally matched layers. Examples of this type were seen within pairs of M, P, or K layers. In most cases, both classes of axons contain arbors focused within the P or M layers but also had collateral side branches in neighboring K layers. Unlike corticogeniculate axons seen in the cat, corticogeniculate axons in the owl monkey maintained topographic innervation in the LGN layers that was consistent with receptive field sizes represented in V1. The patterns of layer projections along with the retinotopic match of corticogeniculate axons within the LGN suggest that in primates V1 can modulate activity in the LGN through functionally specific projections in a more tightly tuned retinotopic fashion than previously believed.},

abstract = {In primary visual cortex (V1), neuronal responses to optimally oriented stimuli in the receptive field (RF) center are usually suppressed by iso-oriented stimuli in the RF surround. The mechanisms and pathways giving rise to surround modulation, a possible neural correlate of perceptual figure-ground segregation, are not yet identified. We previously proposed that highly divergent and fast-conducting top-down feedback connections are the substrate for fast modulation arising from the more distant regions of the surround. We have recently implemented this idea into a recurrent network model (Schwabe et al. 2006). The purpose of this study was to test a crucial prediction of this feedback model, namely that the suppressive “far” surround of V1 neurons can be facilitatory under conditions that weakly activate neurons in the RF center. Using single-unit recordings in macaque V1, we found iso-orientation far-surround facilitation when the RF center was driven by a low-contrast stimulus and the far surround by a small annular stimulus. Suppression occurred when the center stimulus contrast or the size of the surround stimulus was increased. This suggests that center-surround interactions result from excitatory and inhibitory mechanisms of similar spatial extent, and that changes in the balance of local excitation and inhibition, induced by surround stimulation, determine whether facilitation or suppression occurs. In layer 4C, the main target of geniculocortical afferents, lacking long-range intra-cortical connections, far-surround facilitation was rare and large surround fields were absent. This strongly suggests that feedforward connections do not contribute to far-surround modulation and that the latter is generated by intra-cortical mechanisms, likely involving top-down feedback.},

abstract = {In primates, feedforward visual pathways from retina to lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are segregated to different layers. These layers also receive strong reciprocal feedback pathways from cortex. The degree to which feedforward streams in primates are segregated from feedback streams remains unclear. Here, we asked whether corticogeniculate cells that innervate the magnocellular (M), parvocellular (P), and koniocellular (K) layers of the LGN in the prosimian primate bush baby (Otolemur garnettii) can be distinguished based on either the laminar distribution or morphological characteristics of their axons and synaptic contacts in LGN, or on their cell body position, size, and dendritic distribution in cortex. Corticogeniculate axons and synapses were labeled anterogradely with biotinylated dextran injections in layer 6 of cortex. Corticogeniculate cell bodies were first labeled with fluorescent dextran injections limited to individual M, P, or K LGN layers and then filled with biotinylated Lucifer yellow. Results showed that feedback to the M or P LGN layers arises from cells with dendrites primarily confined to cortical layer 6 and axons restricted to either M or P LGN layers, but not both. Feedback to K LGN layers arises from cells: 1) whose dendrites distribute rather evenly across cortical layers 5 and 6; 2) whose dendrites always extend into layer 4; and 3) whose axons are never confined to K layers but always overlap with either P or M layers. Corticogeniculate axons also showed distributions that were retinotopically precise based on known receptive field sizes of layer 6 cells, and these axons mainly made synapses with glutamatergic projection neurons in the LGN in all layers. Taken together with prior physiological results, we argue that the morphological differences between the three corticogeniculate pathways show that the M and P feedback pathways could rapidly and specifically enhance local LGN activity, while we speculate that the K feedback pathway is organized to temporally synchronize activity between LGN and cortex.},

abstract = {1. Post-stimulus histograms were obtained from ;sustained’ and ;transient’ retinal ganglion cells for receptive field plots using a light spot with square-wave modulation of intensity, and of variable intensity and area. Fundamental differences in their receptive field organization in time and space were revealed.2. In ;sustained’ cells, excitation consists of ;transient’ and ;sustained’ components and the ratio of transient/sustained components remains constant at a given retinal locus for a wide range of intensities. The transient component becomes proportionally larger towards the periphery of the receptive field. This rule is also applicable for the inhibitory and disinhibitory surround. In ;transient’ cells, however, there is no true ;sustained’ component, but some cells produce a double peaked transient post-stimulus histogram at the R.F. centre when high flux stimuli are used, while others show a single peak transient response. The magnitude and shape of transient responses changes with intensity as well as with location in the receptive field.3. The sensitivity gradients of ;sustained’ and ;transient’ cells show consistent differences in shape. The mean slope of the sensitivity gradients of a sample of ;sustained’ cells was 10 times that of a sample of ;transient’ cells. The sensitivity gradient of ;sustained’ cells shows a distinct surround region where the inhibitory mechanism is more sensitive, while that of ;transient’ cells usually does not, owing to an extensive ;tail’ on the sensitivity gradient of the centre mechanism, which overlaps the surround.4. Ricco’s Law also holds for the centre mechanism of ;transient’ cells. Non-linear summation occurs at supra-threshold levels, and when the surround mechanisms are involved.5. Supra-optimal stimuli give a saturation of the response in both ;transient and ;sustained’ cells. This saturation is associated with a decrease of latency in ;transient’ cells, but not in ;sustained’ cells.6. The latency of retinal ganglion cells is determined by both stimulus and background flux. The effect of the background is negligible except at low values of stimulus flux, where its effect may be analysed primarily in terms of its effect on the incremental threshold.7. The latency to stimulation with a standard small spot (25-27’) at the receptive field centre is shorter for ;sustained’ cells than for ;transient’ cells; this latency difference being related to the greater sensitivity of the ;sustained’ cells to stimuli of this size. Differences in conduction time along ;transient’ and ;sustained’ pathways to the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and cortex were estimated, and it is concluded that despite the latency difference noted above, a response to a stimulus which is optimal for a ;transient’ cell reaches the cortex faster than the response to a stimulus which is optimal for a ;sustained’ cell.8. The above results together with previous evidence available suggest that for most stimuli, centre and surround mechanisms are activated simultaneously and algebraically summed by a single linear stage in ;sustained’ cells. In ;transient’ cells, although the centre excitation and surround inhibition pools are also spatially co-extensive, they summate and interact in time and space with a greater complexity.9. Differences in the receptive field organization of ;sustained’ and ;transient’ cells may reflect their different functional roles in vision: (1) analysis of spatial contrast and form recognition (sustained’ cells), and (2) fast detection of objects entering visual space to cause orientation responses (transient’ cells).},

We studied the activity of neurons in monkey lateral intraparietal area while monkeys performed a visual search task. The monkeys were free to move their eyes, and a distractor, but never the search target, popped out. On trials in which the monkeys made a saccade directly to the search target, the popout distractor evoked a smaller response than the non-popout distractors. The intensity of the response to the popout correlated inversely with the monkeys’ ability to ignore it. We suggest that this modulation corresponds to a top-down mechanism that the brain uses to adjust the parietal representation of salience.},

Here we find a very strong correlation between synchronized oscillatory activity in a class of frog retinal ganglion cells (dimming detectors) and a well-known escape response, as shown by behavioral tests and multi-electrode recordings from isolated retinas. Escape behavior elicited by an expanding dark spot was suppressed and potentiated by intraocular injection of GABAA receptor and GABAC receptor antagonists, respectively. Changes in escape behavior correlated with antagonist-evoked changes in synchronized oscillatory activity but not with changes in the discharge rate of dimming detectors. These antagonists did not affect the expanding dark spot−induced responses in retinal ganglion cells other than dimming detectors. Thus, synchronized oscillations in the retina are likely to encode escape-related information in frogs.},

abstract = {Precisely synchronized neuronal activity has been commonly observed in the mammalian visual pathway. Spike timing correlations in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) often take the form of phase synchronized oscillations in the high gamma frequency range. To study the relations between oscillatory activity, synchrony, and their time-dependent properties, we recorded activity from multiple single units in the cat LGN under stimulation by stationary spots of light. Autocorrelation analysis showed that approximately one third of the cells exhibited oscillatory firing with a mean frequency ∼80 Hz. Cross-correlation analysis showed that 30% of unit pairs showed significant synchronization, and 61% of these pairs consisted of synchronous oscillations. Cross-correlation analysis assumes that synchronous firing is stationary and maintained throughout the period of stimulation. We tested this assumption by applying unitary events analysis (UEA). We found that UEA was more sensitive to weak and transient synchrony than cross-correlation analysis and detected a higher incidence (49% of cell pairs) of significant synchrony (unitary events). In many unit pairs, the unitary events were optimally characterized at a bin width of 1 ms, indicating that neural synchrony has a high degree of temporal precision. We also found that approximately one half of the unit pairs showed nonstationary changes in synchrony that could not be predicted by the modulation of firing rates. Population statistics showed that the onset of synchrony between LGN cells occurred significantly later than that observed between retinal afferents and LGN cells. The synchrony detected among unit pairs recorded on separate tetrodes tended to be more transient and have a later onset than that observed between adjacent units. These findings show that stimulus-evoked synchronous activity within the LGN is often rhythmic, highly nonstationary, and modulated by endogenous processes that are not tightly correlated with firing rate.},

The activity of hippocampal neurons appears to reflect such a relationship, representing not only instantaneous position but also the path towards a goal location. However, how the hippocampus obtains information about goal direction is poorly understood. Here we report a prefrontal-thalamic neural circuit that is required for hippocampal representation of routes or trajectories through the environment. Trajectory-dependent firing was observed in medial prefrontal cortex, the nucleus reuniens of the thalamus, and the CA1 region of the hippocampus in rats. Lesioning or optogenetic silencing of the nucleus reuniens substantially reduced trajectory-dependent CA1 firing. Trajectory-dependent activity was almost absent in CA3, which does not receive nucleus reuniens input. The data suggest that projections from medial prefrontal cortex, via the nucleus reuniens, are crucial for representation of the future path during goal-directed behaviour and point to the thalamus as a key node in networks for long-range communication between cortical regions involved in navigation.},

Applied in a chronometric design over early visual cortex (EVC), TMS has proved valuable in indicating at which particular time point EVC must remain unperturbed for (conscious) vision to be established. In the current study, we set out to examine the effect of EVC TMS across a broad range of time points, both before (pre-stimulus) and after (post-stimulus) the onset of symbolic visual stimuli. Behavioral priming studies have shown that the behavioral impact of a visual stimulus can be independent from its conscious perception, suggesting two independent neural signatures. To assess whether TMS-induced suppression of visual awareness can be dissociated from behavioral priming in the temporal domain, we thus implemented three different measures of visual processing, namely performance on a standard visual discrimination task, a subjective rating of stimulus visibility, and a visual priming task. To control for non-neural TMS effects, we performed electrooculographical recordings, placebo TMS (sham), and control site TMS (vertex). Our results suggest that, when considering the appropriate control data, the temporal pattern of EVC TMS disruption on visual discrimination, subjective awareness and behavioral priming are not dissociable. Instead, TMS to EVC disrupts visual perception holistically, both when applied before and after the onset of a visual stimulus. The current findings are discussed in light of their implications on models of visual awareness and (subliminal) priming.},

For example, a spot of light can be characterized by its position, but it does not contribute any information about orientation. However, when moved fast enough, a continuous streak along its trajectory is perceived that helps to determine the orientation of the movement path. The question arises whether the processing of the trajectory and its orientation are simultaneously represented in the primary visual cortex. Here I show that decoding neural population activity within a two-dimensional parameter space represents both (1) physical input given by the actual position of the moving spot and (2) orientation. This latter parameter has no physical counterpart in the stimulus but must be actively formed by spatiotemporal integration of the spot’s trajectory.},

In response to flashed stationary squares (0.4 deg) we obtained localized activity distributions in visual field coordinates, which we referred to as profiles across a ‘population receptive field’ (PRF). We here show how motion trajectories can be derived from activity across the PRF and how the representation of moving and flashed stimuli differs in position. We found that motion was represented by peaks of population activity that followed the stimulus with a speed-dependent lag. However, time-to-peak latencies were shorter by approximately 16 ms compared to the population responses to stationary flashes. In addition, motion representation showed a directional bias, as latencies were more reduced for peripheral-to-central motion compared to the opposite direction. We suggest that a moving stimulus provides ‘preactivation’ that allows more rapid processing than for a single flash event.},

abstract = {We recorded spike activity of single neurones in the middle temporal visual cortical area (MT or V5) of anaesthetised macaque monkeys. We used flashing, stationary spatially circumscribed, cone-isolating and luminance-modulated stimuli of uniform fields to assess the effects of signals originating from the long-, medium- or short- (S) wavelength-sensitive cone classes. Nearly half (41/86) of the tested MT neurones responded reliably to S-cone-isolating stimuli. Response amplitude in the majority of the neurones tested further (19/28) was significantly reduced, though not always completely abolished, during reversible inactivation of visuotopically corresponding regions of the ipsilateral primary visual cortex (striate cortex, area V1). Thus, the present data indicate that signals originating in S-cones reach area MT, either via V1 or via a pathway that does not go through area V1. We did not find a significant difference between the mean latencies of spike responses of MT neurones to signals that bypass V1 and those that do not; the considerable overlap we observed precludes the use of spike-response latency as a criterion to define the routes through which the signals reach MT.},

abstract = {In this paper, we review the path taken by signals originating from the short wavelength sensitive cones (S-cones) in Old World and New World primates. Two types of retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) carrying S-cone signals (blue-On and blue-Off cells) project to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) in the thalamus. In all primates, these S-cone signals are relayed through the ‘dust-like’ (konis in classical Greek) dLGN cells. In New World primates such as common marmoset, these very small cells are known to form distinct and spatially extensive, koniocellular layers. Although in Old World primates, such as macaques, koniocellular layers tend to be very thin, the adjacent parvocellular layers contain distinct koniocellular extensions. It appears that all S-cone signals are relayed through such konio cells, whether they are in the main koniocellular layers or in their colonies within the parvocellular layers of the dLGN. In the primary visual cortex, these signals begin to merge with the signals carried by the other two principal parallel channels, namely the magnocellular and parvocellular channels. This article will also review the possible routes taken by the S-cone signals to reach one of the topographically organised extrastriate visual cortical areas, the middle temporal area (area MT). This area is the major conduit for signals reaching the parietal cortex. Alternative visual inputs to area MT not relayed via the primary visual cortex area (V1) may provide the neurological basis for the phenomenon of ‘blindsight’ observed in human and non-human primates, who have partial or complete damage to the primary visual cortex. Short wavelength sensitive cone (S-cone) signals to area MT may also play a role in directing visual attention with possible implications for understanding the pathology in dyslexia and some of its treatment options.},

abstract = {Perceptual illusions are usually thought to arise from the way sensory signals are encoded by the brain, and indeed are often used to infer the mechanisms of sensory encoding1. But perceptual illusions might also result from the way the brain decodes sensory information2, reflecting the strategies that optimize performance in particular tasks. In a fine discrimination task, the most accurate information comes from neurons tuned away from the discrimination boundary3, 4, and observers seem to use signals from these ‘displaced’ neurons to optimize their performance5, 6, 7. We wondered whether using signals from these neurons might also bias perception. In a fine direction discrimination task using moving random-dot stimuli, we found that observers’ perception of the direction of motion is indeed biased away from the boundary. This misperception can be accurately described by a decoding model that preferentially weights signals from neurons whose responses best discriminate those directions. In a coarse discrimination task, to which a different decoding rule applies4, the same stimulus is not misperceived, suggesting that the illusion is a direct consequence of the decoding strategy that observers use to make fine perceptual judgments. The subjective experience of motion is therefore not mediated directly by the responses of sensory neurons, but is only developed after the responses of these neurons are decoded.},

This paper focuses on our current knowledge of the dynamics the receptive field (RF) as broken down into the classical receptive field (CRF) and the extra-classical receptive field (ECRF) in primate LGN. CRFs in the LGN are known to be similar to those in the retinal ganglion cell layer in terms of both spatial and temporal characteristics, leading to the standard interpretation of the LGN as a relay center from retina to primary visual cortex. ECRFs have generally been found to be large and inhibitory, with some differences in magnitude between the magno-, parvo-, and koniocellular pathways. The specific contributions of the retina, thalamus, and visual cortex to LGN ECRF properties are presently unknown. Some reports suggest a retinal origin for extra-classical suppression based on latency arguments and other reports have suggested a thalamic origin for extra-classical suppression. This issue is complicated by the use of anesthetized animals, where cortical activity is likely to be altered. Thus further study of LGN ECRFs is warranted to reconcile these discrepancies. Producing descriptions of RF properties of LGN neurons could be enhanced by employing preferred naturalistic stimuli. Although there has been significant work in cats with natural scene stimuli and noise that statistically imitates natural scenes, we highlight a need for similar data from primates. Obtaining these data may be aided by recent advancements in experimental and analytical techniques that permit the efficient study of nonlinear RF characteristics in addition to traditional linear factors. In light of the reviewed topics, we conclude by suggesting experiments to more clearly elucidate the spatial and temporal structure of ECRFs of primate LGN neurons.},

year = {2015}, 
abstract = {One of the main tasks of the visual system is to combine the edges and surfaces of individual objects into a perceptual group, and thus create a representation of visual scenes in which multiple objects are segregated from the background. Many studies have focused on how single objects (usually simple figures, like small squares) are segregated. These studies have shown thatthe firing rate of a given cell in early visual cortex is greater when its receptive field (RF) overlaps with a figure than when it falls on a background. The increase in firing rate is referred to as figure–ground modulation (Lamme, 1995). Cells in early visual areas also encode the borders of figures. These cells often show a preference for a particular border of a figure (e.g., the left or right side) in their RF. This preference is termed border-ownership selectivity (Qiu et al., 2007). Recent research has begun toinvestigate how more realistic natural scenes with multiple, complex objects are represented in the primate visual system, how figure–ground modulation and border-ownership selectivity interact with each other, and how attention influences these signals. So far, two main hypotheses have been proposed to explain the neural representation of multiple objects in the primate visualsystem. Early visual areas could either use a “rate code,” in which different figures are encoded by different firing rates, or a “synchrony code,” in which neurons that represent the same object fire in synchrony. Two exciting recent studies have examined how multiple objects in the visual scene are segregated from their background. Gilad and Slovin (2015) suggest that separateobjects are labeled by different levels of activity in V1. Martin and von der Heydt (2015) suggest that feedback from cells in highervisual areas influences the synchrony between cells in lower area: cells which receive feedback from a common source are more likely to fire synchronous spikes. The authors test this idea by measuring the synchrony between cells representing the borders ofobjects to study their connectivity. Both studies make use of recordings in the visual cortex of awake, behaving monkeys performing attention-demanding behavioral tasks.},

We have demonstrated recently an important role for sleep in ocular dominance (OD) plasticity, a classic form of in vivo cortical remodeling triggered by monocular deprivation (MD) during a critical period of development. The mechanisms responsible for the effects of sleep on OD plasticity are unknown but may depend on neuronal activity in the sleeping brain. We investigated the role of cortical activity in sleep-dependent plasticity by reversibly inactivating the sleeping visual cortex (V1) after a period of MD. Critical period cats were bilaterally implanted with cannulas in V1 and standard EEG/EMG electrodes for polysomnographic recording. After a period of MD, visual cortices were infused with the sodium channel blocker lidocaine in vehicle or vehicle only during sleep. A third group of cats served as sham controls and were infused with lidocaine outside of V1 (into the CSF). Both optical imaging of intrinsic cortical signals and microelectrode recordings showed that OD plasticity was significantly reduced in cats whose visual cortices were reversibly silenced during sleep. These findings demonstrate that the mechanisms governing this form of sleep-dependent plasticity require cortical activity. They provide an important insight into how sleep modifies synaptic circuitry by narrowing the range of possible candidate mechanisms to those that are activity dependent.},

pages = {54}, 
year = {2015}, 
abstract = {Uncovering the relationship between sensory neural responses and perceptual decisions remains a fundamental problem in neuroscience. Decades of experimental and modeling work in the sensory cortex have demonstrated that a perceptual decision pool is usually composed of tens to hundreds of neurons, the responses of which are significantly correlated not only with each other, but also with the behavioral choices of an animal. Few studies, however, have measured neural activity in the sensory thalamus of awake, behaving animals. Therefore, it remains unclear how many thalamic neurons are recruited and how the information from these neurons is pooled at subsequent cortical stages to form a perceptual decision. In a previous study we measured neural activity in the macaque lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) during a two alternative forced choice (2AFC) contrast detection task, and found that single LGN neurons were significantly correlated with the monkeys’ behavioral choices, despite their relatively poor contrast sensitivity and a lack of overall interneuronal correlations. We have now computationally tested a number of specific hypotheses relating these measured LGN neural responses to the contrast detection behavior of the animals. We modeled the perceptual decisions with different numbers of neurons and using a variety of pooling/readout strategies, and found that the most successful model consisted of about 50-200 LGN neurons, with individual neurons weighted differentially according to their signal-to-noise ratios (quantified as d-primes). These results supported the hypothesis that in contrast detection the perceptual decision pool consists of multiple thalamic neurons, and that the response fluctuations in these neurons can influence contrast perception, with the more sensitive thalamic neurons likely to exert a greater influence.},

In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), cells show distinct properties such as selectivity for particular wavelengths, increments or decrements in contrast, or preference for fine detail versus rapid motion. No studies, however, have measured how LGN cells respond when an animal is challenged to make a perceptual decision using information within the receptive fields of those LGN cells. In this study we measured neural activity in the macaque LGN during a two-alternative, forced-choice (2AFC) contrast detection task or during a passive fixation task and found that a small proportion (13.5%) of single LGN parvocellular (P) and magnocellular (M) neurons matched the psychophysical performance of the monkey. The majority of LGN neurons measured in both tasks were not as sensitive as the monkey. The covariation between neural response and behavior (quantified as choice probability) was significantly above chance during active detection, even when there was no external stimulus. Interneuronal correlations and task-related gain modulations were negligible under the same condition. A bottom-up pooling model that used sensory neural responses to compute perceptual choices in the absence of interneuronal correlations could fully explain these results at the level of the LGN, supporting the hypothesis that the perceptual decision pool consists of multiple sensory neurons and that response fluctuations in these neurons can influence perception.},

Few studies, however, have directly examined the neural underpinning of visual perception in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), only one synapse away from the retina. In this study we recorded from LGN parvocellular (P) ON-center and OFF-center neurons while monkeys either passively viewed or actively detected a full range of contrasts. We found that OFF neurons were more sensitive in detecting negative contrasts than ON neurons were in detecting positive contrasts. Also, OFF neurons had higher spontaneous activities, higher peak response amplitudes, and were more sustained than ON neurons in their contrast responses. Puzzlingly, OFF neurons failed to show any significant correlations with the monkeys’ perceptual choices, despite their greater contrast sensitivities. If, however, choice probabilities were calculated from interspike intervals instead of spike counts (thus taking into account the higher firing rates of OFF neurons), OFF neurons but not ON neurons were significantly correlated with behavioral choices. Taken together, these results demonstrate in awake, behaving animals that: 1) the ON and OFF pathways do not simply mirror each other in their functionality but instead carry qualitatively different types of information, and 2) the responses of ON and OFF neurons can be correlated with perceptual choices even in the absence of physical stimuli and interneuronal correlations.},

Consistent with this functional independence of channels, we demonstrate here that on- and off-center geniculate afferents segregate in different domains of the cat primary visual cortex and that off responses dominate the cortical representation of the area centralis. On average, 70% of the geniculate afferents converging at the same cortical domain had receptive fields of the same contrast polarity. Moreover, off-center afferents dominated the representation of the area centralis in the cortex, but not in the thalamus, indicating that on- and off-center afferents are balanced in number, but not in the amount of cortical territory that they cover.},

However, it was also found that the preferred orientations of neurons shift away from the adapting orientation.

In this article, we offer an approach to thinking about variation in brain structure and function that pulls us outside the sex differences formulation. We argue that the existence of differences between the brains of males and females does not unravel the relations between sex and the brain nor is it sufficient to characterize a population of brains. Such characterization is necessary for studying sex effects on the brain as well as for studying brain structure and function in general. Animal studies show that sex interacts with environmental, developmental and genetic factors to affect the brain. Studies of humans further suggest that human brains are better described as belonging to a single heterogeneous population rather than two distinct populations. We discuss the implications of these observations for studies of brain and behaviour in humans and in laboratory animals. We believe that studying sex effects in context and developing or adopting analytical methods that take into account the heterogeneity of the brain are crucial for the advancement of human health and well-being.},

abstract = {For practical clinical purposes, as well as because of their deep philosophical implications, it becomes increasingly important to be aware of contemporary studies of the brain mechanisms that generate subjective experiences. Current research has progressed to the point where plausible theoretical proposals can be made about the neurophysiological and neurochemical processes which mediate perception and sustain subjective awareness. An adequate theory of consciousness must describe how information about the environment is encoded by the exogenous system, how memories are stored in the endogenous system and released appropriately for the present circumstances, how the exogenous and endogenous systems interact to produce perception, and explain how consciousness arises from that interaction. Evidence assembled from a variety of neuroscience areas, together with the invariant reversible electrophysiological changes observed with loss and return of consciousness in anesthesia as well as distinctive quantitative electroencephalographic profiles of various psychiatric disorders, provides an empndation for this theory of consciousness. This evidence suggests the need for a paradigm shift to explain how the brain accomplishes the transformation from synchronous and distributed neuronal discharges to seamless global subjective awareness. This chapter undertakes to provide a detailed description and explanation of these complex processes by experimental evidence marshaled from a wide variety of sources.},

Time perception has traditionally been thought to be entirely dissociated from spatial vision. Here we show that the apparent duration of a dynamic stimulus can be manipulated in a local region of visual space by adapting to oscillatory motion or flicker. This implicates spatially localized temporal mechanisms in duration perception. We do not see concomitant changes in the time of onset or offset of the test patterns, demonstrating a direct local effect on duration perception rather than an indirect effect on the time course of neural processing. The effects of adaptation on duration perception can also be dissociated from motion or flicker perception per se. Although 20 Hz adaptation reduces both the apparent temporal frequency and duration of a 10 Hz test stimulus, 5 Hz adaptation increases apparent temporal frequency but has little effect on duration perception. We conclude that there is a peripheral, spatially localized, essentially visual component involved in sensing the duration of visual events.},

abstract = {The corticothalamic system is organized to play a key role in synchronizing the activities of thalamic and cortical neurons. Its synapses dominate the inputs to relay cells and to the GABAergic cells of the reticular nucleus; its organization in focused and diffuse projections promotes both coherent activity of relay neurons and the spread of activity across the cortex and thalamus. The capacity of relay neurons to operate in voltage-dependent tonic or burst mode permits corticothalamic inputs to directly excite the relay cells or indirectly inhibit them via the reticular nucleus. This enables the corticothalamic projection to synchronize high- or low-frequency oscillatory activity, respectively, in the thalamo-corticothalamic network. Differences in the subunit composition of AMPA receptors at synapses formed by branches of the same corticothalamic axon in the reticular nucleus and dorsal thalamus are an important element in the capacity of the cortex to synchronize low-frequency oscillations in the network. Intrinsic voltage-gated calcium channels of different kinds expressed in the relay neurons form a substrate for corticothalamic interactions with the relay cells that promote high- or low-frequency oscillations. Focused corticothalamic axons arising from layer VI cortical cells and diffuse corticothalamic axons arising from layer V cortical cells, in conjunction with the core and matrix cells of the dorsal thalamus, form a substrate for synchronization of widespread populations of cortical and thalamic cells during high-frequency oscillations that underlie discrete conscious events.},

We explored the influence of varying the diameter of a patch of grating centred over the receptive field and quantitatively determined the optimal summation diameter and the degree of surround suppression for cells at both levels of the visual system using the same stimulus parameters. The mean optimal summation size for LGN cells (0.90 degrees) was much smaller than that of cortical cells (3.58 degrees). Virtually all LGN cells exhibited strong surround suppression with a mean value of 74%+/-1.61% SEM for the population as a whole. This potent surround suppression in the cells providing the input to the cortex suggests that cortical cells must integrate their much larger summation fields from the low firing rates associated with the suppression plateau of the LGN cell responses. Our data suggest that the strongest input to cortical cells will arise from geniculate cells representing areas of visual space located at the borders of a visual stimulus. We suggest that analysis of response properties by patterns centred over the receptive fields of cells may give a misleading impression of the process of the representation. Analysis of pattern terminations or salient borders over the receptive field may provide much more insight into the processing algorithms involved in stimulus representation.},

In order to examine the functional organisation of this projection we used iontophoretic application of drugs (Jones et al Soc NSc Abs 2000) to produce a focal enhancement or decrement of visual responses in MT whilst recording from electrode arrays in V1. Effects were evaluated in the context of visual stimuli configured to take note of the relative CRF locations and response selectivity of the V1 and MT cells. Effects of focal gain shifts in MT were not restricted to laminae receiving feedback connections in V1 but were found through all layers. Presumably, this reflects the inter-connectivity between layers in primate V1 (Callaway 1998). Similarly we observed focal changes in visual responsiveness in layers 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6 of MT provoked changes in V1 responses. We emphasise our manipulations simply increased or decreased visual responses in MT. These produced changes in the dynamic behavior of the circuitry with consequent gain changes reflecting through the reciprocal interconnections linking different layers and levels of the system. We also examined the characteristics of the spatial changes in visual response zones of V1 cells utilising the adaptation of circular statistics described by Xiao et al (1997). The majority but not all of the effects of focal gain shifts in MT were an asymmetric change in the response zones of individual V1 cells. These data provocatively suggest that changes in segments of the hierarchical network propagate seamlessly throughout the neural stream, clearly influencing V1 output globally.},

abstract = {We have explored the spatial organization of orientation contrast effects in primate V1. Our stimuli were either concentric patches of drifting grating of varying orientation and diameter or grating patches displaced in x-y coordinates around a central patch overlying the classical receptive field (CRF). All cells in the sample exhibited response suppression to iso-oriented stimuli exceeding the CRF. Changing the outer stimulus orientation revealed five response patterns: 1) orientation alignment suppression (17% of cells)-a suppressive component tuned to the same orientation as the cell’s optimal, 2) orientation contrast facilitation (63%)-responses to orientation contrast stimuli exceeded those to the center stimulus alone, 3) nonorientation specific suppression (3%), 4) mixed general suppression and alignment suppression (14%), and 5) orientation contrast suppression (14%)-cross-oriented stimuli evoked stronger suppression than iso-oriented stimuli. Thus most cells (94%) showed larger responses to orientation contrast stimuli than to iso-oriented stimuli, and over one-half showed orientation contrast facilitation. There appeared to be a spatially structured organization of the zones driving the different response patterns with respect to the CRF. Nonorientation-specific suppression and orientation contrast suppression were predominantly evoked by orientation contrast borders located within the CRF, and orientation contrast facilitation was mainly driven by surround stimuli lying outside the CRF. This led to different response patterns according to border location. Zones driving orientation contrast facilitation were not necessarily contiguous to, nor uniformly distributed around, the CRF. Our data support two processes underlying orientation contrast enhancement effects: a simple variation in the strength of surround suppression drawing on the fact that surround suppression is tuned to the same orientation as the CRF and a second process driven by orientation contrast that enhanced cells’ responses to CRF stimulation by either dis-inhibition or orientation contrast facilitation. We suggest these processes may serve to enhance response levels to salient image features such as junctions and corners and may contribute to orientation pop-out.},

abstract = {There is widespread recognition that the interaction between MT and V1 is complex and that processing in V1 can be strongly influenced by feedback from MT. It is also emerging that feedback from MT can influence, via layer 6 of V1, the responses of LGN relay cells that provide the input to V1. Whilst the global nature of these effects are recognized, there is little information on the spatial organization of the influence fed back from a focus in MT to V1 and then in turn to the LGN. We have attempted to provide an insight into this issue by focal pharmacological manipulation of visual response magnitude in area MT whilst assessing the way the location of a discrete visual stimulus with respect to the monitored MT field, influences the feedback effects on cells in V1 and the LGN. 
These results draw on analysis of 35 MT cells paired with 86 cells in V1 and 55 cells in the LGN. In both V1 and the LGN the feedback can increase or decrease the visual response magnitude of cells. In V1 there is strong correlation of effect with receptive field type. At both levels in the system we observed effects at spatial locations ahead of and behind the stimulus focus in MT, suggesting that the feedback exerted a coherent and potentially predictive influence on the way the visual information is processed at earlier levels in the system. We compared this for effects on visual response magnitude and resting discharge where possible. Our data underline the view that a spatially discrete moving stimulus driving MT exerts widespread effects on the processing of visual information in the retinotopic matrices of V1 and the LGN that have the capacity to align network behaviour to the global implications of the stimulus and the way information is processed for a range of parallel and ongoing attributes of the stimulus.},

abstract = {MT provides feedback to V1 that includes the upper and lower parts of layer 6 which in turn provide feedback to the LGN. This suggests the potential for a fast feedback loop from MT to LGN. We have previously shown that MT does indeed influence the response properties of LGN cells. Here we report results from the effects of focally increasing or decreasing response magnitude in an MT direction column on LGN cell properties. The results from 104 cells suggest a structured pattern of influence that links to the proximity of the LGN receptive fields to the MT field, the vector angle of the location of the LGN cell field with respect to the centre of the MT cell receptive field and its preferred direction, and the direction of stimulus motion.
Many LGN cells showed a notable shift in the locus of their response when the activity of an MT direction column was enhanced. This was linked to the relative proximity of LGN and MT cell receptive fields with a significantly greater proportion of non-overlapping cells showing shifts in their response foci than overlapping cells (p<0.05, Chi-squared test). It was also linked to the relationship between the MT cells’ preferred direction of motion and the angular vector joining the MT and LGN cell receptive fields. There was a significant difference (p<0.05, Kolmogorov-Smirnov two sample test) in the distribution of the angular difference between these two vectors for the cell groups that showed and did not show shifts in response foci. In essence, we found that cells where the angular link was approximately parallel to the MT cell’s preferred direction were most likely to show a shift in angular vector, whilst conversely those that were orthogonal were most likely to show no shift in angular vector. Over 80% of the cells tested showed a significant change in the balance of their responses to a stimulus drifting in the MT columns preferred and non preferred directions when the response magnitude in the MT column was increased or decreased. These emergent asymmetries in LGN cells directional responses indicate that their normal responses to moving stimuli are heavily structured by the feedback originating from MT.},

This distinction would have important functional implications if true and both these values are considerably less than the average values reported for cortical V1 cells (Jones et al. 2001, Sceniak et al. 2001). We have explored the average degree of patch suppression in parvocellular cells in the macaque using carefully centred patches of drifting sinusoidal grating of varying diameter presented in a randomised interleaved sequence. We find that many parvocellular cells have very strong patch suppression (figure 1) and that the mean degree of patch suppression for parvocellular cells is 80.8% (± 3.68 SE). This is in accord with observations from the study of Sceniak et al. (2006) where they recorded from geniculo-cortical afferents in V1 after cortical inactivation. We suggest that the issue of the patch suppression of primate parvocellular cells needs to be reconsidered and that the evidence points to a high degree of suppression in accord with that characterising primate V1 cells as a whole (Jones et al. 2001, Sceniak et al. 2001).

abstract = {The spatial properties of primate LGN cells derive from the confluence of a series of processes which include a direct excitatory input from retinal ganglion cells, inhibitory input from intrinsic inhibitory interneurons, reflected inhibitory input from TRN cells driven by collaterals of the LGN relay cells and feedback from layer 6 of the visual cortex (Sillito & Kemp, 1983; Sillito et al, 2006; Wang et al, 2006). The feedback from the visual cortex involves direct facilitatory input to the distal dendrites of the relay cells and facilitatory input to the TRN cells. Clearly all these processes will not have the same temporal signature and will be gated in different ways by different classes of visual stimuli. Here we explore the temporal evolution of the spatial properties of primate parvocellular LGN cells (assessed from the tonic response component, see Clements et al poster, this session) to drifting sinusoidal gratings of optimal spatial and temporal frequency.
Several things stand out from the data. The majority of the cells tested (13/21) gave their earliest response to larger than optimal stimuli and the final suppression pattern evolved after this. Only 5 cells showed the earliest response to the cells optimal diameter stimulus with fully developed patch suppression at the same time (cf Alitto & Usrey, 2008). Of particular interest was the fact that the response to the smallest less than optimal stimuli were never seen in the earliest time epochs and evolved later. We highlight this because we observed that these responses to small stimuli were selectively depressed by blockade of corticofugal feedback from cells in layer 6 of V1 with overlying receptive fields to the LGN cells tested. They would seem to depend on a modulatory influence from layer 6 which might be argued to enhance the resolution and focus of the LGN cells.},

This introduces the possibility of a re-entrant motion signal affecting the relay of the retinal input through the LGN to the visual cortex. The question is whether the response of LGN cells to moving stimuli involves a component derived from this feedback. By producing a reversible focal pharmacological block of the activity of an MT direction column we show the presence of such an influence from MT on the responses of magno, parvo and koniocellular cells in the macaque LGN. The pattern of effect in the LGN reflects the direction bias of the MT location inactivated. This suggests a moving stimulus is captured by iterative interactions in the circuit formed by visual cortical areas and visual thalamus.},

abstract = {It is well established that ongoing cognitive functions affect the trajectories of limb movements mediated by corticospinal circuits, suggesting an interaction between cognition and motor action. Although there are also many demonstrations that decision formation is reflected in the ongoing neural activity in oculomotor brain circuits, it is not known whether the decision-related activity in those oculomotor structures interacts with eye movements that are decision irrelevant. Here we tested for an interaction between decisions and instructed saccades unrelated to the perceptual decision. Observers performed a direction-discrimination decision-making task, but made decision-irrelevant saccades before registering their motion decision with a button press. Probing the oculomotor circuits with these decision-irrelevant saccades during decision making revealed that saccade reaction times and peak velocities were influenced in proportion to motion strength, and depended on the directional congruence between decisions about visual motion and decision-irrelevant saccades. These interactions disappeared when observers passively viewed the motion stimulus but still made the same instructed saccades, and when manual reaction times were measured instead of saccade reaction times, confirming that these interactions result from decision formation as opposed to visual stimulation, and are specific to the oculomotor system. Our results demonstrate that oculomotor function can be affected by decision formation, even when decisions are communicated without eye movements, and that this interaction has a directionally specific component. These results not only imply a continuous and interactive mixture of motor and decision signals in oculomotor structures, but also suggest nonmotor recruitment of oculomotor machinery in decision making.

These codes are characterized by highly specific, associative (i.e., dependent on combinations of features) and often invariant neuronal responses. Sparse representations present many advantages for memory storage and are, thus, of wide interest in sensory physiology. Here, we study the statistics of connectivity in an olfactory network that contributes to the generation of such codes: Kenyon cells (KCs), the intrinsic neurons of the mushroom body (a structure involved in learning and memory in insects) receive inputs from a small population of broadly tuned principal neurons; from these inputs, KCs generate exquisitely selective responses and, thus, sparse representations. We find, surprisingly, that KCs are on average each connected to about 50% of their input population. Simple analysis indicates that such connectivity indeed maximizes the difference between input vectors to KCs and helps to explain their high specificity.},

This demonstration is replicated, in principle, in the second experiment and we also show the timing of the V5-V1 interaction to correspond to findings from single unit physiology. In the third experiment we show that V1 is important for stimulus detection in visual search arrays and that the timing of V1 interference with TMS is late (up to 240 ms after the onset of the visual array). Finally we report an experiment showing that the parietal cortex is not involved in visual motion priming, whereas V5 is, suggesting that the parietal cortex does not modulate V5 in this task. We interpret the data in terms of Bullier’s recent physiological recordings and Ahissar and Hochstein’s reverse hierarchy theory of vision.},

abstract = {The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) serves as the primary conduit of retinal information to visual cortex. In addition to retinal input, dLGN receives a large feedback projection from layer VI of visual cortex. Such input modulates thalamic signal transmission in different ways that range from gain control to synchronizing network activity in a stimulus-specific manner. However, the mechanisms underlying such modulation have been difficult to study, in part because of the complex circuitry and diverse cell types this pathway innervates. To address this and overcome some of the technical limitations inherent in studying the corticothalamic (CT) pathway, we adopted a slice preparation in which we were able to stimulate CT terminal arbors in the visual thalamus of the mouse with blue light by using an adeno-associated virus to express the light-gated ion channel, ChIEF, in layer VI neurons. To examine the postsynaptic responses evoked by repetitive CT stimulation, we recorded from identified relay cells in dLGN, as well as GFP expressing GABAergic neurons in the thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) and intrinsic interneurons of dLGN. Relay neurons exhibited large glutamatergic responses that continued to increase in amplitude with each successive stimulus pulse. While excitatory responses were apparent at postnatal day 10, the strong facilitation noted in adult was not observed until postnatal day 21. GABAergic neurons in TRN exhibited large initial excitatory responses that quickly plateaued during repetitive stimulation, indicating that the degree of facilitation was much larger for relay cells than for TRN neurons. The responses of intrinsic interneurons were smaller and took the form of a slow depolarization. These differences in the pattern of excitation for different thalamic cell types should help provide a framework for understanding how CT feedback alters the activity of visual thalamic circuitry during sensory processing as well as different behavioral or pathophysiological states.},

Our current understanding of collective encoding of information and the relevant timescales is still limited. Most results are restricted to disparate timescales, focused on either very fast, e.g., spike-synchrony, or slow timescales, e.g., firing rate. Here, we investigated systematically multineuronal activity patterns evolving on different timescales, spanning the whole range from spike-synchrony to mean firing rate. Using multi-electrode recordings from cat visual cortex, we show that cortical responses can be described as trajectories in a high-dimensional pattern space. Patterns evolve on a continuum of coexisting timescales that strongly relate to the temporal properties of stimuli. Timescales consistent with the time constants of neuronal membranes and fast synaptic transmission (5-20 ms) play a particularly salient role in encoding a large amount of stimulus-related information. Thus, to faithfully encode the properties of visual stimuli the brain engages multiple neurons into activity patterns evolving on multiple timescales.},

abstract = {Processing of visual information in the brain seems to proceed from initial fast but coarse to subsequent detailed processing. Such coarse-to-fine changes appear also in the response of single neurons in the visual pathway. In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), there is a dynamic change in the receptive field (RF) properties of neurons during visual stimulation. During a stimulus flash centered on the RF, the width of the RF-center, presumably related to spatial resolution, changes rapidly from large to small in an initial transient response component. In a subsequent sustained component, the RF-center width is rather stable apart from an initial slight widening. Several brainstem nuclei modulate the geniculocortical transmission in a state-dependent manner. Thus, modulatory input from cholinergic neurons in the peribrachial brainstem region (PBR) enhances the geniculocortical transmission during arousal. We studied whether such input also influences the dynamic RF-changes during visual stimulation. We compared dynamic changes of RF-center width of dLGN neurons during brief stimulus presentation in a control condition, with changes during combined presentation of the visual stimulus and electrical PBR-stimulation. The major finding was that PBR-stimulation gave an advancement of the dynamic change of the RF-center width such that the different response components occurred earlier. Consistent with previous studies, we also found that PBR-stimulation increased the gain of firing rate during the sustained response component. However, this increase of gain was particularly strong in the transition from the transient to the sustained component at the time when the center width was minimal. The results suggest that increased modulatory PBR-input not only increase the gain of the geniculocortical transmission, but also contributes to faster dynamics of transmission. We discuss implications for possible effects on visual spatial resolution.},

These data suggest that the basic primate pattern of geniculate lamination consists of two parvocellular layers, two magnocellular layers, and two poorly developed and highly variable superficial (S) layers which are ventrally located. Ocular input to each member of each of the three pairs differs. In the macaque, the squirrel, and the saki monkey, the parvocellular layers subdivide and interdigitate into four leaflets so as to give the appearance of four parvocellular “layers.” These leaflets are much less extensive in the owl and marmoset monkeys. In some individual macaque monkeys, there is further splitting of the parvocellular leaflets into subleaflets, giving the appearance of six parvocellular “layers.” The prosimians (galago and slow loris) have two additional layers that are not found in pithecoid primates, and only one superficial layer is apparent. The two additional layers are termed “koniocellular” since they consist of very small cells. Finally, New and Old World monkeys have both ipsilateral and contralateral retinal input to the interlaminar zones. We conclude that the basic pattern of lateral geniculate organization is six layers, but not the traditional six. Prosimians have evolved two additional layers, the koniocellular layers, and have possibly lost one superficial layer. Both New World and Old World monkeys have elaborated the parvocellular layers by forming leaflets to varying extents. With the possible exception of the single S layer in prosimians, layers form pairs that are similar in cell types, but different in ocular input.},

Moreover, when subjects had to attend to one of two overlapping orthogonal gratings, feature-based attention strongly biased ensemble activity toward the attended orientation. These results demonstrate that fMRI activity patterns in early visual areas, including primary visual cortex (V1), contain detailed orientation information that can reliably predict subjective perception. Our approach provides a framework for the readout of fine-tuned representations in the human brain and their subjective contents.},

Interestingly, we also show that visual transients make it possible to detect a change in the eye of origin, despite the fact that observers have no clue as to which eye is stimulated. That is, visual transients are detected even when there is no perceptual change in the visual content after binocular fusion. More importantly, we show that observers cannot distinguish the transient due to a change in eye of origin from a feature change (the orientation of a Gabor). Both are perceived as actual changes. We conclude that a transient signal is sufficient for the visual system to judge whether something has changed over time.},

While underlying mechanisms may vary among them, a transient flash induced time-locked perceptual alternations in all cases. The effect showed a dependence on the adaptation to the dominant percept prior to the presentation of a flash.

This has led some to suggest that attention and awareness might be based on a common neural foundation, whereas others argue that they are mediated by distinct mechanisms. A body of evidence shows that visual stimuli can be processed at multiple stages of the visual-processing streams without evoking visual awareness. To illuminate the relationship between visual attention and conscious perception, we investigated whether top-down attention can target and modulate the neural representations of unconsciously processed visual stimuli. Our experiments show that spatial attention can target only consciously perceived stimuli, whereas feature-based attention can modulate the processing of invisible stimuli. The attentional modulation of unconscious signals implies that attention and awareness can be dissociated, challenging a simplistic view of the boundary between conscious and unconscious visual processing.},

This paper set the stage for the continuous flow of outstanding papers that emerged over the next twenty-odd years from the Hubel and Wiesel collaboration. Their work and that of Vernon Mountcastle opened up the modern study of the cerebral cortex. As a result of their extraordinary accomplishments, Hubel and Wiesel received the Gross Horwitz Prize together with Vernon Mountcastle in 1975, and the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1981 together with Roger Sperry.

It was on the occasion of the Gross Horwitz Prize, on whose committee I served, that I was invited to introduce Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel. My initial comments in that introduction were in fact directed toward an excellent scientist, a member of our Prize committee, who commented during our deliberations that Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel seemed to represent superb science, but their work had limited biological generality. To which I replied: ‘You are right, it does not apply to the kidney or the spleen. It is much more restricted. It only helps to explain the workings of the mind.’

Hubel and Wiesel’s names are enshrined together in the Pantheon of Creative Collaborations in Biological Sciences, much like Hodgkin and Huxley, Watson and Crick, and Brown and Goldstein. In each case, equal partners joined forces bringing unique skills to their collaboration to produce a new level of science and a new family of insights.

I first met Torsten and David in 1957, and we became friends in the period 1960–1965 when I overlapped with them at the Harvard Medical School. That friendship continues to this day, as does my admiration for the work, scientific and administrative, that they have accomplished since going their own directions in the early 1980s. In 1983 Torsten moved to New York, first as Professor and then in 1999 as President of Rockefeller University. I served on the Board of Trustees of the Rockefeller during much of Torsten’s tenure and this provided me with the additional opportunity to toast his 80th birthday.

What follows in the ensuing set of papers in this issue is an outpouring of affection, respect, and gratitude for Torsten and David, for who they are, for what they have given us, and for setting the tone of our science for my generation in the United States.

Introductory Comments on the Occasion of the Awarding of the Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize to Vernon Mountcastle, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel (Columbia University, Fall 1978)
President McGill, Vice President Marks, colleagues of Columbia University, honoured guests. Even the most important contributions, such as the work by Vernon Mountcastle, David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel that we honour tonight, have in addition to their obvious strengths, certain clear weaknesses. I will discuss the strengths in a moment, but I think it important at the outset to consider its weaknesses. Many contributions in biology inform us about general principles – principles that are important for understanding all the cells of the body. The contribution of Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel is concerned with only one class of cells – the cells of the brain. Their findings are therefore somewhat parochial. They are only important for understanding the mind.

Despite that limitation, the contributions of Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel are nonetheless rich in meaning and have significance for many levels of thought. Their work will, I would suggest, be discussed by historians of science from three quite different vantage points. First, it will be discussed from a purely scientific point of view, as a central contribution to neurobiology; second, from a broader philosophical point of view, as an enhancement of our understanding of mental processes; and third, from a sociological point of view, as an example of the importance of scientific lineage and of small group interactions at large universities.

First and foremost, as a scientific contribution to neurobiology, the work of Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel stands as the most fundamental advance in our understanding of the organization of the brain since the work of Ramón Y Cajal at the turn of the century. By applying morphological techniques to the cerebral cortex – the highest and most elaborate part of the brain – Cajal revealed a hitherto unanticipated precision of the interconnections between populations of individual nerve cells. Using modern cell physiological techniques, Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel have revealed aspects of the functional significance for perception of these patterns of interconnections between nerve cells. They have shown us that the connections filter and transform sensory information on the way to and within the cortex, that the cortex is organized into functional compartments or modules, and that this organization can be altered by experience. By any scientific criteria, these contributions are of the highest rank.

But on a second level, the work of Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel takes on greater significance because it contributes to our understanding of mental processes, a contribution with profound physiological implications. We appreciate important science because it tells us something new and exciting about the world around us. What is at once so special and so parochial about the work that we honour tonight is that it tells us something new and exciting about the world within us, about ourselves.

Let me give you an example. We have the feeling that when we interact with each other – when I speak to you and you listen to me – that we are directly experiencing one another. Hubel, Wiesel and Mountcastle have made us realize that this is an illusion, a perceptual illusion. The brain does not simply take the raw data that it receives through the senses and reproduce it faithfully in the brain. Rather, each sensory system first analyses and decomposes, and then restructures the incoming raw sensory information according to its own built-in connections and rules.

These insights are not only remarkable; they are also timely. Hints that similar processes may be involved in the development of language and thought are now emerging from the studies of structural psychologists such as Chomsky and Piaget.

On still a third level, the work of Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel is interesting because it illustrates in a unique manner the role of social context upon discovery and how small groups in a university can shape social contexts so as to make them conducive to creativity.

Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel are exceptionally creative, bright and energetic. Each would have made an important mark on science no matter where he worked. But I think it fair to say that the special nature of their contribution was fostered by the particular collegial environment to which they belonged.

They, in turn, have now restructured their environment anew so as to foster creative activity in their younger colleagues. Thus, in a certain sense, their work illustrates the role of intellectual continuity and intellectual renewal in the achievement of excellence by segments of two American universities, the Department of Physiology at Johns Hopkins and the Department of Neurobiology at Harvard.

Academic life is now often challenged, beleaguered, and fragmented. It is therefore inspiring – and more important, it is instructive – to learn which aspects of academic life are most conducive for the establishment of a powerful intellectual environment that is resistant both to external and administrative pressures – an environment that is at once sensitive to historical perspective while at the same time it encourages the emergence of novel and important ideas.

I would like to consider these three implications of Mountcastle’s contributions and those of Hubel and Wiesel – the scientific, the philosophical, and the sociological – by tracing the development of only one aspect of their contribution: the discovery of one of the central ideas in the functioning of the brain – the fact that the cerebral cortex is organized into computational modules consisting of vertical columns of nerve cells. That particular strand of research had its origins at Johns Hopkins Medical School in the mid-1930s.

Now, as you know, we experience the outside world through our five senses: touch-pressure (and the related skin or somatic sensation), sight, hearing, taste, and smell. Each sensation is first analysed by appropriate receptors and coded in lower relay stages. Most sensations are then elaborated in the cerebral cortex. Modern research on the role of the cerebral cortex in somatic sensation began in the Department of Physiology at Johns Hopkins Medical School in about 1936, with the work of Philip Bard and Clinton Woolsey.

Philip Bard was 34 years old and an Assistant Professor in Walter B. Cannon’s Department of Physiology at the Harvard Medical School when he was called to chair the Department of Physiology at Hopkins. Not only was he extraordinarily young at the time of this appointment but he had published only three original papers. He was the sort of person whose future one would worry about nowadays. Dean Tapley assures me that he would never pass our Appointments and Promotions Committee. In fact, Dean Tapley was surprised that he slipped by even at Hopkins.

Soon after coming to Hopkins, Bard teamed up with two even younger colleagues, Clinton Woolsey and Wade Marshall. Using gross electrophysiological recording techniques developed by Marshall and a strategy developed by Woolsey, these three young men discovered that the body surface of monkeys was systematically represented on the surface of the brain.

This was soon confirmed in humans by the Canadian neurosurgeon Wilder Penfield and established the fact that not only monkeys but each of us has within our brain a naked representation of our own body, the closest thing to our true self-image.

This remarkable discovery that animals and man have a representation of their body on the surface of their brain raised a number of conceptual problems. Somatic sensation is not unitary but a composite of several distinct sensations called submodalities. We can, for example, readily distinguish the pressure on deep tissue from the light touch on the skin. However, it appeared that the maps for these deep and superficial submodalities were completely congruent. Clearly with the relatively gross techniques used by Marshall, Woolsey and Bard – techniques that averaged the responses from thousands of nerve cells – some critical dimension in the map was overlooked.

After making this major contribution, Bard withdrew from the study of somatic sensation, leaving it to Woolsey and the younger members of his department who came along later.

The particular question of submodality perception was picked up in 1948 by Vernon Mountcastle, Bard’s most gifted student. Born in Virginia and educated at Johns Hopkins Medical School, Vernon Mountcastle was dissuaded from a career in Neurosurgery by Bard, who enticed him into Physiology.

I have always considered Mountcastle’s decision a great gain for Physiology, but having recently become familiar with the economics of neurosurgery, I am only now beginning to appreciate what a loss this decision has meant for Vernon Mountcastle. Over the years Mountcastle not only took over Bard’s fascination with skin sensation but also other aspects of Bard’s mantle. In 1946 when Bard retired Mountcastle assumed the directorship of the Department of Physiology. He also took on the editorship of Bard’s distinguished Textbook of Physiology.

Mountcastle realized early on that by using the cellular techniques that became available in the late 1940s he might be able to detect new dimensions in the map of the somatic sensory system that eluded the gross recording techniques used by Bard and his colleagues. This task required a number of major technical innovations including new microelectrodes and precise quantifiable natural stimuli – innovations to which Mountcastle contributed importantly.

With these tools in hand – tools that formed the basis of modern cortical physiology – Mountcastle addressed the question of submodality specificity. He found that at the cellular level, there is within all areas of the somatic sensory system a segregation of submodalities that was not resolved with gross recordings.

First, he found that single nerve cells respond specifically either to superficial touch stimuli or to deep pressure stimuli, almost never to both.

Second, he found that cells responding to one submodality were located together and were segregated from cells responding to other submodalities. The most fascinating example of segregation is found in the cortex. In a classical paper published in 1957, Mountcastle described his remarkable discovery that submodalities were distributed in the cortex as vertical columns running from the surface of the brain to the white matter below it. Each column is submodality-specific. All the cells in a column receive information from a particular point on the skin and from a particular class of receptors, either superficial or deep. Thus, each region of the skin projects to a particular area of the cortex, and the separate receptor classes are distributed in adjacent columns. The distribution of neurons in columns is therefore the mechanism whereby the depth of the cortex is used to handle different functions for the same small region of the bodily map. Each column is an integrating unit, or logical module, comprising thousands of neurons that form the initial stage in the cortex for elaborating sensory experience into consciousness.

In order to follow the history of the discovery of columnar organization, I will now describe the numerous other contributions that have subsequently come from Vernon Mountcastle. These include the analysis of the flow of information from skin to the cerebral cortex, a correlation between cellular responses and perception, and recently a study of the mechanisms underlying attention and the control of purposeful movements.

In the 40 years that have passed since Bard, Woolsey and Marshall first mapped the representation of the body surface onto the brain, the Department of Physiology at Johns Hopkins, first under Bard and subsequently under Mountcastle, has been preeminent for research training in skin senses. As a result of Mountcastle’s recent work, this preeminence has now been extended to the study of attention and behaviour.

Indeed as a result of the leadership of Bard, Woolsey and Mountcastle, Hopkins was for many years so outstanding in the study of sensation that it also dominated research in hearing and in vision.

For example, while he was still at Hopkins, Wade Marshall, who had already contributed importantly to the early study of skin sensation, teamed up with Samuel Talbot to demonstrate that the cortex also contains detailed maps of the retina. About 10 years later, in 1948, a young man, Stephen Kuffler – whom I am delighted to see here tonight – was recruited to the Wilmer Eye Institute at Hopkins. Upon arriving, Kuffler turned his attention from synaptic transmission to cellular studies of the retina, an area to which he immediately made fundamental contributions.

In 1955 Kuffler was joined by Torsten Wiesel, a young postdoctoral fellow from Sweden. Wiesel had experience in child psychiatry and a particular interest in vision. Three years later, David Hubel joined Torsten Wiesel in Kuffler’s laboratory. Born in Canada, Hubel took his residency in Neurology at Hopkins where he met Vernon Mountcastle.

He then spent two years at Walter Reed working on vision when Mountcastle recruited him back to his laboratory at Hopkins. However, when Hubel arrived Mountcastle’s laboratory was in the process of being renovated. Hubel therefore accepted a temporary invitation to work in Kuffler’s lab. He turned out to be a guest who stayed for more than dinner.

Confronted with two gifted young investigators each interested in vision, Kuffler set Wiesel and Hubel to work together in vision and went off on his own in a new direction. The largely accidental meeting of Wiesel and Hubel in Kuffler’s laboratory in 1958 gave rise to what has been one of the most remarkable, sustained and productive collaborations in contemporary science. Although each has occasionally worked with another collaborator, almost all of their fundamental contributions have involved simply the two of them.

Soon after the beginning of their collaboration, Kuffler was invited to join the Department of Pharmacology at the Harvard Medical School to head a small laboratory of Neurophysiology. A true pater familias, Kuffler took with him the four young faculty people then working independently in his laboratory. Hubel and Wiesel, the two ‘brain boys’ as they were called, and Furshpan and Potter, the two ‘membrane boys.’ They were soon joined by a fifth colleague, an enzymologist, Ed Kravitz, whose function it presumably was to explain it all in the universal language of biochemistry.

Harvard responded to Kuffler’s brilliant recruitment effort in a typical manner – it immediately demoted Hubel and Wiesel from the Assistant Professorships they held at Johns Hopkins to a non-professional rank. This was of course only to be expected from a university that had within recent years successfully denied tenure to two Nobel laureates, Georg Von Bekesey and Fritz Lipmann.

But Harvard found its match in Kuffler and his boys. Unlike Bard who devoted much time to administration in his later career, Kuffler was and still is the bench scientist’s bench scientist. Nonetheless over a 10 year period, in his own quiet way, Kuffler turned the laboratory of Neurophysiology at Harvard, consisting of one professor and five postdoctoral fellows, into a Department of Neurobiology, the first in the country – 100 persons strong. A veritable intellectual dynasty, the department now occupies, as far as I can tell, about half of the available space at the Harvard Medical School. And you cannot open a door in all that space without some energetic, enthusiastic and aggressive young student coming out to criticize your every idea and replacing it with one of his own. Much of what we now consider modern neurobiology – the fusion of disparate scientific strands into one – was born out of Hopkins’s gift to Harvard. You only have to visit the Harvard department to see why. As with Bard’s department at Hopkins, so in Harvard’s Department of Neurobiology, the world belongs to the young.

While still at Hopkins, Hubel and Wiesel began to apply cellular techniques to the visual cortex. Kuffler had earlier recorded from single cells in the retina and made the surprising discovery that the cells do not simply signal absolute levels of light; rather, they signal contrast between light and dark. The most effective stimulus for exciting these cells was not diffuse light but small spots of light. Hubel and Wiesel found a similar principle operating in the next relay stage, the lateral geniculate nucleus. However, at the level of the cortex, Hubel and Wiesel found that most cells no longer responded to small spots of light. To be effective, a stimulus had to be a line, a square, or a rectangle.

Thus Hubel and Wiesel found that these cortical cells did not simply and faithfully reproduce the input from the lateral geniculate nucleus but, by virtue of their connections, the cortical cells were able to abstract linear aspects of the stimulus. The stimulus requirements of the cortical cells are amazingly precise. In addition to requiring linearity, each cell is coded to respond to a specific axis of orientation; some cells respond best when the axis of the line stimulus is running vertically, others when the axis is horizontal, still other cells respond only to various oblique angles. Every small segment of the retina is represented in the cortex with every angle or orientation. It is attractive to think that these cells are the early building blocks in the perception of form and contour.

Hubel and Wiesel next found that cells with similar axes of orientation were grouped together into columns similar to those which Mountcastle had found in the somatosensory system. Now Hubel and Wiesel have profoundly original minds. To confirm someone else’s work is anathema to them. They are most happy writing papers where all the references are only to their own work – a happiness they have somehow sustained with surprising regularity. Upon finding columns, they quickly proceeded to extend our insight into the nature of columnar organization. First, they predicted and found another completely independent system of columns in the cortex – the ocular dominance columns – a system concerned with information from the two eyes. These columns serve to elaborate binocular vision necessary for depth perception. Second, they utilized a variety of morphological techniques to visualize the columns in three-dimensional space. The early work of Mountcastle, and of Hubel and Wiesel described columnar organization strictly on the basis of electrical recordings from single cells. Routine histological examination had failed to reveal columnar organization. However, capitalizing on the current revolution in morphological techniques – a revolution that is based upon the use of marker substances that label cells according to one or another aspect of their functional activity – Hubel and Wiesel could independently label both the ocular dominance columns and their orientation columns. The results they have obtained with these methods are not only aesthetically breathtaking but have given us a completely new sense of the organization of the cortex – an insight made possible only by moving beyond the range of traditional anatomical approaches.

Thus, they have made us realize that we are just beginning to explore the structural organization of the brain and its possible alterations by disease. No wonder we have so little understanding of the biological basis of most forms of mental illness.

Finally, Wiesel and Hubel have used these studies of the normal columnar organization to investigate the effects of sensory deprivation on newborn animals. They found that a fairly subtle procedure such as closing the eyelids of a newborn monkey for just a few days leads to prolonged and sometimes irreversible blindness. Concomitantly, the closed eye loses its ability to control the firing of nerve cells in the cortex. By contrast, similar experiences in an adult animal produce no effect on vision. In a brilliant series of studies, Wiesel and Hubel found that visual deprivation in infant monkeys profoundly alters the organization of their ocular dominance columns. Normally the columns for each eye are equal in size. After deprivation, the columns that receive input for the deprived eye are much narrowed compared to those that receive input from the normal eye.

The scientific and philosophical implication of this work is truly enormous. Here is direct evidence that sensory deprivation in early life can alter the structure of the cortex. As Hubel pointed out in his Bowditch Lecture of 1967:

Experimental psychologists and psychiatrists both emphasize the importance of early experience on subsequent behaviour patterns – could it be that deprivation of social contacts or the existence of other abnormal emotional situations early in life leads to a deterioration or distortion of connections in some yet unexplored parts of the brain.

The columns were first discovered by Mountcastle in the somatic sensory system and their functional properties and their alteration by experience were analysed by Hubel and Wiesel in the visual system. More recently, columns, stripes, sheets and other types of functional modules have been encountered in other areas of the cortex and in yet other regions of the brain. Here these modules are related to other forms of sensation as well as to motor control. It is clear that we are dealing here with one of the key principles in the organization of the cortex and the cornerstone for future work on the brain.

In closing, I would like to return to the question of social context. I have already drawn analogies between the social values and attitudes of Bard and Kuffler and the resulting flowering of scientific creativity in Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel, who in turn have now created environments where others can be independent and creative.

Moreover, much as Mountcastle, Wiesel and Hubel sit here tonight to receive the same honour that this University bestowed on Kuffler six years ago, I am confident that this University will in the future honour the intellectual descendants of Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel.

By drawing this analogy, I do not mean to imply that these five distinctive and unconventional people – Bard, Kuffler, Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel – are cut from one mould. But I do want to indicate that they share two rare qualities that are often overlooked in considering why gifted scientists often train other exceptional scientists. This is a question that has now been examined by a number of sociologists, most prominently by our colleagues at Columbia, Professors Merton and Zuckerman. They have pointed out that good scientists can teach their junior colleagues the importance of working on really significant problems; they also offer resources and visibility, and make available to their students important channels of communication. All of these qualities, however, are in line with the direct expression of a senior person’s own ambition, of his own desire for growth.

What is evident in the three men whom we honour tonight and in their scientific patrons are two features that are much rarer, much more special.

One is the ability to rein in their own ambition and to encourage without reservation the creativity of their gifted young colleagues.

The second feature is the ability to build around them an exciting environment made up of gifted peers, an environment where important science is routinely done because the environment is consciously structured around one or more absolutely central ideas. The resultant internal cohesion has the additional consequence that it buffers the environment from disturbing vicissitudes of academic and scientific life.

Both of these features derive, I believe, from the ability of these rare scientists to combine a remarkable intuition of what is important in their field with an almost childlike enjoyment of the day-to-day experimental and intellectual activity of science. They enjoy day-to-day science as a satisfying end in itself, an ever-changing intellectual adventure – a repertory theatre of ideas.

It is for these reasons that the Columbia community takes such special pleasure in honouring Mountcastle, Hubel and Wiesel. For their contribution to the biology of the brain – the most remarkable and profound of our generation – represents at once scientific and personal qualities at their highest. In honouring them, we are drawing attention to the excitement in learning and the respect of colleagueship that drew so many of us to academic life. Their contribution gives us not only an insight into the brain and into ourselves but it also gives us specific examples of how the best in personal and academic values can be achieved and sustained over generations.

Torsten Wiesel: an ever-evolving, self-reinventing post-modern Faustian intellectual
(From An Introduction to Torsten Wiesel’s 80th Birthday Celebration, Rockefeller University, June 3, 2004)

I have the pleasure to serve as the after-dinner toastmaster for Torsten’s 80th birthday celebration. Let me introduce things with an overview of Torsten’s life and work. I will divide my comments in three parts. First, I will describe Torsten’s scientific accomplishments and his style of leadership. Second, I will try to develop a theory of Torsten Wiesel’s life and work based on a fundamental typology that distinguishes between different classes of scholars and scientists. Finally, I am going to outline some limitations to Torsten’s greatness.

I begin with a description of Torsten’s life and times.

Torsten was born in 1924 in Uppsala, Sweden, the son of a prominent psychiatrist who served consecutively as superintendent of two large psychiatric hospitals. One of the perks of being superintendent was a residence on the property, so Torsten spent most of his early years on the grounds of a mental hospital surrounded by mental patients.

In retrospect, it was probably this extensive experience with the institutionalized mentally ill that allowed him to function so effectively as president of Rockefeller University in the aftermath of David Baltimore’s resignation.

I am here reminded of the story told by Douglas Bond, the great American psychiatrist who rose to become Dean of the Medical School at Western Reserve. A friend once asked him: ‘Doug, I don’t understand how you could take on an administrative job and give up seeing patients, which you always so enjoy doing.’‘I haven’t given up seeing patients,’ insisted Bond. ‘I still see patients. It’s just that now, my patients have tenure!’

In 1945, at age 21, Torsten entered the Karolinska Institute to begin medical training. At the Karolinska he particularly enjoyed the lectures on the brain by Ulf von Euler, the discoverer of noradrenaline, and by Carl Gustaf Bernhard, who worked on epilepsy. Bernhard went on to become Torsten’s great mentor and friend.

During his last year of medical training, Torsten worked first in adult and later in child psychiatry. But by the end of that year he decided that the available treatments did not satisfy him. So he turned to the biology of the brain and in 1954 joined Bernhard’s department of neurophysiology at the Karolinska Institute as an instructor.

One year later, in June of 1955, Bernhard asked him whether he might want to go to the United States to work on the retina as a postdoctoral fellow with Steven Kuffler at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns Hopkins. That was a major turning point in Torsten’s ever-evolving career. Steve Kuffler, as you all know, proved to be an enormous influence on Torsten.

In 1957, Torsten and Steve attended a Symposium on Vision at the NIH that I also attended. At that symposium, David Hubel gave a talk on simultaneous recovery of the activity of the response of two cells from the visual cortex – area 17 – in intact freely moving cats. Hubel noticed that when he moved his hand in one direction – to the left – in front of the awake animal’s eye, one of the two cells in the striate cortex would fire vigorously whereas the other was inhibited, but if he moved his hand in the opposite direction, the cells that had fired in the hand movement to the left were inhibited whereas the cell that was previously inhibited now fired vigorously. This directional selectivity of the response was the first complex property to be noted in the mammalian visual system. From that talk by David, it was clear to both Torsten and Steve that the striate cortex was likely to be much more interesting than the retina. So the question was how to get David to the Wilmer Eye Institute.

This was no simple task. David had just accepted an appointment in the Physiology Department at Hopkins from Vernon Mountcastle. But as fortune would have it, when David arrived at Hopkins in 1958, the laboratories in Physiology that were designed for him were not yet ready. So where was David to go? In stepped Steven Kuffler to the rescue. He invited David to the Wilmer Eye Institute and suggested that David collaborate with Torsten.

Together Torsten and David decided to record from anaesthetized cats rather than from awake animals and to do a systematic study of the receptive field properties of cortical neurons. The rest is well known to all of us. There followed the Wiesel-Hubel era – 20 uninterrupted years of extraordinary science. David and Torsten did more than open up the study of the primary visual cortex, they laid the basis for what was to follow in all sensory systems. They delineated the properties and the hierarchical organization of simple and complex cells, they discovered a columnar organization for both orientation and ocular dominance, and culminated their work in the remarkable finding of plasticity in the ocular dominance columns during a critical period of development. These cellular physiological contributions were made all the more compelling by beautiful and insightful anatomical verification. Together this body of work stands as one of the great biological achievements of the twentieth century. But it was not simply their work but also the style that was so great: a combination of insight, creativity, beauty and modesty.

I give but two examples of their modesty. Torsten and David asked me to read their 1965 paper on ‘Binocular Interactions in Striate Cortex of Kittens Reared with Artificial Squint’ before submitting it to the Journal of Neurophysiology. I found it to be very important, and suggested, among other things, that since the findings were so critical, perhaps they should base it on more than one animal, one cat. They agreed and did a second cat. Second, I suggested that having 10 of the 12 references in the bibliography to their own work seemed a bit inappropriate. They also agreed and removed the two references to other people’s work!

During the classic period of the Hubel–Wiesel collaboration, Torsten was seen by most people as a scientist who combined creativity with extremely high scientific standards. But none of us, including David, who knew him best, saw in Torsten great leadership potential. Most of us saw Torsten as modest, slightly shy, and not disposed to giving David Hubel-like bravura lectures.

However, in 1973, all that changed. That year Steve Kuffler decided to step down as the chair of the Harvard Department of Neurobiology. At first thought, one might reflexively turn to David to replace Steve. But by 1973, it was clear that this was not to be.

It so happens that a few years earlier, David had established the record for the shortest tenure as a departmental chair in the history of Harvard University, a history going back to 1636! In 1967 David had accepted the chairmanship of the Physiology Department. He began his term by ignoring the complaints of the most senior professor in the department that the pencil sharpeners in the physiology office never functioned properly and that they should install a new one. In response to this one complaint, David stopped returning telephone calls from other members of the physiology department, missed faculty meetings, and made no move to transfer his laboratory to physiology. Nevertheless, between his experiments with Torsten, his astronomy, his lessons in Japanese and on the flute, David did manage to free up the time to lobby for and obtain tenure in Physiology for two of his best friends. Having accomplished this one task in his first six months on the job, David decided that he had done enough for Physiology at Harvard. He therefore resigned the chairmanship and returned to the neurobiology department which he had actually never left. Thus, when looking for a leader who might actually spend time on the job, David’s name did not immediately spring to mind.

Torsten, on the other hand, had all along been concerned about young faculty members, about postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, and took on the chairmanship of neurobiology with vigour and imagination. This startled us all! A new Torsten was emerging. Torsten proved an outstanding chairman and a powerfully influential force as leader of the medical school. Behind that quiet façade there proved to be a man of steel!

During that period, David and Torsten began to move their separate ways scientifically. David began to collaborate with Marge Livingston on visual illusions and on the parallel processing of the visual image. Torsten started to collaborate with Charles Gilbert on how the cells of a cortical column are wired together. This quiet beginning led to the unanticipated discovery of the horizontal connections in the visual system – a major contribution to the functioning of the striate cortex that Charles now continues to carry forward.

In 1983 Torsten accepted an invitation from Rockefeller University to head a new laboratory there. Nine years later, in 1991, when David Baltimore resigned, Torsten as head of the faculty and now a mere 671/2 years of age, was asked by the Trustees to serve as president of Rockefeller University. Over the next six years he did an amazing job. He responded to the demoralized state of the faculty by energizing them with his optimistic view of the future. He brought to bear on this job his characteristic sense of decency, his humour, modesty, informality and intelligence. Over tea and cookies he met with the faculty individually and in groups and achieved consensus to recruit outstanding new scientists. I mention only Jim Hudspeth and Rod McKinnon in neurobiology to give you a sense of his taste and his accomplishments. He turned the fiscal problems of the university around and left in 1998 with the university rejuvenated and in superb shape. Since that time Torsten has continued to serve Rockefeller as director of the Shelby White and Leon Levy Center for Mind, Brain, and Behavior. In this capacity he has continued to exercise his taste and talent in recruitment, by convincing Cori Bargmann, who is here tonight, to move to Rockefeller as the new major star in neural science.

But, in a larger sense Torsten has turned from the provincialism of Rockefeller University and the City of New York to assume responsibility for science throughout the world. Torsten chairs the Latin American Fellows Program of the Pew Charitable Trust that supports training for postdoctoral students in the United States before their return home with requisite funding to set up their own labs.

He serves as chair of the Committee of Human Rights of the National Academy of Sciences which assists scholars who have been harassed for asserting their right to free speech.

Torsten is Chairman and President of IBRO – the International Brain Research Organization – and since 2000 has been the Secretary General of the Human Frontier Science Program. That program was moribund until Torsten revamped it by initiating exciting new international collaborations and by encouraging the training of postdoctoral fellows in outstanding laboratories throughout the world.

In addition to his scientific accomplishments, his leadership of institutions and international organizations, Torsten is a co-publisher with Jean Stein of the magazine Grand Street, and, as you will learn, he is an art collector par excellence with broad tastes and interests. Some of you may recall the one-person show at the Pace Gallery where Torsten’s personal collection was on view, a collection united not by adherence to a single school of art or period in art history but by the unity of vision of its collector.

How then, in the perspective of his 80 years and all that is still ahead of him, can we do justice to Torsten? How can we frame his contributions against the history of Western thought and in the context of Western academic leadership? How can we describe his style so that it can serve as a model for our students? Into what sort of leadership typology does Torsten naturally belong?

Clearly, Torsten is a European intellectual by nature and a northern European by temperament. One is tempted therefore to turn for guidance to the great northern European writers and thinkers – to Ibsen, Strindberg, Dinesen, Goethe, and Nietzsche. Of these, only Nietzsche and Goethe are helpful because only they have developed useful typologies for people of thought as well as people of action.

Nietzsche, whom I turn to first, divided thinkers and people of action into two types: Apollonian and Dionysian. The Apollonian leader is rational, intellectual, fair-minded, above the fray; the Dionysian is sensual, instinctive, volatile, creative. Torsten does not fit exclusively into one or the other of these two categories for he possesses parts of both. In many ways he is Apollonian. But anyone who has watched him enjoy a glass of wine or observed him on the dance floor knows he is also a sensualist to the core.

Goethe perhaps offers a more appropriate typology, one that distinguishes two broad subtypes: the self-satisfied and fully evolved intellectual and the never quite satisfied, ever-evolving intellectual. The satisfied scholar pauses when he reaches a plateau of accomplishment to enjoy his achievement and then proceeds further along the same path seeking more of the same knowledge or assuming a modest leadership role. Torsten clearly belongs to the other subtype. He is an ever-evolving, self-re-inventing intellectual who strives for more than knowledge, he strives for new ways of living not simply for himself but for the academic community and in the limit for the betterment of humankind.

In his search for new experiences in the service of humankind, Torsten is much like Goethe’s reinvention of Marlowe’s Faust, an intellectual who re-invents himself repeatedly. What Goethe’s Faust most wants is knowledge beyond books; he seeks not simply sensual but intellectual adventure, and service on behalf of humankind. Simply to remind you, Faust bases his bet with Mephistopheles, which he wins, on the following premise:

If ever I lie down on a bed of ease, then let that be my final end: if you can flatter me with lies into a self-complacency; let that be the last day for me!

Much like a modern Faust, Torsten’s life has been a life of self-education and continued development in his search for ways to improve science first in his own laboratory, in his collaborations with David and Charles, then in the leadership of his department at Harvard, later as president of his university at Rockefeller, and now in his leadership of the scientific community throughout the world.

But on a path where risks are taken, there is always the risk of failure. So it will not surprise you to learn that Torsten’s striving does not invariably succeed. Let me give you one example. Torsten and I independently fell in love with the paintings of an Israeli minimalist artist, Moshe Kupferman, who had escaped the Warsaw ghetto and emigrated to Israel where he spent the rest of his career in a kibbutz appropriately called The Fighters of the Ghetto.

In 1999 Torsten and I visited him in his modest studio at that kibbutz where he said to us with tears in his eyes, ‘I dream – and I am getting too old to dream – that I can someday have a retrospective exhibition at a museum in New York.’ Torsten and I turned to each other knowingly. We each thought that between the two of us and our friends we could certainly arrange that. We formed an influential committee and began at the top by first soliciting the Metropolitan Museum and then worked our way down. Everyone recognized Kupferman and thought him superb. But we were turned down time and time again. No one thought that his work would produce a blockbuster exhibit.

At last, in desperation we turned to the Jewish Museum. How could they refuse us! But they also had no difficulty in doing so. Kupferman is very good, they said. In fact, we have two of his paintings! But he lacks one characteristic. He is not Jewish enough. Not Jewish enough for the Jewish Museum! So you see – there are real limits even to Torsten’s strivings.

Let me conclude these thoughts by asking: Where is this post-Faustian northern European intellectual heading in the future? Where is he leading us next? Clearly, the next step for Torsten is to combine his interest in art, science and leadership. So I propose we nominate Torsten to succeed Philip de Montebello, who, exhausted at age 60, is rumoured to be retiring soon from his directorship of the Metropolitan Museum. Having Torsten as head of the Metropolitan Museum will accomplish two purposes. First, it will give Torsten a new platform from which to combine his ideas about education and his love of art, with his interest in the biology of perception, and the nature of the aesthetic experience. In addition, it will give all of us another opportunity at a Kupferman retrospective exhibit.

Finally, although this is a celebration of Torsten, no celebration of Torsten is complete without a celebration of Jean Stein who during the last 25 years has heightened Torsten’s and all our lives by sharing with us her deep insights into contemporary art, photography, and poetry. To continue the Goethean metaphor, Jean is the eternal feminine – Das ewig Weibliche – that inspires us all to perfection. Her taste, intelligence, and progressive vision has been a central component of all of our aspirations.

So let me raise a glass to Torsten on his birthday. Torsten, you are a friend and colleague of inestimable value. We who celebrate you today admire you fondly as a remarkable person, an extraordinary scientist, and a superb democratic leader with a sense of decency and style. And, since at age 80 you act, think and strive as a person half your age, we wish you and Jean another 80 years together, 80 more years of striving, reinventing, and pleasure. Torsten, Skoal!},

Here we determine the shortest delay times required for figure-ground segregation based on purely temporal features. Previous studies usually employed stimulus onset asynchronies between figure and ground-containing possible artefacts based on apparent motion cues or on luminance differences. Our stimuli systematically avoid these artefacts by constantly showing 20 x 20 `colons’ that flip by 90 0 around their midpoints at constant time intervals. Colons constituting the background flip in-phase whereas those constituting the target flip with a phase delay. We tested the impact of frequency modulation and phase reduction on target detection. Younger subjects performed well above chance even at temporal delays as short as 13 ms, whilst older subjects required up to three times longer delays in some conditions. Figure-ground segregation can rely on purely temporal delays down to around 10 ms even in the absence of luminance and motion artefacts, indicating a temporal precision of cortical information processing almost an order of magnitude lower than the one required for some models of feature binding in the visual cortex [e.g. Singer, W. (1999), Curr. Opin. Neurobiol., 9, 1891194]. Hence, in our experiment, observers are unable to use temporal stimulus features with the precision required for these models},

This negative potential has a peak latency of about 200-300 ms and a peak amplitude of about -3 to -10 microV [Doc Ophthalmol. 95 (1998) 335]. Previously, we demonstrated that human subjects reliably segregate figure from ground, even in the absence of the classical cues, leaving time of change as the only cue for segregation. The results of the present study demonstrate that also purely temporally defined checkerboards evoke a tsVEP resembling the motion-defined tsVEP regarding polarity (negative), latency (two peaks at 180 and 270 ms, respectively), amplitude of the first negativity (-5.6 microV), and overall form of its components.},

abstract = {Figure-ground segregation can rely on purely temporal information, that is, on short temporal delays between positional changes of elements in figure and ground (Kandil, F.I. & Fahle, M. (2001) Eur. J. Neurosci., 13, 2004-2008). Here, we investigate the underlying mechanisms by measuring temporal segregation thresholds for various kinds of motion cues. Segregation can rely on monocular first-order motion (based on luminance modulation) and second-order motion cues (contrast modulation) with a high temporal resolution of approximately 20 ms. The mechanism can also use isoluminant motion with a reduced temporal resolution of 60 ms. Figure-ground segregation can be achieved even at presentation frequencies too high for human subjects to inspect successive frames individually. In contrast, when stimuli are presented dichoptically, i.e. separately to both eyes, subjects are unable to perceive any segregation, irrespective of temporal frequency. We propose that segregation in these displays is detected by a mechanism consisting of at least two stages. On the first level, standard motion or flicker detectors signal local positional changes (flips). On the second level, a segregation mechanism combines the local activities of the low-level detectors with high temporal precision. Our findings suggest that the segregation mechanism can rely on monocular detectors but not on binocular mechanisms. Moreover, the results oppose the idea that segregation in these displays is achieved by motion detectors of a higher order (motion-from-motion), but favour mechanisms sensitive to short temporal delays even without activation of higher-order motion detectors.},

Lee and Blake (1999) [Visual form created solely from temporal structure. Science, 284, 1165-1168] demonstrated that this figure-ground separation may be based not only on time differences between motion onsets, but also on the differences between reversals of motion direction. However, Farid and Adelson (2001) [Synchrony does not promote grouping in temporally structured displays. Nature Neuroscience, 4, 875-876] argued that figure-ground segregation in the motion-reversal experiment might have been based on a contrast artefact and concluded that (a)synchrony as such was ‘not responsible for the perception of form in these or earlier displays’. Here, we present experiments that avoid contrast artefacts but still produce figure-ground segregation based on purely temporal cues. Our results show that subjects can segregate figure from ground even though being unable to use motion reversals as such. Subjects detect the figure when either (i) motion stops (leading to contrast artefacts), or (ii) motion directions differ between figure and ground. Segregation requires minimum delays of about 15 ms. We argue that whatever the underlying cues and mechanisms, a second stage beyond motion detection is required to globally compare the outputs of local motion detectors and to segregate figure from ground. Since analogous changes take place in both figure and ground in rapid succession, this second stage has to detect the asynchrony with high temporal precision.},

The interpolation process requires registration of the form slices, as well as perception of the shape’s global motion, in order to reassemble the slices in the correct order. The commonly proposed mechanism is a spatio-temporal motion detector with a receptive field, for which spatial distance and temporal delays are interchangeable, and which has generally been regarded as monocular. Here we investigate separately the nature of the motion and the form detection involved in spatio-temporal interpolation, using dichoptic masking and interocular presentation tasks. The results clearly demonstrate that the associated mechanisms for both motion and form are binocular rather than monocular. Hence, we question the traditional view according to which spatio-temporal interpolation is achieved by monocular first-order motion-energy detectors in favour of models featuring binocular motion and form detection.},

abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Smooth pursuit eye movements are compromised in patients with schizophrenia and their first-degree relatives. Although research has demonstrated that the motor components of smooth pursuit eye movements are intact, motion perception has been shown to be impaired. In particular, studies have consistently revealed deficits in performance on tasks specific to the high-order motion area V5 (middle temporal area, MT) in patients with schizophrenia. In contrast, data from low-level motion detectors in the primary visual cortex (V1) have been inconsistent. METHOD: To differentiate between low-level and high-level visual motion processing, we applied a temporal-order judgment task for motion events and a motion-defined figure-ground segregation task using patients with schizophrenia and healthy controls. Successful judgments in both tasks rely on the same low-level motion detectors in the V1; however, the first task is further processed in the higher-order motion area MT in the magnocellular (dorsal) pathway, whereas the second task requires subsequent computations in the parvocellular (ventral) pathway in visual area V4 and the inferotemporal cortex (IT). These latter structures are supposed to be intact in schizophrenia. RESULTS: Patients with schizophrenia revealed a significantly impaired temporal resolution on the motion-based temporal-order judgment task but only mild impairment in the motion-based segregation task. CONCLUSIONS: These results imply that low-level motion detection in V1 is not, or is only slightly, compromised; furthermore, our data restrain the locus of the well-known deficit in motion detection to areas beyond the primary visual cortex.},

To investigate how local neural activity is integrated in the computation of global motion, we asked observers to judge the direction of a rigidly translating natural scene viewed through 16 apertures. We report a novel relative oblique effect: local contour orientations parallel or orthogonal to the direction of motion yield more precise and less biased estimates of direction than other orientations. This effect varies inversely with the local orientation variance of the natural scenes. Analysis of contour orientations across aperture pairings extends previous research on plaids and indicates that observers are biased toward the faster moving contour for Type I pairings. Finally, we show that observers’ bias and precision as a function of the orientation statistics of natural scenes can be accounted for by an interaction between naturally arising anisotropies in natural scenes and a template model of MT that is optimally tuned for isotropic stimuli.},

Here, we studied how the different tuning features affect the performance of these cells in discriminating between stimuli with different orientations. Previous studies of the orientation discrimination power of neurons in V1 focused on resolving two nearby orientations close to the psychophysical threshold of orientation discrimination. Here, we developed a theoretical framework, the information tuning curve, that measures the discrimination power of cells as a function of the orientation difference, deltatheta, of the two stimuli. This tuning curve also represents the mutual information between the neuronal responses and the stimulus orientation. We studied theoretically the dependence of the information tuning curve on the orientation tuning width, baseline, and peak responses. Of main interest is the finding that narrow orientation tuning is not necessarily optimal for all angular discrimination tasks. Instead, the optimal tuning width depends linearly on deltatheta. We applied our theory to study the discrimination performance of a population of 490 neurons in macaque V1. We found that a significant fraction of the neuronal population exhibits favorable tuning properties for large deltatheta. We also studied how the discrimination capability of neurons is distributed and compared several other measures of the orientation tuning such as CV with Chernoff distances for normalized tuning curves.},

Such information can be substantially reduced by correlated trial-to-trial variability. Noise correlations have been measured across a wide range of areas in the brain, but their origin is still far from clear. Here we show analytically and with simulations that optimal computation on inputs with limited information creates patterns of noise correlations that account for a broad range of experimental observations while at same time causing information to saturate in large neural populations. With the example of a network of V1 neurons extracting orientation from a noisy image, we illustrate to our knowledge the first generative model of noise correlations that is consistent both with neurophysiology and with behavioral thresholds, without invoking suboptimal encoding or decoding or internal sources of variability such as stochastic network dynamics or cortical state fluctuations. We further show that when information is limited at the input, both suboptimal connectivity and internal fluctuations could similarly reduce the asymptotic information, but they have qualitatively different effects on correlations leading to specific experimental predictions. Our study indicates that noise at the sensory periphery could have a major effect on cortical representations in widely studied discrimination tasks. It also provides an analytical framework to understand the functional relevance of different sources of experimentally measured correlations.},

Surprisingly, we found that even the most conventional measures of receptive field (RF) size were not fixed, but could vary depending on stimulus contrast and foreground-background relationships. On average, the length of the excitatory RF was 4-fold greater for a low-contrast stimulus than for a stimulus at high contrast. Embedding a high-contrast stimulus in a textured background tended to suppress neuronal responses and produced an enlargement in RF size similar to that observed by decreasing the contrast of an isolated stimulus. The results show that RF dimensions are regulated in a dynamic manner that depends both on local stimulus characteristics, such as contrast, and on global relationships between a stimulus and its surroundings.},

Recordings from V1 showed that 42% of complex cells demonstrated facilitation for a second bar outside their classical receptive fields with a similar dependency on relative location and orientation. Both effects were eliminated by an orthogonal line between the two iso-oriented lines. Multiple randomly placed and oriented lines in the receptive field surround often caused a reduction in a cell’s response to an optimally oriented stimulus, but this inhibition could be eliminated by changing the orientation of a few of these elements to colinearity with the centrally located target.},

abstract = {Transcranial alternating current stimulation (tACS) is used in clinical applications and basic neuroscience research. Although its behavioral effects are evident from prior reports, current understanding of the mechanisms that underlie these effects is limited. We used motion perception, a percept with relatively well known properties and underlying neural mechanisms to investigate tACS mechanisms. Healthy human volunteers showed a surprising improvement in motion sensitivity when visual stimuli were paired with 10 Hz tACS. In addition, tACS reduced the motion-after effect, and this reduction was correlated with the improvement in motion sensitivity. Electrical stimulation had no consistent effect when applied before presenting a visual stimulus or during recovery from motion adaptation. Together, these findings suggest that perceptual effects of tACS result from an attenuation of adaptation. Important consequences for the practical use of tACS follow from our work. First, because this mechanism interferes only with adaptation, this suggests that tACS can be targeted at subsets of neurons (by adapting them), even when the applied currents spread widely throughout the brain.

Although such neural changes are most evident during development, adult cortical circuits can be modified by a variety of manipulations, such as perceptual learning and visual deprivation. Elucidating the underlying mechanisms at the cellular and synaptic levels is an essential step in understanding neural plasticity in the mature animal. Although developmental and adult plasticity share many common features, notable differences may be attributed to developmental cortical changes at multiple levels. These range from shifts in the molecular profiles of cortical neurons to changes in the spatiotemporal dynamics of network activity. In this review, we will discuss recent progress and remaining challenges in understanding adult visual plasticity, focusing on the primary visual cortex.},

Particularly when experiments involve dynamics of neuronal response, scientific inference can become subtle and some statistical methods may make much more efficient use of the data than others. This article reviews well-established statistical principles, which provide useful guidance, and argues that good statistical practice can substantially enhance results. Recent work on estimation of firing rate, population coding, and time-varying correlation provides improvements in experimental sensitivity equivalent to large increases in the number of neurons examined. Modern nonparametric methods are applicable to data from repeated trials. Many within-trial analyses based on a Poisson assumption can be extended to non-Poisson data. New methods have made it possible to track changes in receptive fields, and to study trial-to-trial variation, with modest amounts of data.},

This layer contains the corticothalamic neurons, which gate thalamic activity and play a critical role in attention. Our experiments tested nicotinic excitation across postnatal development, using whole-cell recordings in prefrontal brain slices from rats. These experiments showed that layer VI neurons have peak nicotinic currents during the first postnatal month, a time period of intensive cortical development in rodents. We demonstrate that these currents are mediated directly by postsynaptic nicotinic receptors and can be suppressed by a competitive antagonist of 4Œ≤2* nicotinic receptors. To record from identified corticothalamic neurons, we performed stereotaxic surgery to label the neurons projecting to medial dorsal thalamus. As hypothesized, recordings from these retrogradely labeled neurons in layer VI showed prominent nicotinic currents. Finally, we examined the effects of the drug nicotine on layer VI neurons and probed for the potential involvement of the accessory subunit, 5, in their receptors. A level of nicotine similar to that found in the blood of smokers elicits a stable inward current in layer VI neurons, yet this exposure desensitizes 50% of the subsequent current elicited by acetylcholine. An allosteric modulator of 4Œ≤25 receptors resulted in a 2.5-fold potentiation of submaximal nicotinic currents. This result is consistent with the expression of the relatively rare 5 nicotinic subunit in layer VI. In summary, we show that layer VI corticothalamic neurons can be strongly excited during development by an unusual subtype of nicotinic receptor.},

Throughout, reaction times (RTs) to simultaneous presentations of color and direction targets were too fast to be reconciled with models proposing separate and independent processing of such stimulus dimensions. Thus, the data provide behavioral evidence for an integration of color and motion signals. This integration occurred even across superimposed surfaces in a transparent motion stimulus and also across spatial locations, arguing against object- and location-based accounts of attentional selection in such a task.

Effects of attention typically vary in magnitude, not only between visual cortical areas but also between individual neurons from the same area. Here, we investigate whether the size of attentional effects depends on the match between the tuning properties of the recorded neuron and the perceptual task at hand. We recorded extracellular responses from individual direction-selective neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of rhesus monkeys trained to attend either to the color or the motion signal of a moving stimulus. We found that effects of spatial and feature-based attention in MT, which are typically observed in tasks allocating attention to motion, were very similar even when attention was directed to the color of the stimulus. We conclude that attentional modulation can occur in extrastriate cortex, even under conditions without a match between the tuning properties of the recorded neuron and the perceptual task at hand. Our data are consistent with theories of object-based attention describing a transfer of attention from relevant to irrelevant features, within the attended object and across the visual field. These results argue for a unified attentional system that modulates responses to a stimulus across cortical areas, even if a given area is specialized for processing task-irrelevant aspects of that stimulus.},

A recently proposed decomposition of synergy revealed that redundancy introduced by common tuning preferences is more than just compensated by noise correlations which mostly contributed synergistically. Based on a pooled response code, the contribution of noise correlations diminished resulting in a severe information loss. Thus, to operate economically, cortical neurons should either employ a labeled-line code or, if using pooled responses, be highly selective in choosing afferents.},

Strong opponent inhibition enables recognition of stimulus orientation in a manner invariant to stimulus contrast. These principles may apply to cortex more generally: Hebb-like plasticity can guide layer 4 of any piece of cortex to create opposition between anticorrelated stimulus pairs, and this enables recognition of specific stimulus patterns in a manner invariant to stimulus magnitude. Properties that are invariant across a cortical column are predicted to be those shared by opponent stimulus pairs; this contrasts with the common idea that a column represents cells with similar response properties},

As a result, little is known about the properties of activity patterns for the natural stimuli processed by the visual system on a daily basis. Furthermore, in the cat, a well-studied model system for visual processing, most results are obtained from anesthetized subjects and little is known about neuronal activations in the alert animal. Addressing these issues, we measure local field potentials (lfp) and multiunit spikes in the primary visual cortex of awake cats. We compare changes in the lfp power spectra and multiunit firing rates for natural movies, movies with modified spatio-temporal correlations as well as gratings. The activity patterns elicited by drifting gratings are qualitatively and quantitatively different from those elicited by natural stimuli and this difference arises from both spatial as well as temporal properties of the stimuli. Furthermore, both local field potentials and multiunit firing rates are most sensitive to the second-order statistics of the stimuli and not to their higher-order properties. Finally, responses to natural movies show a large variability over time because of activity fluctuations induced by rapid stimulus motion. We show that these fluctuations are not dependent on the detailed spatial properties of the stimuli but depend on their temporal jitter. These fluctuations are important characteristics of visual activity under natural conditions and impose limitations on the readout of possible differences in mean activity levels},

We measured eye movements of macaque monkeys freely viewing a set of natural and manipulated images outside a particular task. To probe the effect of scene content, we locally introduced patches of pink noise into natural images, and to probe the interaction with image structure, we altered the contrast of the noise. We found that fixations specifically targeted the natural image parts and spared the uninformative noise patches. However, both increasing and decreasing the contrast of the noise attracted more fixations, and, in the extreme cases, compensated the effect of missing content. Introducing patches from another natural image led to similar results. In all paradigms tested, the interaction between scene structure and informative scene content was the same in any of the first six fixations on an image, demonstrating that the weighting of these factors is constant during viewing of an image. These results question theories, which suggest that initial fixations are driven by stimulus structure whereas later fixations are determined by informative scene content.},

abstract = {We study a recently proposed “correlation-based,” push-pull model of the circuitry of layer 4 of cat visual cortex. This model was previously shown to explain the contrast-invariance of cortical orientation tuning. Here we show that it can simultaneously account for several contrast-dependent (c-d) “nonlinearities” in cortical responses. These include an advance with increasing contrast in the temporal phase of response to a sinusoidally modulated stimulus; a change in shape of the temporal frequency tuning curve, so that higher temporal frequencies may give little or no response at low contrast but reasonable responses at high contrast; and contrast saturation that occurs at lower contrasts in cortex than in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). In the context of the model circuit, these properties arise from a mixture of nonlinear cellular and synaptic mechanisms: short-term synaptic depression, spike-rate adaptation, contrast-induced changes in cellular conductance, and the nonzero spike threshold. The former three mechanisms are sufficient to explain the experimentally observed increase in c-d phase advance in cortex relative to LGN. The c-d changes in temporal frequency tuning arise as a threshold effect: voltage modulations in response to higher-frequency inputs are only slightly above threshold at lower contrast, but become robustly suprathreshold at higher contrast. The other three nonlinear mechanisms also play a crucial role in this result, allowing contrast dependence of temporal frequency tuning to coexist with contrast-invariance of orientation tuning. Contrast saturation, and the observation that responses to stimuli of increasing temporal frequency saturate at increasingly high contrasts, can be induced both by the model’s push-pull inhibition and by synaptic depression. Previous proposals explained these nonlinear response properties by assuming contrast-invariant orientation tuning as a starting point, and adding normalization by shunting inhibition derived equally from cells of all preferred orientations. The present proposal simultaneously explains both contrast-invariant orientation tuning and these contrast-dependent nonlinearities and requires only processing that is local in orientation, in agreement with intracellular measurements},

abstract = {Neurons in auditory cortex are central to our perception of sounds. However, the underlying neural codes, and the relevance of millisecond-precise spike timing in particular, remain debated. Here, we addressed this issue in the auditory cortex of alert nonhuman primates by quantifying the amount of information carried by precise spike timing about complex sounds presented for extended periods of time (random tone sequences and natural sounds). We investigated the dependence of stimulus information on the temporal precision at which spike times were registered and found that registering spikes at a precision coarser than a few milliseconds significantly reduced the encoded information. This dependence demonstrates that auditory cortex neurons can carry stimulus information at high temporal precision. In addition, we found that the main determinant of finely timed information was rapid modulation of the firing rate, whereas higher-order correlations between spike times contributed negligibly. Although the neural coding precision was high for random tone sequences and natural sounds, the information lost at a precision coarser than a few milliseconds was higher for the stimulus sequence that varied on a faster time scale (random tones), suggesting that the precision of cortical firing depends on the stimulus dynamics. Together, these results provide a neural substrate for recently reported behavioral relevance of precisely timed activity patterns with auditory cortex. In addition, they highlight the importance of millisecond-precise neural coding as general functional principle of auditory processing--from the periphery to cortex.},

The visual stimuli remained on the screen as the discrimination process distinguished target from distractors. In a choice response task the color of a central cue signaled which stimulus from a previously presented array of colored stimuli was to be the target of a saccade. The stimulus array was turned off well before the central cue was presented. Most neurons showed activity aligned on both the visual input and the motor response in single-target tasks. Many of these same neurons showed additional discharge that was correlated with the required higher-level decision processes in both of these more natural visual tasks. In the case of pop-out search the SC has been shown to be functionally involved in the decision processes. The cue-aligned activity in SC in the choice response task is surprising because no transient visual stimulus appeared in the response field of the neuron.},

Although it is well known that layer 4 cortical neurons are highly sensitive to the timing of thalamic inputs, the role of the stimulus-driven timing of thalamic inputs in cortical orientation selectivity is not well understood. Here we show that the synchronization of thalamic firing contributes directly to the orientation tuned responses of primary visual cortex in a way that optimizes the stimulus information per cortical spike. From the recorded responses of geniculate X-cells in the anesthetized cat, we synthesized thalamic sub-populations that would likely serve as the synaptic input to a common layer 4 cortical neuron based on anatomical constraints. We used this synchronized input as the driving input to an integrate-and-fire model of cortical responses and demonstrated that the tuning properties match closely to those measured in primary visual cortex. By modulating the overall level of synchronization at the preferred orientation, we show that efficiency of information transmission in the cortex is maximized for levels of synchronization which match those reported in thalamic recordings in response to naturalistic stimuli, a property which is relatively invariant to the orientation tuning width. These findings indicate evidence for a more prominent role of the feed-forward thalamic input in cortical feature selectivity based on thalamic synchronization.},

Recently, the limits of what can be achieved in vivo have been pushed into terrain that was previously only accessible in vitro, due to advances in both physical-imaging technology and the design of molecular contrast agents.},

abstract = {Neural activity manifests itself as complex spatiotemporal activation patterns in cell populations. Even for local neural circuits, a comprehensive description of network activity has been impossible so far. Here we demonstrate that two-photon calcium imaging of bulk-labeled tissue permits dissection of local input and output activities in rat neocortex in vivo. Besides astroglial and neuronal calcium transients, we found spontaneous calcium signals in the neuropil that were tightly correlated to the electrocorticogram. This optical encephalogram (OEG) is shown to represent bulk calcium signals in axonal structures, thus providing a measure of local input activity. Simultaneously, output activity in local neuronal populations could be derived from action potential-evoked calcium transients with single-spike resolution. By using these OEG and spike activity measures, we characterized spontaneous activity during cortical Up states. We found that (i) spiking activity is sparse (<0.1 Hz); (ii) on average, only approximately 10% of neurons are active during each Up state; (iii) this active subpopulation constantly changes with time; and (iv) spiking activity across the population is evenly distributed throughout the Up-state duration. Furthermore, the number of active neurons directly depended on the amplitude of the OEG, thus optically revealing an input-output function for the local network. We conclude that spontaneous activity in the neocortex is sparse and heterogeneously distributed in space and time across the neuronal population. The dissection of the various signal components in bulk-loaded tissue as demonstrated here will enable further studies of signal flow through cortical networks.},

An orderly pattern of domains has been described for preferences to ocular dominance, orientation, and spatial frequency. Temporal frequency preference, another important attribute of the visual scene, also might be expected to map into different domains. Using optical imaging and a variety of quantitative methods, we examined how temporal frequency selectivity is mapped in V1 of the prosimian primate, bush baby (Otolemur garnetti). We found that unlike other attribute maps, selectivity for different temporal frequencies is arranged uniformly across V1 with no evidence of local clustering. Global tuning for temporal frequency, based on magnitude of response, showed a good match to previous tuning curves for single neurons. A peak response was found around 2.0 Hz, with smaller attenuation at lower temporal frequencies than at higher frequencies. We also examined whether the peak temporal frequency response differed between anatomical compartments defined by cytochrome oxidase (CO). No significant differences in the preference for temporal frequency were found between these CO compartments. Our findings show that key se},

The variance and correlation of the conditional expectation exposed several neural mechanisms: mixtures of firing rate states preceding the decision, accumulation of stochastic ‚Äúevidence‚Äù during decision formation, and a stereotyped response at decision end.

Here, we examine responses of a large number (>600) of neurons in monkey inferior temporal (IT) cortex with a large number (>1,000) of natural and artificial object images. During the recordings, the monkeys performed a passive fixation task. We found that the categorical structure of objects is represented by the pattern of activity distributed over the cell population. Animate and inanimate objects created distinguishable clusters in the population code. The global category of animate objects was divided into bodies, hands, and faces. Faces were divided into primate and nonprimate faces, and the primate-face group was divided into human and monkey faces. Bodies of human, birds, and four-limb animals clustered together, whereas lower animals such as fish, reptile, and insects made another cluster. Thus the cluster analysis showed that IT population responses reconstruct a large part of our intuitive category structure, including the global division into animate and inanimate objects, and further hierarchical subdivisions of animate objects. The representation of categories was distributed in several respects, e.g., the similarity of response patterns to stimuli within a category was maintained by both the cells that maximally responded to the category and the cells that responded weakly to the category. These results advance our understanding of the nature of the IT neural code, suggesting an inherently categorical representation that comprises a range of categories including the amply investigated face category.},

abstract = {Organization of the central visual pathway is generally studied from a perspective of feedforward processes. However, there are horizontal connections and also strong feedback from extra striate to visual cortex. Here, we use visual stimuli designed to maximize relative differential involvements of these three main types of connections. The approach relies on differences between stimulation within the classical receptive field (CRF) and that of the surround region. Although previous studies have used similar approaches, they were limited primarily to spatial segregation of neural connections. Our experimental design provides clear segregation of fast and slow components of surround modulation. We assume these are mediated by feedback and horizontal connections, respectively, but other factors may be involved. Our results imply that both horizontal and feedback connections contribute to integration of visual information outside the CRF and provide suppressive or facilitative modulation. For a given cell, modulation may change in strength and sign from suppression to facilitation or the reverse depending on surround parameters. Sub-threshold input from the CRF surround increases local field potential (LFP) power in distinct frequency ranges which differ for suppression and facilitation. Horizontal connections have delayed CRF-surround modulation and are sensitive to position changes in the surround. Therefore, surround information beyond the CRF is initially processed by fast connections which we consider to be feedback, whereas spatially tuned mechanisms are relatively slow and presumably mediated by horizontal connections. Overall, results suggest that convergent fast (feedforward) inputs determine size and structure of the CRFs of recipient cells in visual cortex. And fast connections from extra striate regions (feedback) plus slow-tuned connections (horizontal) within visual cortex contribute to spatial influences of CRF surround activation.},

We compared the synaptic impact of L6 CT cells on neurons in layers 4 and 5. We found that the axons of L6 CT neurons densely ramified within layer 5a in both visual and somatosensory cortices of the mouse. Optogenetic activation of corticothalamic neurons generated large EPSPs in pyramidal neurons in layer 5a. In contrast, excitatory neurons in layer 4 exhibited weak excitation or disynaptic inhibition. Fast-spiking parvalbumin-positive cells in both layer 5a and layer 4 were also strongly activated by L6 CT neurons. The overall effect of L6 CT activation was to suppress layer 4 while eliciting action potentials in layer 5a pyramidal neurons. Together, our data indicate that L6 CT neurons strongly activate an output layer of the cortex.},

abstract = {The spike activity of single neurons of the primary visual cortex (V1) becomes more selective and reliable in response to wide-field natural scenes compared to smaller stimuli confined to the classical receptive field (RF). However, it is largely unknown what aspects of natural scenes increase the selectivity of V1 neurons. One hypothesis is that modulation by surround interaction is highly sensitive to small changes in spatiotemporal aspects of RF surround. Such a fine-tuned modulation would enable single neurons to hold information about spatiotemporal sequences of oriented stimuli, which extends the role of V1 neurons as a simple spatiotemporal filter confined to the RF. In the current study, we examined the hypothesis in the V1 of awake behaving monkeys, by testing whether the spike response of single V1 neurons is modulated by temporal interval of spatiotemporal stimulus sequence encompassing inside and outside the RF. We used two identical Gabor stimuli that were sequentially presented with a variable stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA): the preceding one (S1) outside the RF and the following one (S2) in the RF. This stimulus configuration enabled us to examine the spatiotemporal selectivity of response modulation from a focal surround region. Although S1 alone did not evoke spike responses, visual response to S2 was modulated for SOA in the range of tens of milliseconds. These results suggest that V1 neurons participate in processing spatiotemporal sequences of oriented stimuli extending outside the RF.},

In the current study, two identical Gabor stimuli were sequentially presented with a variable stimulus onset asynchrony (SOA) ranging from 0 to 100 ms: the first (S1) outside the RF and the second (S2) over the RF of primary visual cortex neurons, while trained monkeys performed a fixation task. This focal and asynchronous stimulation of the RF surround enabled us to analyze the modulation of S2-evoked spike activity and covariation between spike and LFP modulation across SOA. In this condition, the modulation of S2-evoked spike response was dominantly facilitative and was correlated with the change in LFP amplitude, which was pronounced for the cells recorded in the upper cortical layers. The time course of covariation between the SOA-dependent spike modulation and LFP amplitude suggested that the subthreshold LFP evoked by the S1 can predict the magnitude of upcoming spike modulation.},

abstract = {Our attention to a sensory cue of a given modality interferes with attention to a sensory cue of another modality. However, an object emitting various sensory cues attracts attention more effectively. The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) could play a pivotal role in such cross-modal modulation of attention given that cross-modal sensory interaction takes place in the TRN, because the TRN occupies a highly strategic position to function in the control of gain and/or gating of sensory processing in the thalamocortical loop. In the present study cross-modal interactions between visual and auditory inputs were examined in single TRN cells of anesthetised rats using juxta-cellular recording and labeling techniques. Visual or auditory responses were modulated by subthreshold sound or light stimuli, respectively, in the majority of recordings (46 of 54 visual and 60 of 73 auditory cells). However, few bimodal sensory cells were found. Cells showing modulation of the sensory response were distributed in the whole visual and auditory sectors of the TRN. Modulated cells sent axonal projections to first-order or higher-order thalamic nuclei. Suppression predominated in modulation that took place not only in primary responses but also in late responses repeatedly evoked after sensory stimulation. Combined sensory stimulation also evoked de-novo responses, and modulated response latency and burst spiking. These results indicate that the TRN incorporates sensory inputs of different modalities into single cell activity to function in sensory processing in the lemniscal and non-lemniscal systems. This raises the possibility that the TRN constitutes neural pathways involved in cross-modal attentional gating.},

abstract = {Sparse coding models of natural scenes can account for several physiological properties of primary visual cortex (V1), including the shapes of simple cell receptive fields (RFs) and the highly kurtotic firing rates of V1 neurons. Current spiking network models of pattern learning and sparse coding require direct inhibitory connections between the excitatory simple cells, in conflict with the physiological distinction between excitatory (glutamatergic) and inhibitory (GABAergic) neurons (Dale’s Law). At the same time, the computational role of inhibitory neurons in cortical microcircuit function has yet to be fully explained. Here we show that adding a separate population of inhibitory neurons to a spiking model of V1 provides conformance to Dale’s Law, proposes a computational role for at least one class of interneurons, and accounts for certain observed physiological properties in V1. When trained on natural images, this excitatory-inhibitory spiking circuit learns a sparse code with Gabor-like RFs as found in V1 using only local synaptic plasticity rules. The inhibitory neurons enable sparse code formation by suppressing predictable spikes, which actively decorrelates the excitatory population. The model predicts that only a small number of inhibitory cells is required relative to excitatory cells and that excitatory and inhibitory input should be correlated, in agreement with experimental findings in visual cortex. We also introduce a novel local learning rule that measures stimulus-dependent correlations between neurons to support “explaining away” mechanisms in neural coding.},

We used intrinsic signal optical imaging in alert fixating macaques to measure the strength and cortical distribution of V1 interactions amongst collinear bars. A single short bar stimulus produced a broad-peaked hill of activation (the optical point spread) covering multiple orientation hypercolumns in V1. Flanking the bar stimulus with a pair of identical collinear bars led to a strong nonlinear suppression in the optical signal. This nonlinearity was strongest over the center bar region, with a spatial distribution that cannot be explained by a simple gain control. It was a function of the relative orientation and separation of the bar stimuli in a manner tuned sharply for collinearity, being strongest for immediately adjacent bars lying on a smooth contour. These results suggest intracortical interactions playing a major role in determining V1 activation by smooth extended contours. Our finding that the interaction is primarily suppressive when imaged optically, which presumably reflects the combined inhibitory and excitatory inputs, suggests a complex interplay between these cortical inputs leading to the collinear facilitation seen in the spiking response of V1 neurons. The tuned suppression of the envelope of activity when presenting stimuli of increasing complexity indicates that a complex stimulus is represented not only by the neuronal ensemble that is activated but also by those that are selectively eliminated.},

Neuronal responses to a single oriented line segment placed within a cell’s classical receptive field (CRF) were compared with responses in which the center element was surrounded by rings of elements placed entirely outside the CRF. The orientations of the surround elements either matched the center element, were orthogonal to it, or were random. 2. The addition of the textured surround tended to suppress the response to the center element by an average of 34%. Overall, almost 80% of the 122 cells analyzed in detail were significantly suppressed by at least one of the texture surrounds. 3. Cells tended to respond more strongly to a stimulus in which there was a contrast in orientation between the center and surround than to a stimulus lacking such contrast. The average difference was 9% of the response to the optimally oriented center element alone. For the 32% of the cells showing a statistically significant orientation contrast effect, the average difference was 28%. 4. Both the general suppression and orientation contrast effects originated from surround regions at the ends of the center bar as well as regions along the sides of the center bar. 5. The amount of suppression induced by the texture surround decreased as the density of the texture elements decreased. 6. Both the general suppression and the orientation contrast effects appeared early in the population response to the stimuli. The general suppression effect took approximately 7 ms to develop, whereas the orientation contrast effect took 18-20 ms to develop. 7.

abstract = {A mechanistic understanding of attention is necessary for the elucidation of the neurobiological basis of conscious experience. This chapter presents a framework for thinking about attention that facilitates the analysis of this cognitive process in terms of underlying neural mechanisms. Four processes are fundamental to attention: working memory, top-down sensitivity control, competitive selection, and automatic bottom-up filtering for salient stimuli. Each process makes a distinct and essential contribution to attention. Voluntary control of attention involves the first three processes (working memory, top-down sensitivity control, and competitive selection) operating in a recurrent loop. Recent results from neurobiological research on attention are discussed within this framework.},

abstract = {Items that stand out from their surroundings, that is, those that attract attention, are considered to be salient. Salience is generated by input features in many stimulus dimensions, like motion (M), color (C), orientation (O), and others. We focus on bottom-up salience generated by contrast between the feature properties of an item and its surroundings. We compare the singleton search reaction times (RTs) of items that differ from their surroundings in more than one feature (e.g., C + O, denoted as CO) against the RTs of items that differ from their surroundings in only a single feature (e.g., O or C). The measured RTs for the double-feature singletons are compared against “race model” predictions to evaluate whether salience in the double-feature conditions is greater than the salience of either of its feature components. Affirmative answers were found in MO and CO but not in CM. These results are consistent with some V1 neurons being conjunctively selective to MO, others to CO, but almost none to CM. They provide support for the V1 hypothesis of bottom-up salience (Z. Li, 2002) but are contrary to expectation from the “feature summation” hypothesis, in which different stimulus features are initially analyzed independently and subsequently summed to form a single salience map (L. Itti & C. Koch, 2001; C. Koch & S. Ullman, 1985; J. M. Wolfe, K. R. Cave, & S. L. Franzel, 1989).},

The amount of information that spike trains encode is usually estimated from the precision of spike timing with respect to the stimulus. Sensory input, however, is only one factor that influences neural activity. For example, intrinsic dynamics, such as oscillations of networks of neurons, also modulate firing pattern. Here, we asked if retinal oscillations might help to convey information to neurons downstream. Specifically, we made whole-cell recordings from relay cells to reveal retinal inputs (EPSPs) and thalamic outputs (spikes) and then analyzed these events with information theory. Our results show that thalamic spike trains operate as two multiplexed channels. One channel, which occupies a low frequency band (<30 Hz), is encoded by average firing rate with respect to the stimulus and carries information about local changes in the visual field over time. The other operates in the gamma frequency band (40-80 Hz) and is encoded by spike timing relative to retinal oscillations. At times, the second channel conveyed even more information than the first. Because retinal oscillations involve extensive networks of ganglion cells, it is likely that the second channel transmits information about global features of the visual scene.},

title = {Is predictive coding theory articulated enough to be testable}, 
journal = {Front Comput Neurosci}, 
volume = {9}, 
number = {}, 
pages = {111}, 
year = {2015}, 
abstract = {Predictive coding theory (Srinivasan et al., 1982; Mumford, 1992; Rao and Ballard, 1999) claims that the function of the hierarchical organization in the cortex is to reconcile representations and predictions of sensory input at multiple levels. It does this because the dynamics of neural activity is geared toward minimizing the error: the difference between the input representation at each level and the prediction originating from a higher level representation. In other words, the neural activities in the whole hierarchy settle to a state where the difference between the prediction and the representation of sensory input is minimal. This view has gained enormous popularity, and research applying this theoretical framework to explain various kinds of empirical data has flourished since then (Friston, 2010; Clark, 2013b).

Predictive coding theory is a mechanistic theory: it aims to describe the neurocomputational machinery. Hence, merely describing phenomenological data in the terminology of the theoretical framework is not sufficient. The theory should allow the empirical data to be explained by neurocomputational mechanisms and the proposed mechanisms should be testable at the neurophysiological level. To do this, the details of the mechanisms, especially how the errors are computed and minimized, need to be articulated in neuronal terms. Note that error signals at each level influence neural activities in two ways in this framework. First, they are fed forward to the higher level(s) where they influence the neural activities of the higher level representation(s). The resulting predictions are in turn fed back to the lower level. Second, at the same time, the error signals also influence the response properties of the neurons at the same level and the representation of the sensory input is modified. The updating of the prediction and the changes to the lower level representation are made to improve their match. Through this two-way process of reconciliation the error signals are minimized. However, the possibility of simultaneous changes in both higher level prediction and lower level representations, and mixed populations of error neurons and sensory representation neurons within the same local circuit, give rise to a “multiple choices” problem. This problem is significant when using empirical data such as fMRI, EEG, and unit recordings to test the theory. For example, how do we determine whether a single unit being recorded is an error neuron or a neuron representing input? Note that in the model of Rao and Ballard (1999), endstopping cells function as error neurons because they signal the sudden stop of the line segment while continuation of the line is predicted. On the contrary, Kapadia et al. (1995) showed that the neural response to a line segment increases when collinear line segments are presented outside of the classic receptive field. In the former case, the increase of the neural signal is explained because of the mismatch of the input with the prediction while in the latter case, the increase would be explained because the input matches the prediction. How is this apparent inconsistency of explanations resolved? Or consider Kanizsa’s illusory surface (Kanizsa, 1955). It has been shown that neurons in lower level visual cortex are activated at the location of illusory contours (von der Heydt et al., 1984). Are they considered as error neurons or representation neurons? In other words, are they active because of the mismatch between the input and the prediction giving rise to error signal, or because the representation signal is modified to match the prediction? The same applies to recordings of the activity of a population of neurons such as those obtained via fMRI: is an increase of the fMRI signal due to an increased error signal or to changes in the input representation? And does the process of reconciliation between the lower level representation and the prediction result in silencing of error neurons and if so, is this detectable in the data? The last question is particularly crucial because it has been suggested that reduction of neural signals at the lower level can be explained in terms of error minimization (Murray et al., 2002; Summerfield et al., 2008; den Ouden et al., 2009; Alink et al., 2010; Todorovic et al., 2011; Kok et al., 2012b). To overcome these problems of testability, the theory must be articulated in sufficient neurophysiological detail, particularly in regard to the mechanisms of error computation and minimization.},

We hypothesize that completion is a result of computing the figure-ground organization.

The implications of this result to the general property of emerging Gestalt percepts are discussed.},

In contrast, we have only recently begun to appreciate the roles of slow inhibition via GABA(B) receptors in the control of cortical network activity. Here, we provide a framework for understanding the contributions of GABA(B) receptors in helping mediate, modulate, and moderate different types of physiological and pathological cortical network activity. We demonstrate how the slow time course of GABA(B) receptor-mediated inhibition is well suited to help mediate the slow oscillation, to modulate the power and spatial profile of gamma oscillations, and to moderate the relative spike timing of individual neurons during theta oscillations. We further suggest that GABA(B) receptors are interesting therapeutic targets in pathological conditions where cortical network activity is disturbed, such as epilepsy and schizophrenia.},

Signal detection analyses were performed on the data from the forced-choice task and on the subjective confidence ratings. The results showed that OSM reduced sensitivity to the presence of the target, indicating that reentry is critical for awareness of object presence. Consistent with the idea that OSM leaves feedforward processing intact, confidence ratings in reported target-absent trials were lower for misses (target present, no response) than for correct rejections (target absent, no response), implying that a target-related sensory signal was available for subjective ratings in spite of reported absence of the target.

Magnetic stimulation of V1/V2 impaired masked priming 30-90 ms after the onset of the prime. Stimulation of LO reduced the magnitude of masked priming at 90-120 ms, but this effect occurred only in the early parts of the priming experiment. A control task measuring the visibility of masked primes indicated that the orientation of masked primes could not be consciously discriminated and that TMS did not influence the conscious visibility of the primes indirectly by reducing the effectiveness of the mask in the critical time windows. We conclude that feedforward sweep of processing from V1/V2 (30-90 ms) to LO (90 ms and above) is necessary for unconscious priming of shape, whereas conscious perception requires also the contribution of recurrent (feedback) processing.},

One possible explanation is that in these experiments, prediction (i.e., stimulus probability) is confounded with attention (i.e., task relevance), which is known to boost rather than reduce sensory signal. However, recent theoretical work on predictive coding inspires an alternative hypothesis and suggests that attention and prediction operate synergistically to improve the precision of perceptual inference. This model posits that attention leads to heightened weighting of sensory evidence, thereby reversing the sensory silencing by prediction. Here, we factorially manipulated attention and prediction in a functional magnetic resonance imaging study and distinguished between these 2 hypotheses. Our results support a predictive coding model wherein attention reverses the sensory attenuation of predicted signals.},

abstract = {In addition to bottom-up input, the visual cortex receives large amounts of feedback from other cortical areas [1-3]. One compelling example of feedback activation of early visual neurons in the absence of bottom-up input occurs during the famous Kanizsa illusion, where a triangular shape is perceived, even in regions of the image where there is no bottom-up visual evidence for it. This illusion increases the firing activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex with a receptive field on the illusory contour [4]. Feedback signals are largely segregated from feedforward signals within each cortical area, with feedforward signals arriving in the middle layer, while top-down feedback avoids the middle layers and predominantly targets deep and superficial layers [1, 2, 5, 6]. Therefore, the feedback-mediated activity increase in V1 during the perception of illusory shapes should lead to a specific laminar activity profile that is distinct from the activity elicited by bottom-up stimulation. Here, we used fMRI at high field (7 T) to empirically test this hypothesis, by probing the cortical response to illusory figures in human V1 at different cortical depths [7-14]. We found that, whereas bottom-up stimulation activated all cortical layers, feedback activity induced by illusory figures led to a selective activation of the deep layers of V1. These results demonstrate the potential for non-invasive recordings of neural activity with laminar specificity in humans and elucidate the role of top-down signals during perceptual processing.},

Here, we have used functional magnetic resonance imaging and the retinotopic mapping technique, which has very recently disclosed the organization of the visual field maps within the monkey MT/V5 cluster. We observed a retinotopic organization in humans very similar to that documented in monkeys: an MT/V5 cluster that includes areas MT/V5, pMSTv (putative ventral part of the medial superior temporal area), pFST (putative fundus of the superior temporal area), and pV4t (putative V4 transitional zone), and neighbors a more ventral putative human posterior inferior temporal area (phPIT) cluster. The four areas in the MT/V5 cluster and the two areas in the phPIT cluster each represent the complete contralateral hemifield. The complete MT/V5 cluster comprises 70% of the motion localizer activation. Human MT/V5 is located in the region bound by lateral, anterior, and inferior occipital sulci and occupies only one-fifth of the motion complex. It shares the basic functional properties of its monkey homolog: receptive field size relative to other areas, response to moving and static stimuli, as well as sensitivity to three-dimensional structure from motion. Functional properties sharply distinguish the MT/V5 cluster from its immediate neighbors in the phPIT cluster and the LO (lateral occipital) regions. Together with similarities in retinotopic organization and topological neighborhood, the functional properties suggest that MT/V5 in human and macaque cortex are homologous.},

abstract = {Filling-in is a perceptual phenomenon in which a visual attribute such as colour, brightness, texture or motion is perceived in a region of the visual field even though such an attribute exists only in the surround. Filling-in dramatically reveals the dissociation between the retinal input and the percept, and raises fundamental questions about how these two relate to each other. Filling-in is observed in various situations, and is an essential part of our normal surface perception. Here, I review recent experiments examining brain activities associated with filling-in, and discuss possible neural mechanisms underlying this remarkable perceptual phenomenon. The evidence shows that neuronal activities in early visual cortical areas are involved in filling-in, providing new insights into visual cortical functions.},

How and where does the brain link cross-modal sensory information to produce such behavioral advantages? The classical role of sensory thalamus is to relay modality-specific information to the cortex. Here we find that, in the rat thalamus, visual cues influence auditory responses, which have two distinct components: an early phasic one followed by a late gradual buildup that peaks before reward. Although both bimodal presentation and reward value had similar effects on behavioral performance, the cross-modal effect on neural activity showed unique temporal dynamics: it affected the amplitude of the early component and starting level of the late component, whereas reward value affected only the slope of the late component. These results demonstrate that cross-modal cueing modulates gain in the sensory thalamus, potentially providing a priming influence on the choice of an optimal behavior.},

In both streams, areas at intermediate processing stages in extrastriate cortex (V4, V3A, MT and V7) showed object-selective but viewpoint- and size-specific responses. In contrast, higher-order areas in lateral occipital and posterior parietal cortex (LOC, IPS1 and IPS2) responded selectively to objects independent of image transformations. Contrary to the two-pathways hypothesis, our findings indicate that basic object information related to shape, size and viewpoint may be represented similarly in two parallel and hierarchically organized neural systems in the ventral and dorsal visual pathways.},

We discuss how future experiments could distinguish predictive coding from alternative explanations of this response profile.

abstract = {The perception of flicker strength in a circular stimulus can be changed by altering the relative temporal phase of a simultaneously flickering surrounding annulus: perceived flicker is weak when the two stimuli are modulated in-phase and strong when the two are modulated in counter-phase. Previously, we found that responses of single neurons in the monkey lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to such stimuli resemble the psychophysical data. On the basis of the resemblance in data, it was proposed that the physiological basis for the flicker perception may be present as proximal as the LGN. To strengthen this hypothesis, we simulated the response of an array of LGN neurons, the receptive fields (RFs) of which are covered by the stimulus. The simulations were based upon single-cell recordings in the LGN of anaesthetized marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) using the same stimuli as previously. The measurements were repeated for different spatial displacement between the stimulus and the RF. The responses depended upon the spatial displacement and the relative phase between centre and surround stimuli. The neuronal responses can be adequately described by a difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) model with a time delay in the RF surround. The model responses at different displacements can be considered to be identical to the output of an array of ideal and identical LGN cells with different RF locations. To be able to describe physiological and psychophysical data, obtained at different stimulus contrasts, it was necessary to consider previously described non-linear interactions between the RF centres and surrounds. We applied a spatial peak-to-trough detector with a subsequent saturation and threshold to simulate a simple cortical decision mechanism. The output of this peak-to-trough detector could adequately describe the psychophysical data.},

abstract = {The macaque middle temporal area (MT) is exquisitely sensitive to visual motion and there is a large amount of evidence that neural activity in MT is tightly correlated with the perception of motion. The mechanisms by which MT neurons achieve their directional selectivity, however, have received considerably less attention. We investigated the motion-energy model as a description of motion mechanisms in macaque MT. We first confirmed one of the predictions of the motion-energy model; macaques-just like humans-perceive a reversed direction of motion when a stimulus reverses contrast with every displacement (reverse-phi). This reversal of perceived direction had a clear correlate in the neural responses of MT cells, which were predictive of the monkey’s behavioral decisions. Second, we investigated how multiple motion-energy components are combined. Psychophysical data have been used to argue that motion-energy components representing opposite directions are subtracted from each other. Our data show, however, that the interactions among motion-energy components are more complex. In particular, we found that the influence of a given component on the response to a stimulus consisting of multiple components depends on factors other than the response to that component alone. This suggests that there are subthreshold nonlinear interactions among multiple motion-energy components; these could take place within MT or in earlier stages of the motion network such as V1. We propose a model that captures the complexity of these component interactions by means of a competitive interaction among the components. This provides a better description of the MT responses than the subtractive motion opponency envisaged in the motion-energy model, even when the latter is combined with a gain-control mechanism. The competitive interaction extends the dynamic range of the cells and allows them to provide information on more subtle changes in motion patterns, including changes that are not purely directional.},

abstract = {Visual motion on the macaque retina is processed by direction- and speed-selective neurons in extrastriate middle temporal cortex (MT). There is strong evidence for a link between the activity of these neurons and direction perception. However, there is conflicting evidence for a link between speed selectivity of MT neurons and speed perception. Here we study this relationship by using a strong perceptual illusion in speed perception: when two transparently superimposed dot patterns move in opposite directions, their apparent speed is much larger than the perceived speed of a single pattern moving at that physical speed. Moreover, the sensitivity for speed discrimination is reduced for such bidirectional patterns. We first confirmed these behavioral findings in human subjects and extended them to a monkey subject. Second, we determined speed tuning curves of MT neurons to bidirectional motion and compared these to speed tuning curves for unidirectional motion. Consistent with previous reports, the response to bidirectional motion was often reduced compared with unidirectional motion at the preferred speed. In addition, we found that tuning curves for bidirectional motion were shifted to lower preferred speeds. As a consequence, bidirectional motion of some speeds typically evoked larger responses than unidirectional motion. Third, we showed that these changes in neural responses could explain changes in speed perception with a simple labeled line decoder. These data provide new insight into the encoding of transparent motion patterns and provide support for the hypothesis that MT activity can be decoded for speed perception with a labeled line model.},

We studied the neural basis of adaptive changes in the middle temporal area (MT) of macaque monkey visual cortex. Our data show that brief adaptation to a moving stimulus reduces the magnitude of neural responses and reduces the width of speed tuning curves. Comparable with what has recently been reported in the direction domain, the response reduction was largest when the test speed was different from the adaptation speed. Using an ideal observer analysis, we show that these response changes in MT are consistent with a reduction in perceived speed as well as an improvement in speed discrimination. This supports the view that adaptive response changes in MT are not just a consequence of neural fatigue, but an active process that enhances the discrimination of speed.},

abstract = {A car driving through the fog appears to move more slowly than one driving on a clear and sunny day. In the laboratory, this observation has been confirmed as a pronounced reduction of perceived speed caused by a reduction in contrast. We measured the influence of contrast on cells in the middle temporal area (MT) of the macaque, which has been hypothesized to underlie the perception of speed. The influence of contrast on the responsiveness and speed tuning of these cells was pervasive and highly regular. As expected, most cells responded less at low contrast. More importantly, the preferred speed of most cells shifted to lower speeds at lower contrasts. Moreover, approximately one-third of cells surprisingly responded more strongly to slow low-contrast stimuli than to slow high-contrast stimuli. Current models of speed perception suggest that each MT cell votes for its preferred speed, with a vote determined by its firing rate. We tested a number of these labeled-line models by entering the neural responses we recorded from MT and comparing the predictions of the models with the perceptual reports of human subjects and monkeys. Contrary to the perceptual reports, the labeled-line models predicted that perceived speed should increase when contrast is decreased. We therefore conclude that perceived speed is not based on a labeled-line interpretation of MT cells.},

These measures can broadly be divided in multivariate measures and averages over bivariate measures. One of the most recent bivariate approaches, the ISI-distance, employs the ratio of instantaneous interspike intervals (ISIs). In this study we propose two extensions of the ISI-distance, the straightforward averaged bivariate ISI-distance and the multivariate ISI-diversity based on the coefficient of variation. Like the original measure these extensions combine many properties desirable in applications to real data. In particular, they are parameter-free, time scale independent, and easy to visualize in a time-resolved manner, as we illustrate with in vitro recordings from a cortical neuron. Using a simulated network of Hindemarsh-Rose neurons as a controlled configuration we compare the performance of our methods in distinguishing different levels of multi-neuron spike train synchrony to the performance of six other previously published measures. We show and explain why the averaged bivariate measures perform better than the multivariate ones and why the multivariate ISI-diversity is the best performer among the multivariate methods. Finally, in a comparison against standard methods that rely on moving window estimates, we use single-unit monkey data to demonstrate the advantages of the instantaneous nature of our methods.},

The presence of a CP in a particular paradigm may be an indicator that the neuron is generally part of the substrate for the perception of binocular depth. We compared the responses of those single neurons that show CPs in one stereoscopic depth task with their responses in another stereo task. Each neuron was tested for the presence of 1) CPs during a task in which macaques responded to the sign of binocular depth in a structure-from-motion stimulus, to judge its direction of three-dimensional rotation and 2) a consistent response to the stereo disparity of binocularly anti-correlated stimuli. Previous work, confirmed here, shows that changing the disparity of these binocularly anti-correlated stimuli often fails to yield a coherent change in the depth percept. For each test alone, there are V5/MT neurons that carry signals that are congruent with the perceptual effects. However, on comparing tests, there is no fixed pool of neurons that can account for the binocular depth percept. Excitation of neurons with a measurable CP does not necessarily lead to a change in perception. The cortical circuitry must be able to make dynamic changes in the pools of neurons that underlie perceptual judgments according to the demands of the task.},

During full field stimulation by coherent motion of random dots, we observed gamma oscillations in approximately 20% of the cells. The average oscillation frequencies differed considerably between both animals (60 Hz vs 100 Hz). In both animals, oscillatory modulation was particularly strong at sites that showed a strong directional bias to visual stimulation. The amount of oscillatory activity was roughly the same whether stimulus movement was presented during fixation or whether the animal had to perform pursuit movements across a stationary visual pattern. If cells were engaged in gamma oscillations during visual stimulation, the amount of oscillatory modulation was dependent on stimulus direction, stimulus velocity and stimulus contrast. During a visually guided manual tracking task no gamma activity was detectable. Cells with clear oscillatory modulation during the full field stimulation failed to show oscillatory activity when the animal was involved in a motor task in which the visual motion information had to be evaluated for the correct movement of the hand. Our results reaffirm the ubiquitous presence of stimulus-induced gamma oscillation in extrastriate areas MT and MST of the awake monkey during various stimulus conditions, but they fail to support the notion that high-frequency gamma oscillations in this area play a specific role during cortical control of a motor response to visual stimulation.},

To pursue this cortical flow of information from visual motion areas to the motor cortex, single-cell activity was recorded from visual areas MT/MST (middle temporal area/medial superior temporal area) and from primary motor cortex (M1) while monkeys tracked moving targets with their right hand. Spike activity of 353 directionally tuned motor cortex cells was combined to a time-varying population vector, and similarly a time-resolved visual population vector was calculated from 252 MT/MST cells. Both population vectors code faithfully for the direction of the collinear motion of target and hand. For a given direction, the length of the population vectors varied over time during the performance of the task. The temporal evolution of both population responses reflects the different relationship between the early visual responses to the moving target and the directional motor command controlling the hand movement. The results indicate that during the visual tracking task visual and motor populations which code for similar directions of movement are co-activated with considerable temporal overlap. Despite this co-activation in both modalities, we failed to observe any significant synchronization between areas MT/MST and M1 Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

abstract = {Fast inhibition in the cortex is gated primarily at GABAergic synapses formed by local interneurons onto postsynaptic targets. Although GABAergic inputs to the somata and axon initial segments of neocortical pyramidal neurons are associated with direct inhibition of action potential generation, the role of GABAergic inputs to distal dendritic segments, including spines, is less well characterized. Because a significant proportion of inhibitory input occurs on distal dendrites and spines, it will be important to determine whether these GABAergic synapses are formed selectively by certain classes of presynaptic cells onto specific postsynaptic elements. By electron microscopic observations of synapses formed by different subtypes of nonpyramidal cells, we found that a surprisingly large fraction (33.4 +/- 9.3%) of terminals formed symmetrical synaptic junctions onto a subset of cortical spines that were mostly coinnervated by an asymmetrical terminal. Using VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 isoform of the glutamate vesicular transporter immunohistochemistry, we found that the double-innervated spines selectively received thalamocortical afferents expressing the VGLUT2 but almost never intracortical inputs expressing the VGLUT1. When comparing the volumes of differentially innervated spines and their synaptic junction areas, we found that spines innervated by VGLUT2-positive terminal were significantly larger than spines innervated by VGLUT1-positive terminal and that these spines had larger, and more often perforated, synapses than those of spines innervated by VGLUT1-positive afferent. These results demonstrate that inhibitory inputs to pyramidal cell spines may preferentially reduce thalamocortical rather than intracortical synaptic transmission and are therefore positioned to selectively gate extracortical information.},

The product of the uncertainties in signaling spatial position (delta x) and spatial frequency (delta f) has, therefore, a theoretical minimum value of delta x delta f = 1/2. We examine the implications that these conclusions have for the relationship between the spatial response profiles of simple cells and the characteristics of their spatial frequency tuning curves. Examples of the spatial frequency tuning curves and their associated spatial response profiles are discussed and illustrated. The advantages for the operation of the visual system of different relationships between the spatial response profiles and the characteristics of the spatial frequency tuning curves are examined.

The representation of binocular disparity in V1 contradicts the global correspondence when the image is binocularly anticorrelated. To solve the stereo correspondence problem, this rudimentary representation of stereoscopic depth needs to be further processed in the extrastriate cortex. Integrating signals over multiple spatial frequency channels is one possible mechanism supported by theoretical and psychophysical studies. We examined selectivities of single V4 neurons for both binocular disparity and spatial frequency in two awake, fixating monkeys. Disparity tuning was examined with a binocularly correlated random-dot stereogram (RDS) as well as its anticorrelated counterpart, whereas spatial frequency tuning was examined with a sine wave grating or a narrowband noise. Neurons with broader spatial frequency tuning exhibited more attenuated disparity tuning for the anticorrelated RDS. Additional rectification at the output of the energy model does not likely account for this attenuation because the degree of attenuation does not differ among the various types of disparity-tuned neurons. The results suggest that disparity energy signals are integrated across spatial frequency channels for generating a representation of stereoscopic depth in V4.},

These fluctuations may induce illusory motion in the channels by a mechanism similar to that responsible for the Omega effect, in which sequences of random patterns of black dots presented in an annular channel produce the perception of illusory rotation of these dots within the annulus.},

abstract = {Predicting the sensory outcomes of action is thought to be useful for distinguishing self- versus externally-generated sensations, correcting movements when sensory feedback is delayed and learning predictive models for motor behavior. Here we show that aspects of another fundamental function, perception, are enhanced when they entail the contribution of predicted sensory outcomes, and that this enhancement relies on the adaptive use of the most stable predictions available. We combined a motor learning paradigm that imposes new sensory predictions with a dynamic visual search task to first show that perceptual feature extraction of a moving stimulus is poorer when it is based on sensory feedback that is misaligned with those predictions. This was possible because our novel experimental design allowed us to override the “natural” sensory predictions present when any action is performed, and separately examine the influence of these two sources on perceptual feature extraction. We then show that if the new predictions induced via motor learning are unreliable, rather than relying just on sensory information for perceptual judgments as is conventionally thought, subjects adaptively transition to using other, stable sensory predictions to maintain greater accuracy in their perceptual judgments. Finally, we show that when sensory predictions are not modified at all, these judgments are sharper when subjects combine their natural predictions with sensory feedback. Collectively, our results highlight the crucial contribution of sensory predictions to perception and also suggest that the brain intelligently integrates the most stable predictions available with sensory information to maintain high fidelity in perceptual decisions.},

In a biologically realistic scenario, however, the FFN should be embedded in a recurrent network, such that the activity in the FFN and the network activity may dynamically interact. Previously, transient synchrony propagating in an FFN was found to destabilize the dynamics of the embedding network (Mehring et al., 2003). Here, we show that by modeling synapses as conductance transients, rather than current sources, it is possible to embed and propagate transient synchrony in the FFN, without destabilizing the background network dynamics. However, the network activity has a strong impact on the type of activity that can be propagated in the embedded FFN. Global synchrony and high firing rates in the embedding network prohibit the propagation of both, synchronous and asynchronous spiking activity. In contrast, asynchronous low-rate network states support the propagation of both, synchronous spiking and asynchronous, but only low firing rates. In either case, spiking activity tends to synchronize as it propagates, challenging the feasibility to transmit information in asynchronous firing rates. Finally, asynchronous network activity allows to embed more than one FFN, with the amount of cross talk depending on the degree of overlap in the FFNs. This opens the possibility of computational mechanisms using transient synchrony among the activities in multiple FFNs.},

In this study, we compared the precision, reliability, and information content of spike trains from X- and Y-cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and layer IV simple cells of area 17 in the cat. To a stochastic, contrast-modulated Gabor patch, layer IV simple cells responded as precisely as their primary inputs, LGN X-cells, but less reliably. LGN Y-cells were more precise and reliable than LGN X-cells. Also, within each LGN cell type, 1) responses to the same stimulus were nearly identical if they shared the same center sign and 2) responses of neurons with the same center sign were nearly identical to the responses of neurons of opposite center sign if the stimulus’ contrasts were inverted. These results suggest simple cells receive highly precise and synchronous LGN input, resulting in precise responses. Nonetheless, the response precision of simple cells was greater than expected. Finally, information-theoretic calculations of our cell responses revealed that 1) LGN X-cells encoded information at half the rate of LGN Y-cells but 2.5 times the rate of layer IV simple cells; 2) LGN cells encoded information in their responses using temporal patterns, whereas simple cells did not; and 3) simple cells used more of their information capacity than LGN X-cells. We propose mechanisms that simple cells might use to ensure high precision.},

abstract = {Object recognition is traditionally viewed as a hierarchical, bottom-up neural process. This view has been challenged recently by theoretical models and by findings indicating that top-down processes are involved in facilitating recognition. However, how such high-level information can be activated quickly enough to facilitate the bottom-up processing is yet unknown. We propose that such top-down facilitation is triggered by magnocellular information projected early and rapidly to the orbitofrontal cortex. Using human neuroimaging, we show that stimuli designed to bias processing toward the magnocellular pathway differentially activated the orbitofrontal cortex compared with parvocellular-biased stimuli. Although the magnocellular stimuli had a lower contrast than the parvocellular stimuli, they were recognized faster and just as accurately. Moreover, orbitofrontal activity predicted the performance advantage for the magnocellular, but not for the parvocellular-biased, stimuli, whereas the opposite was true in the fusiform gyrus. Last, analyses of effective connectivity using dynamic causal modeling showed that magnocellular-biased stimuli significantly activated pathways from occipital visual cortex to orbitofrontal cortex and from orbitofrontal cortex to fusiform gyrus. Conversely, parvocellular-biased stimuli significantly activated a pathway from the occipital visual cortex to fusiform gyrus. Our findings support the proposal that fast magnocellular projections linking early visual and inferotemporal object recognition regions with the orbitofrontal cortex facilitate object recognition by enabling the generation of early predictions.},

We found that cells for which the direction selectivity does not depend on texture motion occur mainly in layer 4 and in the infragranular layers. Cells with only pseudomodulation of direction selectivity were found throughout the cortical depth. Cells for which direction selectivity was abolished when both patterns moved inphase occur outside layer 4 and therefore represent a higher processing stage. These 3 types differ not only in laminar position but also in velocity selectivity and in strength of texture response. These findings suggest that the 3 classes represent distinct physiological types of neurons dedicated to different stages of motion processing which takes place in V5, and suggest that these cells may play different roles in the guidance of eye movements.},

The reticulothalamic input footprints to the ventral posterior lateral nucleus neurons consisted of small, single, topographically organized elliptical regions in a tier away from the reticulothalamic border. In contrast, those to the posterior nucleus were complicated and varied considerably among neurons: although almost all contained a single elliptical region near the reticulothalamic border, in most cases, they consisted of additional discontinuous regions or relatively diffuse regions throughout the thickness of the thalamic reticular nucleus. Our results suggest two sources of reticular inputs to the posterior nucleus neurons: one that is relatively topographic from regions near the reticulothalamic border and one that is relatively diffuse and convergent from most or all of the thickness of the thalamic reticular nucleus. We propose that the more topographic reticular input is the basis of local inhibition seen in posterior nucleus neurons and that the more diffuse and convergent input may represent circuitry through which the ventral posterior lateral and posterior nuclei interact.},

The TRN, therefore, is in a strategic location to regulate thalamocortical communication. We recorded neurons of the somatosensory region of the TRN in a thalamocortical slice preparation and studied the spatial organization of their thalamic input using laser scanning photostimulation. We show that the thalamoreticular pathway is organized topographically for most neurons. The somatosensory region of the TRN can be organized into three tiers. From the inner (thalamoreticular) border to the outer, in a manner roughly reciprocal to the reticulothalamic pathway, each of these tiers receives its input from one of the somatosensory relays of the thalamus--the posterior medial, ventroposterior medial, and ventroposterior lateral nuclei. What is surprising is that approximately a quarter of the recorded neurons received input from multiple thalamic regions usually located in different nuclei. These neurons distribute evenly throughout the thickness of the TRN. Our results, therefore, suggest that there exist a subpopulation of TRN neurons that receive convergent inputs from multiple thalamic sources and engage in more complex patterns of inhibition of relay cells. We propose these neurons enable the TRN to act as an externally driven “searchlight” that integrates cortical and subcortical inputs and then inhibits or disinhibits specific thalamic relay cells, so that appropriate information can get through the thalamus to the cortex.},

Using brain slices, we studied the effects of Group I (dihydroxyphenylglycine) and Group II ((2S,2’R,3’R)-2-(2’,3’-dicarboxycyclopropyl)glycine) mGluR agonists on retinogeniculate synapses. We showed that both agonists inhibit retinogeniculate excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) through presynaptic mechanisms, and their effects are additive and independent. We also found high-frequency stimulation of the layer 6 corticothalamic input produced a similar suppression of retinogeniculate EPSCs, suggesting layer 6 projection to LGN as a plausible source of activating these presynaptic mGluRs.},

VA/VL and the earlier studied somatosensory thalamic nuclei are considered “core” nuclei with topographic thalamocortical projections, whereas CL is thought to be a “matrix” nucleus with diffuse thalamocortical projections. We found that the TRN input footprints to VA/VL and CL are spatially localized and topographic and generally conform to the patterns established earlier for the TRN projections to sensory thalamic relays. These remarkable similarities suggest similar organization of reticulothalamic pathways and TRN regulation of thalamocortical communication for motor and sensory systems and perhaps also for core and matrix thalamus.

abstract = {The activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex of the awake macaque monkey was recorded while the animals were viewing full screen arrays of either oriented line segments or moving random dots. A square patch of the screen was made to perceptually pop out as a circumscribed figure by virtue of differences between the orientation or the direction of motion of the texture elements within that patch and the surround. The animals were trained to identify the figure patches by making saccadic eye movements towards their positions. Almost every cell gave a significantly larger response to elements belonging to the figure than to similar elements belonging to the background. The figure-ground response enhancement was present along the entire extent of the patch and was absent as soon as the receptive field was outside the patch. The strength of the effect had no relation with classical receptive field properties like orientation or direction selectivity or receptive field size. The response enhancement had a latency of 30-40 msec relative to the onset of the neuronal response itself. The results show that context modulation within primary visual cortex has a highly sophisticated nature, putting the image features the cells are responding to into their fully evaluated perceptual context.},

The differences between feedforward and recurrent processing could prove pivotal in understanding the distinctions between attentive and pre-attentive vision as well as between conscious and unconscious vision. The feedforward sweep rapidly groups feature constellations that are hardwired in the visual brain, yet is probably incapable of yielding visual awareness; in many cases, recurrent processing is necessary before the features of an object are attentively grouped and the stimulus can enter consciousness.},

Local image elements coded by the RF are put into more global context, however, by means of modulation of the responses of the V1 neurons. Contextual modulation has been shown to follow closely the perceptual interpretation of the scene as a whole. This would suggest that some aspects of contextual modulation can be recorded only in awake and perceiving animals. In this study, multi-unit activity was recorded with implanted electrodes from primary visual cortex of awake, fixating monkeys viewing textured displays in which figure and ground regions were segregated by differences in either orientation or motion. Contextual modulation was isolated from local RF processing, by keeping RF stimulation identical across trials while sampling responses for various positions of the RF relative to figure and ground. Contextual modulation was observed to unfold spatially and temporally in a way that closely resembles the figure-ground percept. When recording was repeated, but with the animals anesthetized, the figure-ground related modulatory activity was selectively suppressed. RF tuning properties, however, remained unaffected. The results show that the modulatory activity is functionally distinct from the RF properties. V1 thus hosts distinct regimes of activity that are mediated by separate mechanisms and that depend differentially on the animal being awake or anesthetized.},

abstract = {In the search for the neural correlate of visual awareness, much controversy exists about the role of primary visual cortex. Here, the neurophysiological data from V1 recordings in awake monkeys are examined in light of two general classes of models of visual awareness. In the first model type, visual awareness is seen as being mediated either by a particular set of areas or pathways, or alternatively by a specific set of neurons. In these models, the role of V1 seems rather limited, as the mere activity of V1 cells seems insufficient to mediate awareness. In the second model type, awareness is hypothesized to be mediated by a global mechanism, i.e. a specific kind of activity not linked to a particular area or cell type. Two separate versions of global models are discussed, synchronous oscillations and spike rate modulations. It is shown that V1 synchrony does not reflect perception but rather the horizontal connections between neurons, indicating that V1 synchrony cannot be a direct neural correlate of conscious percepts. However, the rate of spike discharges of V1 neurons is strongly modulated by perceptual context, and these modulations correlate very well with aspects of perceptual organization, visual awareness, and attention. If these modulations serve as a neural correlate of visual awareness, then V1 contributes to that neural correlate. Whether V1 plays a role in the neural correlate of visual awareness thus strongly depends on the way visual awareness is hypothesized to be implemented in the brain.},

In the past, we have shown that in V1, modulations of neural activity that are specifically related to figure-ground segregation can be recorded. Here, we recorded from awake macaque monkeys, engaged in a task where they had to detect figures from background in a pattern backward masking paradigm. We show that the V1 figure-ground signals are selectively and fully suppressed at target-mask intervals that psychophysically result in the target being invisible. Initial response transients, signalling the features that make up the scene, are not affected. As figure-ground modulations depend on feedback from extrastriate areas, these results suggest that masking selectively interrupts the recurrent interactions between V1 and higher visual areas.},

The mechanism is robustly triggered by coincident input to opposite poles of the neuron, is exquisitely matched to the large- and fine-scale architecture of the cortex, and is tightly controlled by local microcircuits of inhibitory neurons targeting subcellular compartments.

Here we directly measured passive and active properties of the apical dendrites of L2/3 neurons in rat brain slices using dual dendritic-somatic patch-clamp recordings and calcium imaging. Unlike L5 cells, L2/3 dendrites displayed little sag in response to long current pulses, which suggests a low density of I(h) in the dendrites and soma. This was also consistent with a slight increase in input resistance with distance from the soma. Brief current injections into the apical dendrite evoked relatively short (half-width 2-4 ms) dendritic spikes that were isolated from the soma for near-threshold currents at sites beyond the middle of the apical dendrite. Regenerative dendritic potentials and large concomitant calcium transients were also elicited by trains of somatic action potentials (APs) above a critical frequency (130 Hz), which was slightly higher than in L5 neurons. Initiation of dendritic spikes was facilitated by backpropagating somatic APs and could cause an additional AP at the soma. As in L5 neurons, we found that distal dendritic calcium transients are sensitive to a long-lasting block by GABAergic inhibition. We conclude that L2/3 pyramidal neurons can generate dendritic spikes, sharing with L5 pyramidal neurons fundamental properties of dendritic excitability and control by inhibition.},

They are also unusual in having both an axonal and a dendritic zone for the initiation of action potentials. Distal dendritic inputs, which normally appear greatly attenuated at the axon, must cross a high threshold at the dendritic initiation zone to evoke calcium action potentials but can then generate bursts of axonal action potentials. Here we show that a single back-propagating sodium action potential generated in the axon facilitates the initiation of these calcium action potentials when it coincides with distal dendritic input within a time window of several milliseconds. Inhibitory dendritic input can selectively block the initiation of dendritic calcium action potentials, preventing bursts of axonal action potentials. Thus, excitatory and inhibitory postsynaptic potentials arising in the distal dendrites can exert significantly greater control over action potential initiation in the axon than would be expected from their electrotonically isolated locations. The coincidence of a single back-propagating action potential with a subthreshold distal excitatory postsynaptic potential to evoke a burst of axonal action potentials represents a new mechanism by which the main cortical output neurons can associate inputs arriving at different cortical layers.},

abstract = {Second-order textures-patterns that cannot be detected by mechanisms sensitive only to luminance changes-are ubiquitous in visual scenes, but the neuronal mechanisms mediating perception of such stimuli are not well understood. We used an adaptation protocol to measure neural activity in the human brain selective for the orientation of second-order textures. Functional MRI (fMRI) responses were measured in three subjects to presentations of first- and second-order probe gratings after adapting to a high-contrast first- or second-order grating that was either parallel or orthogonal to the probe gratings. First-order (LM) stimuli were generated by modulating the stimulus luminance. Second-order stimuli were generated by modulating the contrast (CM) or orientation (OM) of a first-order carrier. We used four combinations of adapter and probe stimuli: LM:LM, CM:CM, OM:OM, and LM:OM. The fourth condition tested for cross-modal adaptation with first-order adapter and second-order probe stimuli. Attention was diverted from the stimulus by a demanding task at fixation. Both first- and second-order stimuli elicited orientation-selective adaptation in multiple cortical visual areas, including V1, V2, V3, V3A/B, a newly identified visual area anterior to dorsal V3 that we have termed LO1, hV4, and VO1. For first-order stimuli (condition LM:LM), the adaptation was no larger in extrastriate areas than in V1, implying that the orientation-selective first-order (luminance) adaptation originated in V1. For second-order stimuli (conditions CM:CM and OM:OM), the magnitude of adaptation, relative to the absolute response magnitude, was significantly larger in VO1 (and for condition CM:CM, also in V3A/B and LO1) than in V1, suggesting that second-order stimulus orientation was extracted by additional processing after V1. There was little difference in the amplitude of adaptation between the second-order conditions. No consistent effect of adaptation was found in the cross-modal condition LM:OM, in agreement with psychophysical evidence for weak interactions between first- and second-order stimuli and computational models of separate mechanisms for first- and second-order visual processing.},

During training, improved behavioral sensitivity to weak motion signals was accompanied by changes in motion-driven responses of neurons in LIP, but not in MT. The time course and magnitude of the changes in LIP correlated with the changes in behavioral sensitivity throughout training.

We modeled performance on the basis of the readout of simulated responses of direction-selective sensory neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of monkey cortex. A reward prediction error guided changes in connections between these sensory neurons and the decision process, first establishing the association between motion direction and response direction, and then gradually improving perceptual sensitivity by selectively strengthening the connections from the most sensitive neurons in the sensory population.

In response, we suggested that when Bayesian inference is grounded in its neural instantiation-namely, predictive coding-many features of autistic perception can be attributed to aberrant precision (or beliefs about precision) within the context of hierarchical message passing in the brain (Friston et al., 2013). Here, we unpack the aberrant precision account of autism. Specifically, we consider how empirical findings-that speak directly or indirectly to neurobiological mechanisms-are consistent with the aberrant encoding of precision in autism; in particular, an imbalance of the precision ascribed to sensory evidence relative to prior beliefs.},

abstract = {Evidence from human and primate studies suggests that fast visual processing may utilize signals projecting from primary visual cortex (V1) through the dorsal stream, to area V5/MT+ or beyond and subsequently back into V1. This coincides with the arrival of parvocellular signals en route to the ventral pathway and infero-temporal cortex. Such evidence suggests that the dorsal stream region V5/MT+ is activated rapidly through the traditional hierarchical pathway, and also via a less well established direct signal to V5/MT+ bypassing V1. To test this sixteen healthy humans underwent Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS) of V1/V2 and V5/MT+ whilst performing a motion direction detection task. A three-alternate forced-choice design (left/right motion, stationary) allowed analysis of the quality of errors made, in addition to the more usual performance measures. Transient disruption of V1/V2 and V5/MT+ significantly reduced accuracy when TMS was applied at or near motion onset. Most participants also showed disrupted performance with TMS application over V1/V2 approximately 125ms post motion onset, and significantly reduced accuracy at 158ms with V5/MT+ stimulation. The two periods of disruption with V1/V2 TMS is suggestive of feedforward/feedback models, though the earlier period of disruption has not been reported in previous TMS studies. Very early activation of V5/MT+, evidenced by diminished accuracy and reduced perception of motion following TMS may be indicative of a thalamic-extrastriate pathway, in addition to the traditionally expected later period of processing. A profound disruption of performance pre-stimulus onset is more likely to reflect disruption of top-down expectancy than disruption of visual processing.},

abstract = {Determining whether a region belongs to the interior or exterior of a shape (figure-ground segregation) is a core competency of the primate brain, yet the underlying mechanisms are not well understood. Many models assume that figure-ground segregation occurs by assembling progressively more complex representations through feedforward connections, with feedback playing only a modulatory role. We present a dynamical model of figure-ground segregation in the primate ventral stream wherein feedback plays a crucial role in disambiguating a figure’s interior and exterior. We introduce a processing strategy whereby jitter in RF center locations and variation in RF sizes is exploited to enhance and suppress neural activity inside and outside of figures, respectively. Feedforward projections emanate from units that model cells in V4 known to respond to the curvature of boundary contours (curved contour cells), and feedback projections from units predicted to exist in IT that strategically group neurons with different RF sizes and RF center locations (teardrop cells). Neurons (convex cells) that preferentially respond when centered on a figure dynamically balance feedforward (bottom-up) information and feedback from higher visual areas. The activation is enhanced when an interior portion of a figure is in the RF via feedback from units that detect closure in the boundary contours of a figure. Our model produces maximal activity along the medial axis of well-known figures with and without concavities, and inside algorithmically generated shapes. Our results suggest that the dynamic balancing of feedforward signals with the specific feedback mechanisms proposed by the model is crucial for figure-ground segregation.},

abstract = {Neurophysiological, neuroimaging, and lesion studies point to a highly distributed processing of temporal information by cortico-basal ganglia-thalamic networks. However, there are virtually no experimental data on the encoding of behavioral time by simultaneously recorded cortical ensembles. We predicted temporal intervals from the activity of hundreds of neurons recorded in motor and premotor cortex as rhesus monkeys performed self-timed hand movements. During the delay periods, when animals had to estimate temporal intervals and prepare hand movements, neuronal ensemble activity encoded both the time that elapsed from the previous hand movement and the time until the onset of the next. The neurons that were most informative of these temporal intervals increased or decreased their rates throughout the delay until reaching a threshold value, at which point a movement was initiated. Variability in the self-timed delays was explainable by the variability of neuronal rates, but not of the threshold. In addition to predicting temporal intervals, the same neuronal ensemble activity was informative for generating predictions that dissociated the delay periods of the task from the movement periods. Left hemispheric areas were the best source of predictions in one bilaterally implanted monkey overtrained to perform the task with the right hand. However, after that monkey learned to perform the task with the left hand, its left hemisphere continued and the right hemisphere started contributing to the prediction. We suggest that decoding of temporal intervals from bilaterally recorded cortical ensembles could improve the performance of neural prostheses for restoration of motor function.},

To characterize the introduction of such extraretinal signal into the human visual system, we performed a factorial, functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, in which we manipulated the factor eye movement, with “fixation” and “pursuit” as levels, and the factor task, with “speed” and “form” judgments as levels. We hypothesized that the extraretinal speed signal is reflected as an interaction between speed judgments and pursuit. Random effects analysis yielded an interaction only in dorsal early visual cortex. Retinotopic mapping localized this interaction on the horizontal meridian (HM) between dorsal areas visual 2 and 3 (V2/V3) at 1-2 degrees azimuth. This corresponded to the position the pursuit target would have reached, if moving retinotopically, at the time of the subject’s speed judgment. Because the 2 V2/V3 HMs are redundant, both may be involved in speed judgments, the ventral one involving judgments based on retinal motion and the dorsal one judgments requiring an internal signal. These results indicate that an extraretinal speed signal is injected into early visual cortex during pursuit.},

To learn whether spatial phase is a mediating variable, we measured thresholds for detection of contrast modulation over time among component gratings while manipulating spatial phase among those components. In Experiment 1, observers more easily detected correlated contrast modulation when two component gratings were aligned in peaks-subtract phase. Experiment 2 showed that this phase-dependent detectability of synchronized contrast modulation is mediated by the phase-dependent, non-linear interaction among spatial frequency channels. The rigorous evaluation of several a priori reasonable hypotheses indicates that the phase-dependent detectability is not based on local spatial features such as local luminance, contrast or luminance gradient. Taken together, our results indicate that the spatial phase relationship and the temporal correlation of contrast modulation of two component gratings are both important for triggering facilitatory interaction between neural analyzers tuned to those gratings.},

When orientation was completely random (no spatial `path’ cue) temporal synchrony still supported reliable performance, but only when correlation of change among `path’ elements was high. When combined, these two weak spatial and temporal structures yielded performance in excess of probability summation: `paths’ weakly defined by orientation were highly conspicuous when the constituent Gabors underwent synchronized changes in direction of motion, even though the individual directions of path elements were uncorrelated. Spatial grouping from temporal structure may arise from correlated transients associated with synchronized changes in motion direction. Evidently these two mechanisms for promotion of spatial grouping interact synergistically},

Interestingly, receptive field properties of cortical layer 6 neurons are different from those in layer 4.

To distinguish between these possibilities, we utilized in vitro slice preparations containing the thalamocortical pathways in the auditory and somatosensory systems. Responses from neurons in layers 4 and 6 that resided in the same column were recorded using whole-cell patch clamp. Laser-scanning photostimulation via uncaging of glutamate in the thalamus and cortex was used to map the functional topography of thalamocortical and intracortical inputs to each layer. In addition, we assessed the functional divergence of thalamocortical inputs by optical imaging of flavoprotein autofluorescence. We found that the thalamocortical inputs to layers 4 and 6 originated from the same thalamic domain, but the intracortical projections to the same neurons differed dramatically. Our results suggest that the intracortical projections, rather than the thalamic inputs, to each layer contribute more to the differences in their receptive field properties.},

abstract = {Effects of saccades on individual neurons in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) were examined under two conditions: during spontaneous saccades in the dark and during stimulation by large, uniform flashes delivered at various times during and after rewarded saccades made to small visual targets. In the dark condition, a suppression of activity began 200-300 ms before saccade start, peaked approximately 100 ms before saccade start, and smoothly reversed to a facilitation of activity by saccade end. The facilitation peaked 70-130 ms after saccade end and decayed during the next several hundred milliseconds. The latency of the facilitation was related inversely to saccade velocity, reaching a minimum for saccades with peak velocity >70-80 degrees /s. Effects of saccades on visually evoked activity were remarkably similar: a facilitation began at saccade end and peaked 50-100 ms later. When matched for saccade velocity, the time courses and magnitudes of postsaccadic facilitation for activity in the dark and during visual stimulation were identical. The presaccadic suppression observed in the dark condition was similar for X and Y cells, whereas the postsaccadic facilitation was substantially stronger for X cells, both in the dark and for visually evoked responses. This saccade-related regulation of geniculate transmission appears to be independent of the conditions under which the saccade is evoked or the state of retinal input to the LGN. The change in activity from presaccadic suppression to postsaccadic facilitation amounted to an increase in gain of geniculate transmission of approximately 30%. This may promote rapid central registration of visual inputs by increasing the temporal contrast between activity evoked by an image near the end of a fixation and that evoked by the image immediately after a saccade.},

Some observations suggest that attention preferentially enhances responses to low contrast stimuli, whereas others suggest that attention proportionally affects responses to all stimuli. Resolving how attention affects responses to different stimuli is essential for understanding the mechanism by which it acts. To explore the effects of attention on stimuli of different contrasts, we recorded from individual neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) of rhesus monkeys while shifting their attention between preferred and nonpreferred stimuli within their receptive fields. This configuration results in robust attentional modulation that makes it possible to readily distinguish whether attention acts preferentially on low contrast stimuli. We found no evidence for greater enhancement of low contrast stimuli. Instead, the strong attentional modulations were well explained by a model in which attention proportionally enhances responses to stimuli of all contrasts. These data, together with observations on the effects of attention on responses to other stimulus dimensions, suggest that the primary effect of attention in visual cortex may be to simply increase the strength of responses to all stimuli by the same proportion.},

abstract = {Traditional views of visual processing suggest that early visual neurons in areas V1 and V2 are static spatiotemporal filters that extract local features from a visual scene.

Recent electrophysiological recordings from early visual neurons in awake behaving monkeys reveal that there are many levels of complexity in the information processing of the early visual cortex, as seen in the long-latency responses of its neurons. These new findings suggest that activity in the early visual cortex is tightly coupled and highly interactive with the rest of the visual system. They lead us to propose a new theoretical setting based on the mathematical framework of hierarchical Bayesian inference for reasoning about the visual system. In this framework, the recurrent feedforward/feedback loops in the cortex serve to integrate top-down contextual priors and bottom-up observations so as to implement concurrent probabilistic inference along the visual hierarchy. We suggest that the algorithms of particle filtering and Bayesian-belief propagation might model these interactive cortical computations. We review some recent neurophysiological evidences that support the plausibility of these ideas.},

This response largely involves a K(+) conductance mediated by G-protein activity and GIRK channels. Furthermore, electrical and photostimulation of the intracortical inputs to layer 4 elicits a similar hyperpolarization that is blocked by group II mGluR antagonists. This novel inhibition mediated by group II mGluRs may be an unappreciated mechanism for refining cortical receptive fields in layer 4 and may enable synaptic gain control during periods of high activity.},

However, people seldom play such optimal strategies and adjust their strategies based on their experience. Accordingly, many theories postulate a set of variables related to the probabilities of choosing various strategies and describe how such variables are dynamically updated. In reinforcement learning, these value functions are updated based on the outcome of the player’s choice, whereas belief learning allows the value functions of all available choices to be updated according to the choices of other players. We investigated the nature of learning process in monkeys playing a competitive game with ternary choices, using a rock-paper-scissors game. During the baseline condition in which the computer selected its targets randomly, each animal displayed biases towards some targets. When the computer exploited the pattern of animal’s choice sequence but not its reward history, the animal’s choice was still systematically biased by the previous choice of the computer. This bias was reduced when the computer exploited both the choice and reward histories of the animal. Compared to simple models of reinforcement learning or belief learning, these adaptive processes were better described by a model that incorporated the features of both models. These results suggest that stochastic decision-making strategies in primates during social interactions might be adjusted according to both actual and hypothetical payoffs.},

Most clusters are elongated narrowly along functional modules within the plane of the TRN, with axons that selectively inhibit local groups of relay neurons. However, some coupled clusters have neurons arrayed across the thickness of the TRN and target their axons to both first- and higher-order relay nuclei.

abstract = {The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) provides inhibitory innervation to most thalamic relay nuclei and receives excitatory innervation from both cortical and thalamic neurons. Ultimately, information transfer through the thalamus to the neocortex is strongly influenced by TRN. In addition, the reciprocal synaptic connectivity between TRN with associated thalamic relay nuclei is critical in generating intrathalamic rhythmic activities that occur during certain arousal states and pathophysiological conditions. Despite evidence suggesting morphological heterogeneity amongst TRN neurons, the heterogeneity of intrinsic properties of TRN neurons has not been systematically examined. One key characteristic of virtually all thalamic neurons is the ability to produce action potentials in two distinct modes: burst and tonic. In this study, we have examined the prevalence of burst discharge within TRN neurons. Our intracellular recordings revealed that TRN neurons can be differentiated by their action potential discharge modes. The majority of neurons in the dorsal TRN (56%) lack burst discharge, and the remaining neurons (35%) show an atypical burst that consists of an initial action potential followed by small amplitude, long duration depolarizations. In contrast, most neurons in ventral TRN (82%) display a stereotypical burst discharge consisting of a transient, high frequency discharge of multiple action potentials. TRN neurons that lack burst discharge typically did not produce low threshold calcium spikes or produced a significantly reduced transient depolarization. Our findings clearly indicate that TRN neurons can be differentiated by differences in their spike discharge properties and these subtypes are not uniformly distributed within TRN. The functional consequences of such intrinsic differences may play an important role in modality-specific thalamocortical information transfer as well as overall circuit level activities.},

In six instances cross correlograms of ganglion cell and cortical cell activity showed that the ganglion cell was afferent, via a relay cell in the LGN, to the cortical neurone. The receptive fields of such pairs were almost completely overlapping and concentric. In three cases a sustained ganglion cell projected to a simple cortical cell. In one case a transient ganglion cell projected to a simple cell, and in one case a sustained and a transient ganglion cell projected to the same simple cell.},

Based on theoretical reasoning and the experimental evidence, we propose a possible reinterpretation of the functional role of V1. In this framework, because of V1 neurons’ precise encoding of orientation and spatial information, higher level perceptual computations and representations that involve high resolution details, fine geometry and spatial precision would necessarily involve V1 and be reflected in the later part of its neurons’ activities.},

abstract = {PURPOSE: Our objective was to examine the feasibility of rotating choriocapillaris, Bruch’s membrane (BM), and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) through 180 degrees on a vascular pedicle and to assess revascularization and tissue preservation postoperatively. Such an approach could be used in the treatment of age-related macular degeneration where there is focal disease at the macula with healthy tissues located peripherally. METHODS: Successful surgery was performed in six rhesus macaque monkeys, which have a very similar choroidal blood supply to humans. After inducing a retinal detachment, the recurrent branch of the long posterior ciliary artery was used as a pedicle around which a graft stretching to the temporal equator was rotated. Retina was reattached over the rotated graft and eyes were followed up for up to 6 months with repeated angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT). The morphology of retinal cells and BM were assessed by immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy. RESULTS: Revascularization of the choroid was limited, with reestablishment of drainage to the vortex veins seen in only one case. There was a secondary loss of the RPE and outer retina evident on histological analysis three months after surgery. The underlying BM however remained intact. CONCLUSIONS: Pedicled choroidal rotation surgery is technically feasible in vivo with intraoperative control of bleeding. However, lack of graft revascularization with the technique in its current form leads to neuroretinal and RPE tissue loss, and graft shrinkage. We found no evidence that rotational grafts are likely to improve the outcomes presently achieved with free graft techniques.},

Attention and stimulus contrast both modulate the magnitude of neuronal responses. However, changes in stimulus contrast also affect the latency of visual responses. Although many neurophysiological studies have examined how attention affects the strength of neuronal responses, few have considered whether attention affects neuronal latencies. To compare directly the effects of stimulus contrast and attention, we recorded responses from individual neurons in area V4 of macaque monkeys while they performed a task that independently controlled spatial attention and stimulus contrast. As expected, changes in stimulus contrast affected both the magnitude and latency of neuronal responses. Although attention had the expected effects on the magnitudes of neuronal responses, we did not detect statistically reliable changes in neuronal latency. A direct comparison of the effects of contrast and attention revealed a reliable difference. When a shift in spatial attention decreased response magnitude, response latency increased much less than when the same magnitude change was caused by reducing stimulus contrast. Thus, attention is distinct from contrast in the way it affects the relationship between neuronal response magnitude and latency.},

TRN bursts are believed to be critical for generation and maintenance of thalamocortical oscillations, leading to the spike-and-wave discharges (SWDs), which are the hallmarks of absence seizures. We observed that the RBDs were completely abolished, whereas tonic firing was significantly increased, in TRN neurons from mice in which the gene for the T-type Ca(2+) channel, CaV3.3, was deleted (CaV3.3(-/-)). Contrary to expectations, there was an increased susceptibility to drug-induced SWDs both in CaV3.3(-/-) mice and in mice in which the CaV3.3 gene was silenced predominantly in the TRN. CaV3.3(-/-) mice also showed enhanced inhibitory synaptic drive onto TC neurons. Finally, a double knockout of both CaV3.3 and CaV3.2, which showed complete elimination of burst firing and RBDs in TRN neurons, also displayed enhanced drug-induced SWDs and absence seizures. On the other hand, tonic firing in the TRN was increased in these mice, suggesting that increased tonic firing in the TRN may be sufficient for drug-induced SWD generation in the absence of burst firing. These results call into question the role of burst firing in TRN neurons in the genesis of SWDs, calling for a rethinking of the mechanism for absence seizure induction.},

abstract = {We have studied the responses of ganglion cells in the macaque retina to stimuli that alternate in color. With most color combinations, the phasic retinal ganglion cells, which sum input from M- and L-cones in both center and surround, showed a response with twice the alternation frequency at equal luminance. This frequency doubling was directly related to the degree to which the M- and L-cones were stimulated out-of-phase with one another, and thus varied with the wavelength combinations used. It was absent with wavelength combinations that lay along tritanopic confusion lines, when at equal luminance the M- and L-cones are not modulated. Such a frequency-doubled response is evidence for a nonlinearity at or before M- and L-cone summation. The effect became much smaller or was abolished when the receptive field center alone was stimulated, indicating that its mechanism lies in the surround or in a center-surround interaction. Also, it was much more marked at high luminance levels, being almost absent at retinal illuminances below 100 td. Its origin is not clear, but it seems to derive more from the L- than the M-cone. The results imply that phasic cells, through this nonlinearity, could respond to the red-green equal luminance borders used in some psychophysical experiments.},

abstract = {Probability distributions of macaque complex cell responses to a large set of images were determined. Measures of selectivity were based on the overall shape of the response probability distribution, as quantified by either kurtosis or entropy. We call this non-parametric selectivity, in contrast to parametric selectivity, which measures tuning curve bandwidths. To examine how receptive field properties affected non-parametric selectivity, two models of complex cells were created. One was a standard Gabor energy model, and the other a slight variant constructed from a Gabor function and its Hilbert transform. Functionally, these models differed primarily in the size of their DC responses. The Hilbert model produced higher selectivities than the Gabor model, with the two models bracketing the data from above and below. Thus we see that tiny changes in the receptive field profiles can lead to major changes in selectivity. While selectivity looks at the response distribution of a single neuron across a set of stimuli, sparseness looks at the response distribution of a population of neurons to a single stimulus. In the model, we found that on average the sparseness of a population was equal to the selectivity of cells comprising that population, a property we call ergodicity. We raise the possibility that high sparseness is the result of distortions in the shape of response distributions caused by non-linear, information-losing transforms, unrelated to information theoretic issues of efficient coding.},

abstract = {We have characterized selectivity and sparseness in anterior inferotemporal cortex, using a large data set. Responses were collected from 674 monkey inferotemporal cells, each stimulated by 806 object photographs. This 806 × 674 matrix was examined in two ways: columnwise, looking at responses of a single neuron to all images (single-neuron selectivity), and rowwise, looking at the responses of all neurons caused by a single image (population sparseness). Selectivity and sparseness were measured as kurtosis of probability distributions. Population sparseness exceeded single-neuron selectivity, with specific values dependent on the size of the data sample. This difference was principally caused by inclusion, within the population, of neurons with a variety of dynamic ranges (standard deviations of responses over all images). Statistics of large responses were examined by quantifying how quickly the upper tail of the probability distribution decreased (tail heaviness). This analysis demonstrated that population responses had heavier tails than single-neuron responses, consistent with the difference between sparseness and selectivity measurements. Population responses with spontaneous activity subtracted had the heaviest tails, following a power law. The very light tails of single-neuron responses indicate that the critical feature for each neuron is simple enough to have a high probability of occurring within a limited stimulus set. Heavy tails of population responses indicate that there are a large number of different critical features to which different neurons are tuned. These results are inconsistent with some structural models of object recognition that posit that objects are decomposed into a small number of standard features.},

Our final dimensionality estimate was 93 (SD: ± 11), indicating that there is basis set of approximately 100 independent features that characterize the dimensions of neural object space. We believe this is the first estimate of the dimensionality of neural visual representations based on single-cell neurophysiological data. The dimensionality of AIT object representations was much lower than the dimensionality of the stimuli. We suggest that there may be a gradual reduction in the dimensionality of object representations in neural populations going from retina to inferotemporal cortex as receptive fields become increasingly complex.},

The principal postulates of these theories have been confirmed by physiologists (e.g., the existence of three classes of receptors and second-stage mechanisms in which the signals from these receptors are compared), but some important features of the psychophysical scheme have found limited physiological support. One such issue is the absence of the unitary “achromatic” mechanism required by psychophysicists. We know a good deal less about the chromatic analyses that occur beyond these early stages. Although physiologists have devoted much effort to the study of cortical mechanisms, little of this work has been guided by clear ideas of the tasks performed by them. The provision of color constancy and the ability to segment scenes are perhaps the foremost concerns of chromatic mechanisms, and recent psychophysical work bearing on these problems offers physiologists clearer guidance on what to seek with their electrodes.},

Stimuli were represented in a 3-dimensional color space defined by 2 chromatic axes and a third along which luminance varied. With rare exceptions the chromatic properties of cortical neurons were well described by a linear model in which the response of a cell is proportional to the sum (for complex cells, the rectified sum) of the signals from the 3 classes of cones. For each cell there is a vector passing through the white point along which modulation gives rise to a maximal response. The elevation (theta m) and azimuth (phi m) of this vector fully describe the chromatic properties of the cell. The linear model also describes neurons in l.g.n. (Derrington et al., 1984), so most neurons in striate cortex have the same chromatic selectivity as do neurons in l.g.n. However, the distributions of preferred vectors differed in cortex and l.g.n.: Most cortical neurons preferred modulation along vectors lying close to the achromatic axis and those showing overt chromatic opponency did not fall into the clearly defined chromatic groups seen in l.g.n. The neurons most responsive to chromatic modulation (found mainly in layers IVA, IVC beta, and VI) had poor orientation selectivity, and responded to chromatic modulation of a spatially uniform field at least as well as they did to any grating. We encountered neurons with band-pass spatial selectivity for chromatically modulated stimuli in layers II/III and VI. Most had complex receptive fields. Neurons in layer II/III did not fall into distinct groups according to their chromatic sensitivities, and the chromatic properties of neurons known to lie within regions rich in cytochrome oxidase appeared no different from those of neurons in the interstices. Six neurons, all of which resembled simple cells, showed unusually sharp chromatic selectivity.},

While there seems to be wide agreement that the thalamo-cortical system directly intervenes in vigilance and arousal, a divergence of opinion persists regarding its intervention in the control of other cognitive processes necessary for consciousness. In the present manuscript, we provide a review of recent scientific findings on the thalamo-cortical system and its role in the control and regulation of the flow of neural information necessary for conscious cognitive processes. We suggest that the axis formed by the medial prefrontal cortex and different thalamic nuclei (reticular nucleus, intralaminar nucleus, and midline nucleus), represents a core component for consciousness. This axis regulates different cerebral structures which allow basic cognitive processes like attention, arousal and memory to emerge. In order to produce a synchronized coherent response, neural communication between cerebral structures must have exact timing (chronometry). Thus, a chronometric functional sub-network within the thalamo-cortical system keeps us in an optimal and continuous functional state, allowing high-order cognitive processes, essential to awareness and qualia, to take place.},

volume = {4}, 
number = {7}, 
pages = {209}, 
year = {2006}, 
abstract = {In the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus, visual stimulation produces two distinct types of responses known as tonic and burst. Due to the dynamics of the T-type Ca(2+) channels involved in burst generation, the type of response evoked by a particular stimulus depends on the resting membrane potential, which is controlled by a network of modulatory connections from other brain areas. In this study, we use simulated responses to natural scene movies to describe how modulatory and stimulus-driven changes in LGN membrane potential interact to determine the luminance sequences that trigger burst responses. We find that at low resting potentials, when the T channels are de-inactivated and bursts are relatively frequent, an excitatory stimulus transient alone is sufficient to evoke a burst. However, to evoke a burst at high resting potentials, when the T channels are inactivated and bursts are relatively rare, prolonged inhibitory stimulation followed by an excitatory transient is required. We also observe evidence of these effects in vivo, where analysis of experimental recordings demonstrates that the luminance sequences that trigger bursts can vary dramatically with the overall burst percentage of the response. To characterize the functional consequences of the effects of resting potential on burst generation, we simulate LGN responses to different luminance sequences at a range of resting potentials with and without a mechanism for generating bursts. Using analysis based on signal detection theory, we show that bursts enhance detection of specific luminance sequences, ranging from the onset of excitatory sequences at low resting potentials to the offset of inhibitory sequences at high resting potentials. These results suggest a dynamic role for burst responses during visual processing that may change according to behavioral state.},

abstract = {Onset latencies of evoked responses are useful for determining delays in sensory pathways and for indicating spread of activity between brain areas, therefore inferring causality. Previous studies have applied several different methods and parameters for detecting onsets, mainly utilizing thresholds based on the mean and standard deviation (SD) of the pre-stimulus ‚Äúbaseline‚Äù time window, or using t-tests of group data to determine when the response first differs significantly from the baseline. However, these methods are not statistically robust, have low power when the baseline data are not normally distributed, and are heavily influenced by outliers in the baseline. Here, we examine using a modified boxplot method known as the ‚Äúmedian rule‚Äù for determining onset latencies. This rule makes no assumptions about the baseline distribution, is resistant to outliers, and can be applied to individual level data therefore allowing intersubject and interregional comparisons. We first show with simulations that the median rule is significantly less sensitive to outliers in the baseline than the SD method. We then use simulations to demonstrate the effect of skewness on onset latencies. Finally, we use magnetoencephalography (MEG) to show that the median rule can be easily applied to real data and gives reasonable results. In most situations the different methods give similar results, which enhances comparability across studies, but in data sets with a high noise level there is a clear advantage to using a statistically robust method. In conclusion, the median rule is an excellent method for estimating onset latencies in evoked responses.},

Stimuli were brief luminance changes superimposed upon a weak steady pedestal ranging from 27 to 47,000 quanta (507 nm) per second at the cornea. Overall quantum efficiencies of cells ranged up to approximately 13% and were compatible with previous estimates at absolute threshold. The main work was done on on-center cells, but a small sample of off-center units behaved similarly. Experimental ROC curves verified a set of qualitative predictions based on a theoretical treatment of performance, assuming that response variability resulted solely from quantum fluctuations. However, quantitative predictions were not fulfilled. The discrepancy could be resolved by postulating a source of added internal variance, R, the value of which could then be deduced from the experimental measurements. A ganglion cell model limited by a fixed amount of added variance from physiological sources and having access to a fixed fraction of incident quanta can account quantitatively for (a) slopes of ROC curves, (b) variation of detectability with magnitude of both increments and decrements, and (c) performance over a range of pedestal intensities. Estimates of the proportion of incident quanta used ranged up to 29% under some conditions, a figure approximately matching estimates of the fraction of corneal quanta that isomerize rhodopsin in the cat.},

abstract = {The responses of neurons in the visual cortex to stimuli presented within their receptive fields can be markedly modulated by stimuli presented in surrounding regions that do not themselves evoke responses. This modulation depends on the relative orientation and direction of motion of the centre and surround stimuli, and it has been suggested that local cortical circuits linking cells with similar stimulus selectivities underlie these phenomena. However, the functional relevance and nature of these integrative processes remain unclear. Here we investigate how such integration depends on the relative activity levels of neurons at different points across the cortex by varying the relative contrast of stimuli over the receptive field and surrounding regions. We show that simply altering the balance of the excitation driving centre and surround regions can dramatically change the sign and stimulus selectivity of these contextual effects. Thus, the way that single neurons integrate information across the visual field depends not only on the precise form of stimuli at different locations, but also crucially on their relative contrasts. We suggest that these effects reflect a complex gain-control mechanism that regulates cortical neuron responsiveness, which permits dynamic modification of response properties of cortical neurons.},

abstract = {Area V2 of macaque visual cortex represents an important but poorly understood stage in visual processing. To provide a better understanding of the region, we studied the organization of its intrinsic cortical connections by making focal (200-300 microns) iontophoretic microinjections of the tracer biocytin. Alternate tissue sections were tested for biocytin, cytochrome oxidase (CO), or Cat-301 immunoreactivity to localize biocytin label relative to the three stripelike compartments that characterize this area. Biocytin-labeled pyramidal neurons of layers 2/3, and, to a lesser extent, layer 5, provided laterally spreading axon projections that terminated in discrete patches (250-300 microns diameter), primarily in layers 1-3. Any injected locus in V2 projected to 10-15 similarly sized patches, up to 4 mm from the injection site, and distributed in an elongated field orthogonal to the stripe compartments. We noted prominent patchy connections within, as well as between, individual compartments, perhaps reflecting functional substructures within stripes. Each stripe compartment projected to all three compartments but with different relative frequencies; CO-rich compartments projected mainly to other CO-rich compartments (75%), whereas CO-poor compartments projected equally to CO-rich and CO-poor compartments. We therefore emphasize the existence of substantial interconnections among all three V2 compartments. As further evidence for crosstalk between visual channels, we also noted an input to the V2 “thick” CO stripes from V1 cells in layer 4A as a distinct population in addition to the neurons of layer 4B. Thus, the CO stripe architecture may not be a marker for strictly segregated parallel visual pathways through V2.},

We expected that on-center LGN neurons would respond best to gratings combined in positive cosine (bright bar) phase, while off-center LGN neurons would respond best to gratings combined in negative cosine (dark bar) phase. When drifting stimuli were used, cells’ phase preferences were roughly 90 deg away from the expected values; when stationary, contrast-modulated stimuli were used, phase preferences were as originally predicted. Computer simulations showed that this discrepancy could be explained by taking into account the cells’ temporal properties. Thus, tests using drifting stimuli confound the spatial structure of visual neural receptive fields with their temporal response characteristics. A small sample of data from cortical neurons reveals the same confound.},

abstract = {Visual motion perception is one of the most prominent functions performed by the mammalian cerebral cortex. The moving images are commonly considered to be processed in two stages. The first-stage neurons are sensitive to the motion of one-dimensional orientated components, and their outputs are combined at the second stage to perceive the global motion of the whole pattern. Alternatively, the pattern motion may be signalled by monitoring a distinctive feature of the image, such as a line-end or a corner. In the present study, a series of ‘random-line’ patterns were used to measure the direction-tuning responses of 138 neurons in the posteromedial lateral suprasylvian area of the cat. The novel stimuli comprised identical thin line segments, with a length : width ratio no less than 10 : 1, which were moved perpendicularly or obliquely to their common orientation during the recordings. When the component lines were much shorter than the size of receptive field, the majority of cells were selective to the direction of pattern motion while only a small subset was sensitive to the direction of component motion. However, the response profiles of most cells became more component-motion selective with the increment of orientation element in stimulus by elongating the component lines in the patterns. These findings imply that the two-stage theory might be incomplete for modelling the visual motion analysis. Even at relatively low levels of the visual system, some kind of nonorientation-based processing may coexist with the orientation-sensitive processing in a dynamic competition, where one rises as the other falls depending upon the strength of the orientation element in the stimulus, so that under some circumstances it becomes possible to signal the veridical direction of pattern motion.},

A recent study suggested that monoptic COS arises from subcortical processes; however, the mechanisms underlying dichoptic COS were not addressed. We have compared the temporal frequency tuning and stimulus adaptation properties of monoptic and dichoptic COS. We found that dichoptic COS is best elicited with lower temporal frequencies and is substantially reduced after prolonged adaptation to a mask grating. In contrast, monoptic COS is more pronounced with mask gratings at much higher temporal frequencies and is less prone to stimulus adaptation. These results suggest that monoptic COS is mediated by subcortical mechanisms, whereas intracortical inhibition is the mechanism for dichoptic COS.},

The neural mechanism underlying this cross-orientation suppression (COS) may arise from intracortical or subcortical processes or from both. Recent studies of the temporal frequency and adaptation properties of COS suggest that depression at thalamo-cortical synapses may be the principal mechanism. To examine the possible role of synaptic depression in relation to COS, we measured the recovery time course of COS. We find it too rapid to be explained by synaptic depression. We also studied potential subcortical processes by measuring single cell contrast response functions for a population of LGN neurons. In general, contrast saturation is a consistent property of LGN neurons. Combined with rectifying nonlinearities in the LGN and spike threshold nonlinearities in visual cortex, contrast saturation in the LGN can account for most of the COS that is observed in the visual cortex.},

We also show that the same visual contours elicited significantly weaker neuronal responses when they were not detected in the detection task, or when they were unattended.

We silenced intracortical excitatory circuits with optogenetic activation of parvalbumin-positive inhibitory neurons in mouse primary visual cortex and compared visually evoked thalamocortical input with total excitation in the same layer 4 pyramidal neurons. We found that intracortical excitatory circuits preserved the orientation and direction tuning of thalamocortical excitation, with a linear amplification of thalamocortical signals of about threefold. The spatial receptive field of thalamocortical input was slightly elongated and was expanded by intracortical excitation in an approximately proportional manner. Thus, intracortical excitatory circuits faithfully reinforce the representation of thalamocortical information and may influence the size of the receptive field by recruiting additional inputs.},

abstract = {The physiological blind spot, corresponding to the optic disk in the retina, is a relatively large (6 × 8°) area in the visual field that receives no retinal input. However, we rarely notice the existence of it in daily life. This is because the blind spot fills in with the brightness, color, texture, and motion of the surround. The study of filling-in enables us to better understand the creative nature of the visual system, which generates perceptual information where there is none. Is there any retinotopic rule in the color filling-in of the blind spot? To find out, we used mono-colored and bi-colored annuli hugging the boundary of the blind spot. We found that mono-colored annuli filled in the blind spot uniformly. By contrast, bi-colored annuli, where one half had a given color, while the other half had a different one, filled in the blind spot asymmetrically. Specifically, the color surrounding the nasal half typically filled in about 75% of the blind spot area, whereas the color surrounding the temporal half filled in only about 25%. This asymmetry was dependent on the relative size of the half rings, but not the two colors used, and was absent when the bi-colored annulus was rotated by 90°. Here, the two colors on the upper and lower sides of the blind spot filled in the enclosed area equally. These results suggest that the strength of filling-in decreases with distance from the fovea consistent with the decrease of the cortical magnification factor.},

abstract = {The mismatch between the perceived and the physical stimulus is typically regarded as evidence for a visual illusion. The removal of a flashed spot often generates the perception of a negative afterimage. However, where the perception of such a negative afterimage is initiated in the brain remains unclear. It is well-known that ON or OFF centre neurons in dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of visual thalamus respond vigorously to the removal of flashing spot stimuli with opposite signs. Considering recent progresses demonstrating visual thalamus in primates engages heavily in behavioral tasks and higher cognitive functions, we hypothesize the neuronal responses to the removal of a flashed dark or light spot in dLGN may provide the initial foundation for the generation of negative afterimages. In the current study using human psychophysical tests, electrophysiological single-unit and whole-cell recordings of cat dLGN, we found evidence to support such a hypothesis. Specifically, ON centre neurons exhibited higher firing rates with longer response duration in response to the removal of a dark spot than that of OFF centre neurons to the removal of a light spot. These results matched the observation of an asymmetry between opposite sign negative afterimages in our psychophysical experiment, as dark flashed spots generated perceptually stronger and longer afterimages than light flashed spots. Furthermore, we found that dLGN responses also showed a clear size tuning to the removal of a flash spot of various sizes, comparable with our psychophysical test that the observed size of a negative afterimage was determined by the stimulus size. These findings suggest that the negative afterimage of a flashed spot could initiate at least as early as in the dLGN.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of various patterns as contextual stimuli on human orientation discrimination, and on responses of neurons in V1 of alert monkeys. When a target line is presented along with various contextual stimuli (masks), human orientation discrimination is impaired. For most V1 neurons, responses elicited by a line in the receptive field (RF) center are suppressed by these contextual patterns. Orientation discrimination thresholds of human observers are elevated slightly when the target line is surrounded by orthogonal lines. For randomly oriented lines, thresholds are elevated further and even more so for lines parallel to the target. Correspondingly, responses of most V1 neurons to a line are suppressed. Although contextual lines inhibit the amplitude of orientation tuning functions of most V1 neurons, they do not systematically alter the tuning width. Elevation of human orientation discrimination thresholds decreases with increasing curvature of masking lines, so does the inhibition of V1 neuronal responses. A mask made of straight lines yields the strongest interference with human orientation discrimination and produces the strongest suppression of neuronal responses. Elevation of human orientation discrimination thresholds is highest when a mask covers only the immediate vicinity of the target line. Increasing the masking area results in less interference. On the contrary, suppression of neuronal responses in V1 increases with increasing mask size. Our data imply that contextual interference observed in human orientation discrimination is in part directly related to contextual inhibition of neuronal activity in V1. However, the finding that interference with orientation discrimination is weaker for larger masks suggests a figure-ground segregation process that is not located in V1},

We recently reported that responses of most V1 neurons to a line in the CRF center are inhibited by large surround-stimuli and that this modulation is stimulus selective. Here we report that a significant proportion of V1 neurons in alert monkeys respond directly to stimuli outside the CRF with very long latency and much reduced selectivity. When surround stimuli are presented alone, three response patterns can be distinguished in 153 single- or multiunits tested: (1) 31.4% have no significant response; (2) 50.3% show excitatory responses that are significantly higher than spontaneous activity. The average latency of these responses is about 145 ms, 2-3 times longer than center responses; (3) 18.3% show suppressed spontaneous activity after stimulus onset. The direct surround responses are found to be only weakly selective for the orientation of contextual lines, and not selective for other contextual patterns tested. While the outburst of responses to stimuli within the CRF is not affected by reducing stimulus duration from 500 ms to 50 ms, late excitatory surround responses are virtually eliminated. We propose that the late excitatory surround responses to extra-CRF stimulation alone are the reflection of feedback from higher cortical areas and may contribute to reduced contextual inhibition of cells in V1. This could play a role in figure-ground segregation.},

abstract = {Orientation selectivity is an important emergent property of neurons in the primary visual cortex, and inhibition is thought to play an important role in establishing this selectivity. But the relationship between strength of inhibition and orientation selectivity is unclear. To investigate this relationship, we electrophoretically applied the inhibitory transmitter GABA and the GABA(A) antagonist bicuculline on the same individual area 17 neurons in anesthetized cats. Neurons were classified as weakly orientation-selective, moderately orientation-selective, or strongly orientation-selective, according to the values of an orientation bias index. Orientation bias, half-width of the tuning curve at half-height and an orientation-specificity index (orthogonal to optimal ratio) were compared with or without GABA and bicuculline administration. GABA improved orientation selectivity with the greatest effects on weakly orientation-selective cells, smaller effects on moderately orientation-selective cells, and minimal effects on strongly orientation-selective cells; bicuculline diminished orientation selectivity the most on moderately and strongly orientation-selective cells, with minimal effects on weakly orientation-selective cells. We also found that orientation selectivity correlated with the level of neurons’ spontaneous activity. These results suggest that the degree of orientation selectivity of an area 17 neuron correlates with its endogenous inhibition strength, and that GABAergic inhibition can bi-directionally regulate orientation selectivity. This correlation indicates that GABA-mediated inhibition plays an important role in establishing sharp orientation selectivity of individual neurons.},

For example, it is unclear whether the different information channels have the same or distinct contrast adaptation properties and mechanisms. It has been recognized that the visual system is not a one-way ascending pathway, but also contains descending feedback projections. Although studies have explored the role of this feedback system, it is unclear whether corticothalamic feedback contributes to adaptation in the LGN. To investigate these questions, we studied contrast adaptation of LGN neurons in anesthetized and paralysed cats by measuring electrophysiological responses to visual test stimuli before and after adaptation induced by prolonged visual stimulation. After adaptation, contrast response functions were usually shifted towards higher contrasts, indicating decreased contrast gain, and the maximum response decreased. Also, contrast adaptation effects were stronger in Y-cells than in X-cells. Furthermore, adaptation effects were still observed in the LGN when the corticothalamic feedback was inactivated. Changes in the contrast gain of Y-cells were diminished in the absence of feedback, while contrast gain was largely unchanged in X-cells. Our observations confirm that contrast adaptation occurs in LGN neurons and furthermore demonstrate that Y-cells show stronger adaptation effects than X-cells. These results also provide an example of how corticothalamic feedback modulates contrast information processing distinctly in different information channels.},

abstract = {To study the cortical mechanism of figure/ground categorization in the human brain, we employed fMRI and the temporal-asynchrony paradigm. This paradigm is able to eliminate any differential activation for local stimulus features, and thus to identify only global perceptual interactions. Strong segmentation of the image into different spatial configurations was generated solely from temporal asynchronies between zones of homogeneous dynamic noise. The figure/ground configuration was a single geometric figure enclosed in a larger surround region. In a control condition, the figure/ground organization was eliminated by segmenting the noise field into many identical temporal-asynchrony stripes. The manipulation of the type of perceptual organization triggered dramatic reorganization in the cortical activation pattern. The figure/ground configuration generated suppression of the ground representation (limited to early retinotopic visual cortex, V1 and V2) and strong activation in the motion complex hMT+/V5+; conversely, both responses were abolished when the figure/ground organization was eliminated. These results suggest that figure/ground processing is mediated by top-down suppression of the ground representation in the earliest visual areas V1/V2 through a signal arising in the motion complex. We propose a model of a recurrent cortical architecture incorporating suppressive feedback that operates in a topographic manner, forming a figure/ground categorization network distinct from that for “pure” scene segmentation and thus underlying the perceptual organization of dynamic scenes into cognitively relevant components.},

In the visual system, it is involved in the processing of the visual information from the retina to superior visual centers. In this review we discuss the main mechanisms through which nitric oxide acts, in physiological levels, on the retina, lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex. In the retina, the cGMP-dependent nitric oxide activity initially amplifies the signal, subsequently increasing the inhibitory activity, suggesting that the signal is “filtered”. In the thalamus, on dLGN, neuronal activity is amplified by NO derived from brainstem cholinergic cells, in a cGMP-independent mechanism; the result is the amplification of the signal arriving from retina. Finally, on the visual cortex (V1), NO acts through changes on the cGMP levels, increasing signal detection. These observations suggest that NO works like a filter, modulating the signal along the visual pathways.},

One example is an object looming in the direction of the observer-presumably because such a stimulus signals an impending collision. A critical question for understanding the relationship between attention and conscious awareness is whether awareness is required for this type of prioritized attentional selection. Although it has been suggested that visual spatial attention can only be affected by consciously perceived events, we show that automatic allocation of attention can occur even without conscious awareness of impending threat. We used a visual search task to show that a looming stimulus on a collision path with an observer captures attention but a looming stimulus on a near-miss path does not. Critically, observers were unaware of any difference between collision and near-miss stimuli even when explicitly asked to discriminate between them in separate experiments. These results counter traditional salience-based models of attentional capture, demonstrating that in the absence of perceptual awareness, the visual system can extract behaviorally relevant details from a visual scene and automatically categorize threatening versus nonthreatening images at a level of precision beyond our conscious perceptual capabilities.},

Participants performed an attentionally demanding target detection task at fixation while also viewing a rapid sequence of full-field photographs of urban and natural scenes. Participants were then tested on whether they recognized a specific scene from the previous sequence. We found that scenes were recognized reliably only when presented concurrently with a target at fixation.

abstract = {One of the reasons the visual cortex has attracted the interest of computational neuroscience is that it has well-defined inputs. The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the thalamus is the source of visual signals to the primary visual cortex (V1). Most large-scale cortical network models approximate the spike trains of LGN neurons as simple Poisson point processes. However, many studies have shown that neurons in the early visual pathway are capable of spiking with high temporal precision and their discharges are not Poisson-like. To gain an understanding of how response variability in the LGN influences the behavior of V1, we study response properties of model V1 neurons that receive purely feedforward inputs from LGN cells modeled either as noisy leaky integrate-and-fire (NLIF) neurons or as inhomogeneous Poisson processes. We first demonstrate that the NLIF model is capable of reproducing many experimentally observed statistical properties of LGN neurons. Then we show that a V1 model in which the LGN input to a V1 neuron is modeled as a group of NLIF neurons produces higher orientation selectivity than the one with Poisson LGN input. The second result implies that statistical characteristics of LGN spike trains are important for V1’s function. We conclude that physiologically motivated models of V1 need to include more realistic LGN spike trains that are less noisy than inhomogeneous Poisson processes.},

This is the color-motion asynchrony illusion. According to the differential processing time model, the illusion is explained because the neural activity leading to the perceptual experience of motion requires more time than that of color. Alternatively, the time marker model attributes the misbinding to a failure in matching different sorts of changes at rapid alternations. Here, running counter to the time marker model, we demonstrate that the illusion can arise with a single direction change. Using this simplified version of the illusion we also show that, although some form of visual masking takes place between colors, the measured asynchrony genuinely reflects processing time differences.},

Recent applications range from the implementation of virtual reality systems for studying motor responses both in mice and in zebrafish, to control of seizures following cortical stroke using optogenetics. A key advantage of closed-loop techniques resides in the capability of probing higher dimensional properties that are not directly accessible or that depend on multiple variables, such as neuronal excitability and reliability, while at the same time maximizing the experimental throughput. In this contribution and in the context of cellular electrophysiology, we describe how to apply a variety of closed-loop protocols to the study of the response properties of pyramidal cortical neurons, recorded intracellularly with the patch clamp technique in acute brain slices from the somatosensory cortex of juvenile rats. As no commercially available or open source software provides all the features required for efficiently performing the experiments described here, a new software toolbox called LCG was developed, whose modular structure maximizes reuse of computer code and facilitates the implementation of novel experimental paradigms. Stimulation waveforms are specified using a compact meta-description and full experimental protocols are described in text-based configuration files. Additionally, LCG has a command-line interface that is suited for repetition of trials and automation of experimental protocols.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Transfer entropy (TE) is a measure for the detection of directed interactions. Transfer entropy is an information theoretic implementation of Wiener’s principle of observational causality. It offers an approach to the detection of neuronal interactions that is free of an explicit model of the interactions. Hence, it offers the power to analyze linear and nonlinear interactions alike. This allows for example the comprehensive analysis of directed interactions in neural networks at various levels of description. Here we present the open-source MATLAB toolbox TRENTOOL that allows the user to handle the considerable complexity of this measure and to validate the obtained results using non-parametrical statistical testing. We demonstrate the use of the toolbox and the performance of the algorithm on simulated data with nonlinear (quadratic) coupling and on local field potentials (LFP) recorded from the retina and the optic tectum of the turtle (Pseudemys scripta elegans) where a neuronal one-way connection is likely present.RESULTS:In simulated data TE detected information flow in the simulated direction reliably with false positives not exceeding the rates expected under the null hypothesis. In the LFP data we found directed interactions from the retina to the tectum, despite the complicated signal transformations between these stages. No false positive interactions in the reverse directions were detected.CONCLUSIONS:TRENTOOL is an implementation of transfer entropy and mutual information analysis that aims to support the user in the application of this information theoretic measure. TRENTOOL is implemented as a MATLAB toolbox and available under an open source license (GPL v3). For the use with neural data TRENTOOL seamlessly integrates with the popular FieldTrip toolbox.},

abstract = {The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) is considered as the visual gateway to the visual cortex (VC) and sends collaterals to the thalamic reticular nucleus (RTN) that in turn receives collaterals of the corticofugal feedback projections. At all levels of this thalamocortical circuit there are GABAergic neurons expressing the calcium-buffer parvalbumin (PV). The present study reports for the first time the analysis of in vivo extracellular electrophysiological recordings performed simultaneously in dLGN, RTN and VC of anesthetized wild-type (WT) and parvalbumin-deficient (PVKO) mice. The firing rates of VC and RTN cells were increased in PVKO during spontaneous activity as well as in the presence of a photic stimulation (strobe flash at 2.5Hz). Interestingly, dLGN cells in PVKO did not show significant changes in the rate of firing in comparison to WT. dLGN responses to the light flashes were characterized by ripples of inhibition and phasic excitation/rebound. We have analyzed the pattern of functional interactions between pairs of neighboring cells in VC, dLGN and RTN and across these areas in simultaneously recorded thalamocortical triplets, with one neuron from each area. We found that in PVKO the strength of the interactions tended to decrease locally, between neighboring cells, but tended to increase across the areas. The combination of these analyses provides new evidence on the important role played by PV-expression in regulating information processing in the central visual pathway suggesting that the ability to process information along parallel channels is decreased in the thalamocortical pathway of PV-deficient mice.

Each of these processes entails several levels of analysis: the behavioral properties, the underlying computational algorithm, and the cellular/network mechanisms that implement that algorithm. At this juncture, while many questions remain unanswered, achievements in several areas of research have made it possible to relate specific properties of brain networks to cognitive functions. What has been learned reveals, at least in rough outline, how cognitive processes can be an emergent property of neurons and their connections.},

Synaptic connections were made only from one layer to the next, and excitation was balanced by inhibition. When time is discrete and the synaptic potentials rise instantaneously, we show that, for random uncorrelated input to layer one, the mean rate of activity in deep layers is essentially independent of input firing rate. This implies that the input rate cannot be transmitted reliably in such feedforward networks because neurons in a given layer tend to synchronize partially with each other because of shared inputs. As a result of this synchronization, the average firing rate in deep layers will either decay to zero or reach a stable fixed point, depending on model parameters. When time is treated continuously and the synaptic potentials rise instantaneously, these effects develop slowly, and rate transmission over a limited number of layers is possible. However, the correlations among neurons at the same layer hamper reliable assessment of firing rate by averaging over 100 msec (or less). When the synaptic potentials develop gradually, as is the realistic case, transmission of rate code fails. In a network in which inhibition only balances the mean excitation but is not timed precisely with it, neurons in each layer fire together, and this volley successively propagates from layer to layer. We conclude that the transmission of rate code in feedforward networks is highly unlikely.},

Three types of synapses, made by morphologically distinguishable small terminals (ST), large terminals (LT), and GABAergic terminals, were distributed on all portions of the dendritic trees of injected RTN cells. ST and LT terminals formed asymmetrical, presumed excitatory, synaptic contacts. On proximal dendrites, approximately 50% of the synapses were ST, 30-40% were LT, and 10-25% were GABAergic. On distal dendrites, 60-65% were ST, 20% were LT, and 15% were GABAergic. PHA-L labeling showed that labeled corticothalamic terminals and ST terminals have identical morphological features and the same distribution patterns on RTN dendrites, indicating that the majority of excitatory afferents to RTN neurons are derived from the cerebral cortex. The LT terminals found in smaller numbers are probably derived from collateral axons of thalamocortical relay cells. GABAergic terminals formed by LY-labeled, intra-RTN axon collaterals were relatively few in number, and no dendrodendritic synapses were observed.},

Although the locus of spatial attention has been hypothesized to be represented by priority maps encoded in several dorsal frontal and parietal areas, it is unknown how the brain represents attended features. Here we examined the distribution and organization of neural signals related to deployment of feature-based attention. Subjects viewed a compound stimulus containing two superimposed motion directions (or colors) and were instructed to perform an attention-demanding task on one of the directions (or colors). We found elevated and sustained functional magnetic resonance imaging response for the attention task compared with a neutral condition, without reliable differences in overall response amplitude between attending to different features. However, using multivoxel pattern analysis, we were able to decode the attended feature in both early visual areas (primary visual cortex to human motion complex hMT+) and frontal and parietal areas (e.g., intraparietal sulcus areas IPS1‚ÄìIPS4 and frontal eye fields) that are commonly associated with spatial attention. Furthermore, analysis of the classifier weight maps showed that attending to motion and color evoked different patterns of activity, suggesting that different neuronal subpopulations in these regions are recruited for attending to different feature dimensions. Thus, our finding suggests that, rather than a purely spatial representation of priority, frontal and parietal cortical areas also contain multiplexed signals related to the priority of different nonspatial features.},

Behavioral performance was impaired during the learning phase but not after the mice were well trained. Delay-period mPFC activity appeared to be more important in memory retention than in inhibitory control, decision-making, or motor selection.

abstract = {The process of orientation tuning is an important and well-characterized feature of neurons in primary visual cortex.
The combination of ascending and descending circuits involved is not only relevant to understanding visual processing but the function of neocortex in general.
The classic feed-forward model of orientation tuning predicts a broadening effect due to increasing contrast; yet, experimental results consistently report contrast invariance.
We show here that contrast invariance actually depends on stimulus size such that large stimuli extending beyond the neuron’s receptive field engage circuits that promote invariance, whereas optimally sized, smaller stimuli result in contrast variance that is more in line with the classical orientation tuning model.
These results illustrate the importance of optimizing stimulus parameters to best reflect the sensory pathways under study and provide new clues about different circuits that may be involved in variant and invariant response properties.

Selective response to stimulus orientation is a key feature of neurons in primary visual cortex, yet the underlying mechanisms generating orientation tuning are not fully understood. The combination of feed-forward and cortical mechanisms involved is not only relevant to understanding visual processing but the function of neocortex in general. The classic feed-forward model predicts that orientation tuning should broaden considerably with increasing contrast; however, experimental results consistently report contrast invariance. We show here, in primary visual cortex of anaesthetized cats under neuromuscular blockade, that contrast invariance occurs when visual stimuli are large enough to include the extraclassical surround (ECS), which is likely to involve circuits of suppression that may not be entirely feed-forward in origin. On the other hand, when stimulus size is optimized to the classical receptive field of each neuron, the population average shows a statistically significant 40% increase in tuning width at high contrast, demonstrating that contrast variance of orientation tuning can occur. Conversely, our results also suggest that the phenomenon of contrast invariance relies in part on the presence of the ECS. Moreover, these results illustrate the importance of optimizing stimulus parameters to best reflect the neural pathways under study.},

This issue was investigated in single cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus of barbiturate-anesthetized cats by quantifying the degree of precision in and the information transmission properties of individual spike train responses to full field, binary (bright or dark), flashing stimuli. We found that neuronal responses could be highly reproducible in their spike timing (approximately 1-2 ms standard deviation) and spike count (approximately 0.3 ratio of variance/mean, compared with 1.0 expected for a Poisson process). This degree of precision only became apparent when an adequate length of the stimulus sequence was specified to determine the neural response, emphasizing that the variables relevant to a cell’s response must be controlled to observe the cell’s intrinsic response precision. Responses could carry as much as 3.5 bits/spike of information about the stimulus, a rate that was within a factor of two of the limit the spike train could transmit. Moreover, there appeared to be little sign of redundancy in coding: on average, longer response sequences carried at least as much information about the stimulus as would be obtained by adding together the information carried by shorter response sequences considered independently. There also was no direct evidence found for synergy between response sequences. These results could largely, but not entirely, be explained by a simple model of the response in which one filters the stimulus by the cell’s impulse response kernel, thresholds the result at a fairly high level, and incorporates a postspike refractory period.},

We found that V2 RFs could be broadly classified as V1-like (typical Gabor-shaped subunits), ultralong (subunits with high aspect ratios), or complex-shaped (subunits with multiple oriented components). Furthermore, single-unit recordings from functional domains identified by intrinsic optical imaging showed that neurons with ultralong RFs were primarily localized within pale stripes, whereas neurons with complex-shaped RFs were more concentrated in thin stripes. Thus, by combining single-unit recording with optical imaging and a computational approach, we identified RF subunits underlying spatial feature selectivity of V2 neurons and demonstrated the functional organization of these RF properties.},

We found that dorsal LIP (LIPd) is primarily involved in oculomotor planning, whereas ventral LIP (LIPv) contributes to both attentional and oculomotor processes. Additional testing revealed that the two functions were dissociable, even in LIPv.

To address their respective functional roles, we developed a new method for silencing cortex by competitively activating GABAA while blocking GABAB receptors. In the rat primary auditory cortex, in vivo whole-cell recording from the same neuron before and after local cortical silencing revealed that thalamic input occupied the same area of frequency-intensity tonal receptive field as the total excitatory input, but showed a flattened tuning curve. In contrast, excitatory intracortical input was sharply tuned with a tuning curve that closely matched that of suprathreshold responses. This can be attributed to a selective amplification of cortical cells’ responses at preferred frequencies by intracortical inputs from similarly tuned neurons. Thus, weakly tuned thalamocortical inputs determine the subthreshold responding range, whereas intracortical inputs largely define the tuning. Such circuits may ensure a faithful conveyance of sensory information.},

We used two-dimensional (2-D) sparse noise to map simultaneous and sequential two-spot interactions in simple and complex direction-selective cells in macaque V1. Sequential-interaction maps for both simple and complex cells showed preferred-direction facilitation and null-direction suppression for same-contrast stimulus sequences and the reverse for inverting-contrast sequences, although the magnitudes of the interactions were weaker for the simple cells. Contrast-sign selectivity in complex cells indicates that direction-selective interactions in these cells must occur in antecedent simple cells or in simple-cell-like dendritic compartments. Our maps suggest that direction selectivity, and ON and OFF segregation perpendicular to the orientation axis, can occur prior to receptive-field elongation along the orientation axis. 2-D interaction maps for some complex cells showed elongated alternating facilitatory and suppressive interactions as predicted if their inputs were orientation-selective simple cells. The negative interactions, however, were less elongated than the positive interactions, and there was an inflection at the origin in the positive interactions, so the interactions were chevron-shaped rather than band-like. Other complex cells showed only two round interaction regions, one negative and one positive. Several explanations for the map shapes are considered, including the possibility that directional interactions are generated directly from unoriented inputs},

Not only did the space-timps of directional simple cells show different slants between high and low contrast stimuli, but they also showed a different organization, because for high-contrast stimuli the maps tended to show a complete inversion of the receptive-field spatial organization at long delays after stimulus onset, with initial excitation followed by suppression and initial suppression followed by excitation, but for low-contrast stimuli the receptive-field organization showed only a quadrature shift over time.

In an attempt to learn more about the input to these blobs, we injected the lateral geniculate bodies of macaques and squirrel monkeys with [3H]proline or horseradish peroxidase and looked in the cortex for transported label. As expected, label was present in layers IVa, IVc alpha, IVc beta, and VI. In addition, both methods revealed an array of puffs deep in layer III. Seen in tangential sections, the puffs precisely matched the cytochrome blobs. These results indicate a projection from the lateral geniculate body to the blob regions deep in layer II/III, either indirect via layer IV or more likely direct. In area 18 stained for cytochrome oxidase, we also observed complex banding patterns; these were remarkably similar to the pattern found after [3H]proline or horseradish peroxidase injection and were also similar to the pattern produced with 2-deoxyglucose labeling after stimulation with vertical or horizontal stripes; the proline and peroxidase labels probably represent a projection from the pulvinar to area 18.},

The similarity in electrophysiological properties unambiguously indicates that the thalamocortical system must be as ancient as the vertebrate brach itself. We address the view that rather than simply relays, thalamic neurons have sui generis intrinsic electrical properties that govern their specific functional dynamics and regulate natural functional states such as sleep and vigilance. In addition, thalamocortical activity has been shown to be involved in the genesis of several neuropsychiatric conditions collectively described as thalamocortical dysrhythmia syndrome.},

abstract = {It is generally supposed that there is a single, hierarchically organized pathway dedicated to form processing, in which complex forms are elaborated from simpler ones, beginning with the orientation-selective cells of V1. In this psychophysical study, we undertook to test another hypothesis, namely that the brain’s visual form system consists of multiple parallel systems and that complex forms are other than the sum of their parts. Inspired by imaging experiments which show that forms of increasing perceptual complexity (lines, angles, and rhombuses) constituted from the same elements (lines) activate the same visual areas (V1, V2, and V3) with the same intensity and latency (Shigihara and Zeki, 2013, 2014), we used backward masking to test the supposition that these forms are processed in parallel. We presented subjects with lines, angles, and rhombuses as different target-mask pairs. Evidence in favor of our supposition would be if masking is the most effective when target and mask are processed by the same system and least effective when they are processed in different systems. Our results showed that rhombuses were strongly masked by rhombuses but only weakly masked by lines or angles, but angles and lines were well masked by each other. The relative resistance of rhombuses to masking by low-level forms like lines and angles suggests that complex forms like rhombuses may be processed in a separate parallel system, whereas lines and angles are processed in the same one.},

Previous work showed that networks of electrically coupled inhibitory interneurons called low-threshold spiking (LTS) cells can fire synchronously when stimulated by metabotropic glutamate receptors. Here we found that the coordinated inhibition emerging from an activated LTS network could induce correlated spiking patterns among neighboring excitatory cells. Synchronous activity among LTS cells was absent at postnatal day 12 (P12) but appeared abruptly over the next few days. The rapid development of the LTS-synchronizing system coincided with the maturation of the inhibitory outputs and intrinsic membrane properties of the neurons. In contrast, the incidence and magnitude of electrical synapses remained constant between P8 and P15. The developmental transformation of LTS interneurons into a synchronous, oscillatory network overlaps with the onset of active somatosensory exploration, suggesting a potential role for this synchronizing system in sensory processing.},

doi = {10.1073/pnas.0607364103 - People with sensorineural hearing loss have difficulty understanding speech, especially when background sounds are present. A reduction in the ability to resolve the frequency components of complex sounds is one factor contributing to this difficulty. Here, we show that a reduced ability to process the temporal fine structure of sounds plays an important role. Speech sounds were processed by filtering them into 16 adjacent frequency bands. The signal in each band was processed by using the Hilbert transform so as to preserve either the envelope (E, the relatively slow variations in amplitude over time) or the temporal fine structure (TFS, the rapid oscillations with rate close to the center frequency of the band). The band signals were then recombined and the stimuli were presented to subjects for identification. After training, normal-hearing subjects scored perfectly with unprocessed speech, and were approximately 90% correct with E and TFS speech. Both young and elderly subjects with moderate flat hearing loss performed almost as well as normal with unprocessed and E speech but performed very poorly with TFS speech, indicating a greatly reduced ability to use TFS. For the younger hearing-impaired group, TFS scores were highly correlated with the ability to take advantage of temporal dips in a background noise when identifying unprocessed speech. The results suggest that the ability to use TFS may be critical for “listening in the background dips.” TFS stimuli may be useful in evaluating impaired hearing and in guiding the design of hearing aids and cochlear implants.10.1073/pnas.0607364103},

We therefore trained monkeys to navigate through a decision tree with stochastic sensory evidence at multiple branching points and recorded neuronal activity in visual cortical areas V1 and V4. We found a first phase of decision making in which neuronal activity increased in parallel along multiple branches of the decision tree. This was followed by an integration phase where the optimal overall strategy crystallized as the result of interactions between local decisions. The results reveal how sensory evidence is integrated efficiently for hierarchical decisions and contribute to our understanding of the brain mechanisms that implement complex mental programs.},

abstract = {Areas V1 and V2 of Macaque monkey visual cortex are characterized by unique cytochrome-oxidase (CO)-staining patterns. Initial electrophysiological studies associated CO blobs in V1 with processing of surface properties such as color and brightness and the interblobs with contour information processing. However, many subsequent studies showed controversial results, some supporting this proposal and others failing to find significant functional differences between blobs and interblobs. In this study, we have used optical imaging to map color-selective responses in V1 and V2. In V1, we find striking “blob-like” patterns of color response. Fine alignment of optical maps and CO-stained tissue revealed that color domains in V1 strongly associate with CO blobs. We also find color domains in V1 align along centers of ocular dominance columns. Furthermore, color blobs in V1 have low orientation selectivity and do not overlap with centers of orientation domains. In V2, color domains coincide with thin stripes; orientation-selective domains coincide with thick and pale stripes. We conclude that color and orientation-selective responses are preferentially located in distinct CO compartments in V1 and V2. We propose that the term “blob” encompasses both the concept of “CO blob” and “color domain” in V1.},

Although REM sleep was discovered more than 50 years ago, the neuronal circuits responsible for switching between REM and non-REM (NREM) sleep remain poorly understood. Here we propose a brainstem flip–flop switch, consisting of mutually inhibitory REM-off and REM-on areas in the mesopontine tegmentum. Each side contains GABA (-aminobutyric acid)-ergic neurons that heavily innervate the other. The REM-on area also contains two populations of glutamatergic neurons. One set projects to the basal forebrain and regulates EEG components of REM sleep, whereas the other projects to the medulla and spinal cord and regulates atonia during REM sleep. The mutually inhibitory interactions of the REM-on and REM-off areas may form a flip–flop switch that sharpens state transitions and makes them vulnerable to sudden, unwanted transitions—for example, in narcolepsy.},

pages = {2185–2198}, 
year = {1992}, 
abstract = {1. Thalamic relay cells, including those of the lateral geniculate nucleus, display a low-threshold spike (LT spike), which is a large depolarization due to an increased Ca2+ conductance. Typically riding the crest of each LT spike is a burst of from two to seven action potentials, which we refer to as the LT burst. The LT spike is voltage dependent, because if the cell’s resting membrane potential is more depolarized than roughly -60 mV, the LT spike is inactivated, but if more hyperpolarized, the spike is deinactivated and can be activated by a depolarization, such as from an afferent excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP). Thalamic relay cells thus display two response modes: a relay or tonic mode, when the cell is depolarized and LT spikes are inactivated, leading to tonic firing of action potentials; and a burst mode, when the cell is hyperpolarized and tends to respond with LT spikes and their associated bursts of action potentials. 2. We were interested in the contribution of the LT spike on the transmission of visually evoked signals through geniculate relay cells to visual cortex. We recorded intracellularly from geniculate cells in an anesthetized, paralyzed, in vivo cat preparation to study the effects of membrane voltage, and thus the presence or absence of LT spikes, on responses to drifting sine-wave gratings. We monitored the visually evoked responses of 14 geniculate neurons (6 X, 7 Y, and 1 unclassified) at different membrane potentials at which LT spikes were inactivated or deinactivated. 3. Changing membrane voltage during visual stimulation switched the response mode of every cell between the relay and burst modes. In the burst mode, LT spikes occurred in phase with the visual stimulus and not at rhythmic intervals uncorrelated to visual stimuli. To any given stimulus cycle, the cell responded usually with an LT burst or a tonic response, and rarely was more than one LT burst evoked by a stimulus cycle. Occasionally a single cycle evoked both an LT burst and tonic response, but always the LT burst occurred first. 4. The spatial tuning characteristics of the cells did not differ dramatically as a function of membrane potential, because the tuning of the LT bursts was quite similar to that of the tonic response component. Although we did not obtain complete temporal tuning properties, we did note that hyperpolarized cells responded reliably with LT bursts at several temporal frequencies. 5. A consistent difference was seen between the LT burst and tonic response components in terms of response linearity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {One paradox in primate vision concerns the increasing complexity of encoded features while spatial frequency (SF) selectivity decreases drastically along the visual hierarchy. We know V1 holds the highest SF selectivity for fine spatial analysis, however the comparative SF processing in different functional stripes of V2 as well as in the downstream V4 is less clear. By simultaneous intrinsic optical imaging of macaque V1, V2 and V4, we quantitatively measured the population responses across these visual areas to sine-wave gratings with various SFs. As expected we found that the SF selectivity was the highest in V1 while most regions in V4 exhibited the lowest SF selectivity. The population responses of V1, V2, and V4 were subsequently confirmed by single-unit recordings in awake macaques. Compared with V1 and V4, V2 exhibited the strongest population response magnitude. We further investigated the SF selectivity across V2 functional stripes and found that the SF selectivity in thick stripes were lower than that in both thin and pale stripes. No significant SF difference was found between the thin and pale stripes. Our findings on the distinct SF selectivity across simultaneously imaged V1, V2, and V4 sheds lights on the spatial analysis along the visual hierarchy, which help to further our understanding and electrophysiological studies as well as computational modelling of the integration of local spatial features to form global representations.},

Electrophysiological single-unit recordings have revealed an inverse proportionality between the receptive field size, spatial frequency (SF) selectivity of V1 neurons and their eccentricities. As eccentricity is measured as the distance (degrees) from the fovea whereas cortical magnification factor (CMF) is calculated as cortical surface distance/visual angle (mm/degree), the correlation between the neural SF selectivity and CMF in macaque V1 has not yet been quantitatively defined. In this study by using intrinsic optical imaging, we quantitatively measured the direct proportionality between SF selectivity and CMF in macaque V1. We first mapped and analyzed the fine cortical representation of the visual space by fast Fourier intrinsic optical imaging before the acquisition of the eccentricity and CMF maps with high spatial resolution. The SF selectivity of each pixel of the imaged area was measured in response to sine-wave gratings with various combinations of orientation and SF. A physiometric function for SF selectivity and CMF was thus determined in the imaged areas of macaque V1. We also quantitatively measured the inverse proportionality between eccentricity and CMF and between the size of orientation domains and CMF. These quantitative measurements of relationship among SF selectivity, eccentricity, orientation domains and CMF will be highly informative for future electrophysiological recording, other brain imaging studies and computational modeling in primates.},

abstract = {Models of perceptual decision making often assume that sensory evidence is accumulated over time in favor of the various possible decisions, until the evidence in favor of one of them outweighs the evidence for the others. Saccadic eye movements are among the most frequent perceptual decisions that the human brain performs. We used stochastic visual stimuli to identify the temporal impulse response underlying saccadic eye movement decisions. Observers performed a contrast search task, with temporal variability in the visual signals. In experiment 1, we derived the temporal filter observers used to integrate the visual information. The integration window was restricted to the first approximately 100 ms after display onset. In experiment 2, we showed that observers cannot perform the task if there is no useful information to distinguish the target from the distractor within this time epoch. We conclude that (1) observers did not integrate sensory evidence up to a criterion level, (2) observers did not integrate visual information up to the start of the saccadic dead time, and (3) variability in saccade latency does not correspond to variability in the visual integration period. Instead, our results support a temporal filter model of saccadic decision making. The temporal impulse response identified by our methods corresponds well with estimates of integration times of V1 output neurons.},

However, the brain mechanisms that support our ability to translate knowledge about scene statistics to sensory predictions remain largely unknown. Here we provide evidence that learning of temporal regularities shapes representations in early visual cortex that relate to our ability to predict sensory events. We tested the participants’ ability to predict the orientation of a test stimulus after exposure to sequences of leftward- or rightward-oriented gratings. Using fMRI decoding, we identified brain patterns related to the observers’ visual predictions rather than stimulus-driven activity. Decoding of predicted orientations following structured sequences was enhanced after training, while decoding of cued orientations following exposure to random sequences did not change. These predictive representations appear to be driven by the same large-scale neural populations that encode actual stimulus orientation and to be specific to the learned sequence structure. Thus our findings provide evidence that learning temporal structures supports our ability to predict future events by reactivating selective sensory representations as early as in primary visual cortex.},

abstract = {We investigated the responses of single neurons in the middle temporal area (MT) of anesthetized marmoset monkeys to sine-wave gratings of various lengths and widths. For the vast majority of MT cells maximal responses were obtained on presentation of gratings of specific dimensions, which were typically asymmetrical along the length and width axes. The strength of end inhibition was dependent on the width of the stimulus, with many cells showing clear end inhibition only when wide gratings were used. Conversely, the strength of side inhibition was dependent on stimulus length. Furthermore, for over one third of MT cells length summation properties could not be defined without consideration of stimulus width and vice versa. These neurons, which we refer to as “length-width inseparable” (LWI) cells, were rare in layer 4. The majority of LWI neurons was strongly inhibited by wide-field stimuli and responded preferentially to gratings that were elongated, along either the length or width dimensions. However, rather than forming a homogeneous and entirely distinct group, LWI cells represented the upper end of a continuum of complexity in spatial summation response properties, which characterized the population of MT cells. Only a minority of MT neurons (22.3%) showed no evidence of inhibition by wide-field stimuli, with this type of response being common among layer 5 cells. These results demonstrate distinct patterns of spatial selectivity in MT, supporting the notion that neurons in this area can perform various roles in terms of grouping and segmentation of motion signals.},

abstract = {In normal vision, the inputs from the two eyes are integrated into a single percept. When dissimilar images are presented to the two eyes, however, they compete for perceptual dominance, so that one eye’s view suppresses that of the other. Recent evidence suggests that this phenomenon, known as binocular rivalry, arises through competition between alternative stimulus interpretations in extrastriate cortex. Because eye-specific information appears to be lost at this stage, it remains unclear how the stimulus conditions that yield binocular rivalry are distinguished from those that produce stable single vision. Using a neural network that models the mammalian early visual system, I investigate here the hypothesis that congruent and conflicting stimuli are distinguished by their different effects on the relative timing of action potentials in primary visual cortex (V1), where monocular inputs are first combined. In the model, congruent stimulation of both eyes results in synchronization of discharges among binocular neurons in V1. By contrast, conflicting stimulation of the two eyes results in neuronal asynchrony in this area. This asynchrony then produces rivalrous response suppression at later stages in the visual pathway. Synchronization of firing in V1, however, prevents such competition, thereby ensuring non-rivalrous responses. These novel effects of spike timing on competition emerge naturally from the network dynamics. The results suggest that input-related differences in relative spike timing at an early stage of visual processing may play an important part in the phenomena both of binocular integration and rivalry; furthermore, they indicate that the temporal patterning of cortical activity may be a fundamental mechanism of selection among competing stimulus representations.},

The model consisted of 65,000 spiking neurons organized topographically to represent sectors of a primary and secondary area of mammalian visual cortex, and two associated regions of the dorsal thalamus and the thalamic reticular nucleus. Cortical neurons, both excitatory and inhibitory, were organized in supragranular layers, infraganular layers and layer IV. Reciprocal intra- and interlaminar, interareal, thalamocortical, corticothalamic and thalamoreticular connections were set up based on known anatomical constraints. Simulations of neuronal responses to visual input revealed sporadic epochs of synchronous oscillations involving all levels of the model, similar to the fast rhythms recorded in vivo. By systematically modifying physiological and structural parameters in the model, specific network properties were found to play a major role in the generation of this rhythmic activity. For example, fast synchronous rhythms could be sustained autonomously by lateral and interlaminar interactions within and among local cortical circuits. In addition, these oscillations were propagated to the thalamus and amplified by corticothalamocortical loops, including the thalamic reticular complex. Finally, synchronous oscillations were differentially affected by lesioning forward and backward interareal connections.},

abstract = {Activity in the mammalian thalamocortical system is often accompanied by a synchronous discharge of cortical and thalamic neurons. Although many functions have been attributed to such synchronous firing, it is not known whether or how synchrony of firing per se affects thalamocortical operations. Direct experimental tests of the consequences of neuronal synchronization in vivo are hard to carry out, whereas theoretical studies based on single-neuron models cannot reveal the effects of synchrony at the system level. To overcome these limitations, we have used a perturbational approach to test the causal efficacy of synchrony per se in large-scale simulations of the thalamocortical system. The test consists of selectively disrupting firing synchrony by ‘jittering’ the timing of action potentials in the simulations and determining whether firing rates are modified by this perturbation. The simulations are based in detail on the known anatomy and physiology of the thalamocortical-visual system of the cat, and have been shown in a companion paper to produce episodes of fast synchronous activity at multiple levels. By carrying out the perturbation analysis, we established that neurons can have long membrane time constants (8-16 ms) and balanced synaptic activations, and yet function collectively in such a way that synchrony within a time window of 4 ms significantly affects the rates and selectivity of the responses to visual stimuli. The simulations also revealed a complex interplay, at the network level, between synchrony of firing and rate of firing. The dynamic consequences of firing synchrony were most evident when spike jittering was applied to specific polysynaptic loops involving corticocortical and corticothalamic connections. These results support the view that firing synchrony within thalamocortical and corticocortical loops plays a causal role in the cooperative and competitive neural interactions that produce pattern-selective responses in the cortex.

Each lamina is driven by different patterns of relays from the LGN and by different patterns of intrinsic interlaminar projections. The elaborate laminar and intralaminar segregation of efferent neuron arrays suggests that the extraordinary precision of inter- and intralaminar connectivity provides a unique functional role for each set of efferent neurons. The organization of aspinous (presumed inhibitory) local circuit neurons suggests that they are highly specialized, and within each lamina and via interlaminar relays each variety may only accomplish a single, particular task. The cortex neuropil does not give the immediate impression of “random” networks, and if such exist, they must surely be between very tightly determined subgroups of neurons. Clearly a very detailed physiological exploration of V1 is still needed, with new consideration of thalamic axon function, of efferent neuron characteristics, of laminar differences, and of spatial organization of properties within laminae, in order to match known anatomical detail with function. The concept of columnar organization in cortical organization of V1 may eventually be redefined in more complex terms that accurately describe the anatomical and functional parcellation evident in cortical depth and perhaps may link it to a means by which a correlation of different aspects of the visual image is achieved.},

abstract = {The retrograde transport of horseradish peroxidase has been used to identify efferent cells in area 17 of the macaque. Cells projecting to the lateral geniculate nucleus are small to medium sized pyramidal neurons with somata in lamina 6 and the adjacent white matter. The projection to the parvocellular division arises preferentially from the upper half of lamina 6, while that to the magnocellular division arises preferentially from the lower part of the lamina. The projection to both superior colliculus and inferior pulvinar arises from all sizes of pyramidal neurons lying in lamina 58 (Lund and Boothe, ‘75); at least pyramidal neurons of lamina 5B send collateral axon branches to both destinations. Injections with extensive spread of horseradish peroxidase show that many cells of lamina 4B and the large pyramidal neurons of upper lamina 6 also project extrinsically but their terminal sites have not been identified. Other studies have indicated that cells of laminae 2 and 3 project to areas 18 and 19. Therefore every lamina of the visual cortex, with the exception of those receiving a direct thalamic input, contains cells projecting extrinsically. Further, each lamina projects to a different destination and from Golgi studies can be shown to contain cells with specific patterns of dendritic branching which relate to the distribution of thalamic afferents and to the patterns of intracortical connections. These findings emphasise the significance of the horizontal organisation of the cortex with relation to the flow of information through it and contrast with the current concept of columnar organisation shown in physiological studies Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

To bridge the gap between conventional and free viewing experiments, we compared responses of neurons across four paradigms ranging from less to more natural. An optimal bar stimulus was either flashed into a receptive field (RF) or brought into it via saccade and was embedded in either a natural scene or a uniform gray background. Responses to a flashed bar tended to be higher with a uniform rather than natural background. The most novel result reported here is that responses evoked by stimuli brought into the RF via saccades were enhanced compared with the same stimuli flashed during steady fixation. No single factor appears to account entirely for this surprising effect, but there were small contributions from fixational saccades and residual activity carried over from the previous fixation. We also found a negative correlation with cells’ response “history” in that a larger response on one fixation was associated with a lower response on the subsequent fixation. The effects of the natural background and saccades exhibited a significant nonlinear interaction with the suppressive effects of the natural background less for stimuli entering RFs with saccades. Together, these results suggest that even responses to standard optimal stimuli are difficult to predict under conditions similar to natural vision, and further demonstrate the importance of naturalistic experimental paradigms to the study of visual processing in V1.},

abstract = {Photoreceptor loss causes irreversible blindness in many retinal diseases. Repair of such damage by cell transplantation is one of the most feasible types of central nervous system repair; photoreceptor degeneration initially leaves the inner retinal circuitry intact and new photoreceptors need only make single, short synaptic connections to contribute to the retinotopic map. So far, brain- and retina-derived stem cells transplanted into adult retina have shown little evidence of being able to integrate into the outer nuclear layer and differentiate into new photoreceptors. Furthermore, there has been no demonstration that transplanted cells form functional synaptic connections with other neurons in the recipient retina or restore visual function. This might be because the mature mammalian retina lacks the ability to accept and incorporate stem cells or to promote photoreceptor differentiation. We hypothesized that committed progenitor or precursor cells at later ontogenetic stages might have a higher probability of success upon transplantation. Here we show that donor cells can integrate into the adult or degenerating retina if they are taken from the developing retina at a time coincident with the peak of rod genesis. These transplanted cells integrate, differentiate into rod photoreceptors, form synaptic connections and improve visual function. Furthermore, we use genetically tagged post-mitotic rod precursors expressing the transcription factor Nrl (ref. 6) (neural retina leucine zipper) to show that successfully integrated rod photoreceptors are derived only from immature post-mitotic rod precursors and not from proliferating progenitor or stem cells. These findings define the ontogenetic stage of donor cells for successful rod photoreceptor transplantation.},

To address this, we used calcium imaging of mouse thalamocortical slices to reconstruct, with single-cell resolution, the spatiotemporal dynamics of activity of layer 4 in the presence or absence of thalamic stimulation. We found spontaneous neuronal coactivations corresponded to intracellular UP states. Thalamic stimulation of sufficient frequency (>10 Hz) triggered cortical activity, and UP states, indistinguishable from those arising spontaneously. Moreover, neurons were activated in identical and precise spatiotemporal patterns in thalamically triggered and spontaneous events. The similarities between cortical activations indicate that intracortical connectivity plays the dominant role in the cortical response to thalamic inputs. Our data demonstrate that precise spatiotemporal activity patterns can be triggered by thalamic inputs and indicate that the thalamus serves to release intrinsic cortical dynamics.},

Here we utilize several intersectional strategies to generate multiple transgenic mouse lines expressing high levels of novel genetic tools with high specificity. We developed driver and double reporter mouse lines and viral vectors using the Cre/Flp and Cre/Dre double recombinase systems and established a new, retargetable genomic locus, TIGRE, which allowed the generation of a large set of Cre/tTA-dependent reporter lines expressing fluorescent proteins, genetically encoded calcium, voltage, or glutamate indicators, and optogenetic effectors, all at substantially higher levels than before. High functionality was shown in example mouse lines for GCaMP6, YCX2.60, VSFP Butterfly 1.2, and Jaws. These novel transgenic lines greatly expand the ability to monitor and manipulate neuronal activities with increased specificity. VIDEO ABSTRACT},

journal = {BMC Neuroscience}, 
volume = {10},

year = {2009}, 
abstract = {BACKGROUND:Information theory is an increasingly popular framework for studying how the brain encodes sensory information. Despite its widespread use for the analysis of spike trains of single neurons and of small neural populations, its application to the analysis of other types of neurophysiological signals (EEGs, LFPs, BOLD) has remained relatively limited so far. This is due to the limited-sampling bias which affects calculation of information, to the complexity of the techniques to eliminate the bias, and to the lack of publicly available fast routines for the information analysis of multi-dimensional responses.RESULTS:Here we introduce a new C- and Matlab-based information theoretic toolbox, specifically developed for neuroscience data. This toolbox implements a novel computationally-optimized algorithm for estimating many of the main information theoretic quantities and bias correction techniques used in neuroscience applications. We illustrate and test the toolbox in several ways. First, we verify that these algorithms provide accurate and unbiased estimates of the information carried by analog brain signals (i.e. LFPs, EEGs, or BOLD) even when using limited amounts of experimental data. This test is important since existing algorithms were so far tested primarily on spike trains. Second, we apply the toolbox to the analysis of EEGs recorded from a subject watching natural movies, and we characterize the electrodes locations, frequencies and signal features carrying the most visual information. Third, we explain how the toolbox can be used to break down the information carried by different features of the neural signal into distinct components reflecting different ways in which correlations between parts of the neural signal contribute to coding. We illustrate this breakdown by analyzing LFPs recorded from primary visual cortex during presentation of naturalistic movies.CONCLUSION:The new toolbox presented here implements fast and data-robust computations of the most relevant quantities used in information theoretic analysis of neural data. The toolbox can be easily used within Matlab, the environment used by most neuroscience laboratories for the acquisition, preprocessing and plotting of neural data. It can therefore significantly enlarge the domain of application of information theory to neuroscience, and lead to new discoveries about the neural code.},

Experiments in monkeys have suggested that, although the proportion of neurons showing this effect differs greatly between cortical areas, this proportion remains similar across different stimuli. These findings have raised the intriguing questions of whether the same neurons always participate in the disambiguation of sensory patterns and whether such neurons might represent a special class of cortical cells that relay perceptual signals to higher cortical areas. Here we explore this question by measuring activity in the middle temporal cortex of monkeys and asking to what degree the percept-related responses of individual neurons depend upon the specific sensory input. In contrast to our expectations, we found that even small differences in the stimuli led to significant changes in the signaling of the perceptual state by single neurons. We conclude that nearly all feature-responsive neurons in this area, rather than a select subset, can contribute to the resolution of sensory conflict, and that the role of individual cells in signaling the perceptual outcome is tightly linked to the fine details of the stimuli involved.},

abstract = {Recent psychological studies suggest that the amygdala is not essential for early stages of emotional facial processing, and that the colliculo-pulvinar pathway might play this role. Nevertheless, the actual role of pulvinar nucleus on the recognition of emotional faces remains obscure. In the present study, we recorded single-unit activity of pulvinar neurons in 2 monkeys during recognition of emotional faces in a delayed non-match-to-sample (DNMS) task, using human face stimuli with differing emotional expressions (sad, angry, happy, surprised and neutral) and simple geometric pattern control figures. A total of 184 single neurons from lateral and medial pulvinar have been sampled. From this total, 41 (22.2%) were found to be “visually responsive”, that is, responded to one or more of the visual stimuli. Among the visually responsive neurons, 23 responded non-differentially to all stimuli (facial stimuli and control). Another 18 responded differentially to facial identity and/or emotional expression. Response latencies of the pulvinar neurons to these facial stimuli ranged very widely; firing onsets for 16 (39.0%, 16/41) neurons were shorter than 100ms, while for 13 (31.7%, 13/41) it was greater than 300ms. The results thus indicate that 43.9% of the visually responsive pulvinar neurons differentially responded to the emotional expressions of the human faces. Furthermore, wide distribution of the response latencies of the pulvinar neurons suggests that pulvinar neurons might mediate intracortical connections as well as the fast subcortical pathway to the amygdala. These results highlight a role of the pulvinar in the processing of emotional facial stimuli.},

These motions often differ from the motion of the object to which they belong and must therefore be integrated elsewhere. A candidate site for this integration is visual cortical area MT (V5), in which cells with large receptive fields compute the motion of patterns. Previous studies of motion integration in MT have used stimuli that fill the receptive field, and thus do not test whether motion information is really integrated across this whole area. For each MT neuron, we identified two regions (”patches”) within the receptive field that were approximately equally effective in driving responses. We then measured responses to plaids whose component gratings overlapped within a patch, and compared them with responses to the same component gratings presented in separate patches. Cells that were selective for the direction of motion of the whole pattern when the gratings overlapped lost this selectivity when the gratings were separated and became selective instead for the direction of motion of the individual components. If MT cells simply pooled all of the inputs that endow them with a receptive field, they would encode all of the motions in the receptive field as belonging to a single object. Our results indicate instead that critical elements of the computations underlying pattern-direction selectivity in MT are done locally, on a scale smaller than the whole receptive field.},

In addition, a ‘common gene set’, comprised of target genes belonging to a mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase signaling pathway, was regulated by vision at all ages but was impervious to prior history of sensory experience. Together, our results demonstrate that vision has dual effects on gene regulation in visual cortex and that sensory experience is needed for the sequential acquisition of age-specific, but not common, gene sets. Thus, a dynamic interplay between experience and gene expression drives activity-dependent circuit maturation.},

abstract = {When inspecting visual scenes, primates perform on average four saccadic eye movements per second, which implies that scene segmentation, feature binding, and identification of image components is accomplished in <200 ms. Thus individual neurons can contribute only a small number of discharges for these complex computations, suggesting that information is encoded not only in the discharge rate but also in the timing of action potentials. While monkeys inspected natural scenes we registered, with multielectrodes from primary visual cortex, the discharges of simultaneously recorded neurons. Relating these signals to eye movements revealed that discharge rates peaked around 90 ms after fixation onset and then decreased to near baseline levels within 200 ms. Unitary event analysis revealed that preceding this increase in firing there was an episode of enhanced response synchronization during which discharges of spatially distributed cells coincided within 5-ms windows significantly more often than predicted by the discharge rates. This episode started 30 ms after fixation onset and ended by the time discharge rates had reached their maximum. When the animals scanned a blank screen a small change in firing rate, but no excess synchronization, was observed. The short latency of the stimulation-related synchronization phenomena suggests a fast-acting mechanism for the coordination of spike timing that may contribute to the basic operations of scene segmentation.},

abstract = {To follow an ever-changing auditory scene, the auditory brain is continuously creating a representation of the past to form expectations about the future. Unexpected events will produce an error in the predictions that should “trigger” the network’s response. Indeed, neurons in the auditory midbrain, thalamus and cortex, respond to rarely occurring sounds while adapting to frequently repeated ones, i.e., they exhibit stimulus specific adaptation (SSA). SSA cannot be explained solely by intrinsic membrane properties, but likely involves the participation of the network. Thus, SSA is envisaged as a high order form of adaptation that requires the influence of cortical areas. However, present research supports the hypothesis that SSA, at least in its simplest form (i.e., to frequency deviants), can be transmitted in a bottom-up manner through the auditory pathway. Here, we briefly review the underlying neuroanatomy of the corticofugal projections before discussing state of the art studies which demonstrate that SSA present in the medial geniculate body (MGB) and inferior colliculus (IC) is not inherited from the cortex but can be modulated by the cortex via the corticofugal pathways. By modulating the gain of neurons in the thalamus and midbrain, the auditory cortex (AC) would refine SSA subcortically, preventing irrelevant information from reaching the cortex.},

The role that suppressive mechanisms play in shaping the tuning and dynamics of cortical responses remains the subject of debate. Here we used subspace reverse correlation to study the relationship between suppression by non-optimal stimuli, the spectral-temporal separability of the responses, and their persistence in time. Two clear relationships emerged from our data: cells with inseparable responses were often accompanied by suppression to non-preferred stimuli, while separable responses showed mostly enhancement by their preferred stimuli. Additionally, inseparable responses were characterized by a longer persistence in time com-pared to those with separable dynamics. A parametric model that assumes the additive combination of separable enhancement and suppression signals, with suppression con-strained to be low-pass in spatial frequency and untuned for orientation, explained the data well. These new findings, in addition to an established correlation between selectivity and suppression for non-optimal stimuli, clarify how the dynamics and selectivity of cortical responses are shaped by suppressive signals and how their interplay generates the large diversity of responses observed in primary visual cortex.},

We measured changes in RF size in simple cells recorded from the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaques by measuring their first-order spatio-temporal kernels and fitting them with two-dimensional Gabor functions at different time slices. We found that the width and length of the RF envelope and the period of the carrier tend to decrease during the time-course of the response. The most pronounced changes are seen in the width and spatial period of the RFs, which decrease by 15% during the central 20 ms of the response. These results show a novel form of spatio-temporal inseparability in simple cells and are consistent with the notion of a coarse-to-fine processing of information in early visual cortex.},

abstract = {We performed a systematic analysis of phase locking in pairs of electrically coupled neocortical fast-spiking (FS) and low-threshold-spiking (LTS) interneurons and in a conductance-based model of a pair of FS cells. Phase–response curves (PRCs) were obtained for real interneurons and the model cells. We used PRCs and the theory of weakly coupled oscillators to make predictions about phase-locking characteristics of cell pairs. Phase locking and the robustness of phase-locked states to differences in intrinsic frequencies of cells were directly examined by driving interneuron pairs through a wide range of firing frequencies. Calculations using PRCs accurately predicted that electrical coupling robustly synchronized the firing of interneurons over all frequencies studied (FS, 25–80 Hz; LTS, 10–30 Hz). The synchronizing ability of electrical coupling and the robustness of the phase-locked states were directly dependent on the strength of coupling but not on firing frequency. The FS cell model also predicted the existence of stable antiphase firing at frequencies below 30 Hz, but no evidence for stable antiphase firing was found using the experimentally determined PRCs or in direct measures of phase locking in pairs of interneurons. Despite significant differences in biophysical properties of FS and LTS cells, their phase-locking behavior was remarkably similar. The wide spikes and shallow action potential afterhyperpolarizations of interneurons, compared with the model, prohibited antiphase behavior. Electrical coupling becortical interneurons of the same type maintained robust synchronous firing of cell pairs for up to 10% heterogeneity in their intrinsic frequencies.},

abstract = {The idea of sex differences in the brain both fascinates and inflames the public. As a result, the communication and public discussion of new findings is particularly vulnerable to logical leaps and pseudoscience. A new US National Institutes of Health policy to consider both sexes in almost all preclinical research will increase the number of reported sex differences and thus the risk that research in this important area will be misinterpreted and misrepresented. In this article, I consider ways in which we might reduce that risk, for example, by (i) employing statistical tests that reveal the extent to which sex explains variation, rather than whether or not the sexes ‘differ’, (ii) properly characterizing the frequency distributions of scores or dependent measures, which nearly always overlap, and (iii) avoiding speculative functional or evolutionary explanations for sex-based variation, which usually invoke logical fallacies and perpetuate sex stereotypes. Ultimately, the factor of sex should be viewed as an imperfect, temporary proxy for yet-unknown factors, such as hormones or sex-linked genes, that explain variation better than sex. As scientists, we should be interested in discovering and understanding the true sources of variation, which will be more informative in the development of clinical treatments.},

Nevertheless, stimulation well outside of the classical receptive ﬁeld can exert clear and signiﬁcant effects on visual processing. Given the distances over which they occur, the retinal mechanisms responsible for these long-range effects would certainly require signal propagation via active membrane properties. Here the physiology of a wide-ﬁeld amacrine cell—the wiry cell—in macaque monkey retina is explored, revealing receptive ﬁelds that represent a striking departure from the classic structure. A single wiry cell integrates signals over wide regions of retina, 5–10 times larger than the classic receptive ﬁelds of most retinal ganglion cells. Wiry cells integrate signals over space much more effectively than predicted from passive signal propagation, and spatial integration is strongly attenuated during blockade of NMDA spikes but integra- tion is insensitive to blockade of Na V channels with TTX. Thus these cells appear well suited for contributing to the long-range interactions of visual signals that characterize many aspects of visual perception.},

These authors measured population responses expressed as a function of the optimal orientation of long drifting bars. They then varied bar length, direction, and speed and found that stimuli of a same orientation can elicit different population responses and stimuli with different orientation can elicit similar population responses. We asked whether these results can be explained from known properties of V1 receptive fields. We implemented an “energy model” where a receptive field integrates stimulus energy over a region of three-dimensional frequency space. The population of receptive fields defines a volume of visibility, which covers all orientations and a plausible range of spatial and temporal frequencies. This energy model correctly predicts the population response to bars of different length, direction, and speed and explains the observations made with optical imaging. The model also readily explains a related phenomenon, the appearance of motion streaks for fast-moving dots. We conclude that the energy model can be applied to activation maps of V1 and predicts phenomena that may otherwise appear to be surprising. These results indicate that maps obtained with optical imaging reflect the layout of neurons selective for stimulus energy, not for isolated stimulus features such as orientation, direction, and speed.},

Here we show that these mechanisms are matched to the statistics of the environment. First, we measured the joint distribution of luminance and contrast in patches selected from natural images and found that luminance and contrast were statistically independent of each other. This independence did not hold for artificial images with matched spectral characteristics. Second, we characterized the effects of the adaptive mechanisms in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the direct recipient of retinal outputs. We found that luminance gain control had the same effect at all contrasts and that contrast gain control had the same effect at all mean luminances. Thus, the adaptive mechanisms for luminance and contrast operate independently, reflecting the very independence encountered in natural images.},

Testing with our kinetic boundary stimuli always occurred under optimized conditions. To this end, the preferred direction, speed, stimulus position, and stimulus size of each cell were determined by quantitative tests. 3. The orientation selectivity to stationary luminance contrast edges served as a reference by which a response to kinetic boundaries could be compared. We found cells in area MT to be less selective to the orientation of luminance contrast stimuli than to the direction of motion. We confirmed the presence of neurons with preferred orientation aligned with their preferred direction. 4. The responses to kinetic edges defined by motion vectors moving in opposite directions, kinetic gratings with motion vectors in opposite directions, kinetic edges containing coherent motion and a stationary complementary field or coherent motion and a complementary field containing visual dynamic noise were compared. Kinetic boundaries were generated so that the motion vectors moved either parallel or orthogonal to the orientation of the discontinuity. For a cell to be considered as responding to the orientation of a kinetic boundary, it had to exhibit the same preferred orientation when the local motion vectors changed from parallel to orthogonal to the orientation of the kinetic boundary. 5. All cells in area MT changed their preferred orientation by 90 degrees when the coherent motion vectors changed from moving parallel to moving orthogonal to the boundary. This was the case independent of the types of kinetic boundary tested. We concluded that cells in area MT appear to respond to the motion vector over their classical receptive field (CRF) only and were unable to code the orientation of the kinetic boundary. 6. In those cells exhibiting an antagonistic surround, we examined the ability of the cell to code the position of a kinetic boundary. None of the cells tested signaled the position of a kinetic boundary. The side preference of the stimulus of the cells changed from left to right as the motion vectors in the stimulus reversed. This indicates that the cells were only selective for the motion vectors present over their CRF. 7. We found that the directional sensitivity of cells in area MT remained unaltered by the presence of additional motion vectors within the CRF. This suggests that cells in area MT extract a specific motion vector from a spatial configuration of vectors.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {We recorded responses in 107 cells in the primary visual area V1 and 113 cells in the extrastriate visual area V2 while presenting a kinetically defined edge or a luminance contrast edge. Cells meeting statistical criteria for responsiveness and orientation selectivity were classified as selective for the orientation of the kinetic edge if the preferred orientation for a kinetic boundary stimulus remained essentially the same even when the directions of the two motion components defining that boundary were changed by 90 degrees. In area V2, 13 of the 113 cells met all three requirements, whereas in V1, only 4 cells met the criteria of 107 that were tested, and even these demonstrated relatively weak selectivity. Correlation analysis showed that V1 and V2 populations differed greatly (P < 1.0 x 10(-6), Student’s t-test) in their selectively for specific orientations of kinetic edge stimuli. Neurons in V2 that were selective for the orientation of a kinetic boundary were further distinguished from their counterparts in V1 in displaying a strong, sharply tuned response to a luminance edge of the same orientation. We concluded that selectivity for the orientation of kinetically defined boundaries first emerges in area V2 rather than in primary visual cortex. An analysis of response onset latencies in V2 revealed that cells selective for the orientation of the motion-defined boundary responded about 40 ms more slowly, on average, to the kinetic edge stimulus than to a luminance edge. In nonselective cells, that is, those presumably responding only to the local motion in the stimulus, this difference was only about 20 ms. Response latencies for the luminance edge were indistinguishable in KE-selective and -nonselective neurons. We infer that while responses to luminance edges or local motion are indigenous to V2, KE-selective responses may involve feedback entering the ventral stream at a point downstream with respect to V2.},

abstract = {The responses of many neurons in primary visual cortex are modulated by stimuli outside the classical receptive field in ways that may contribute to integrative processes like scene segmentation. To explore this issue, single-unit neuronal responses were recorded in monkey cortical areas V1 and V2 to visual stimuli containing either a figure or a background pattern over the receptive field. Figures were defined either by orientation contrast or by illusory contours. In all conditions, the stimulation over the RF and its nearby surround was identical. Both figure types enhanced the average population response in V1 and V2. For orientation contrast figures, enhancement averaged 50% in V2 and 30% in V1; for illusory contour figures, the enhancement averaged 24% in V2 and 18% in V1. These differences were statistically significant for figure type but not for visual area. In V2, the latency of enhancement to illusory contour-defined figures was longer than that to orientation-defined figures. Neuronal responses were recorded while the monkey performed a directed-attention task. Enhancement to both figure types was observed even when attention was directed away from the figure. Attention slightly enhanced responses in V2, independent of figure type, but did not affect responses in V1. There was no discernible effect of attention on background firing rate in either V1 or V2. These results suggest that scene segmentation is a distributed process, in which neuronal signals at successive stages of the visual hierarchy and over time increasingly reflect the global structure of the image. This process occurs independent of directed visual attention.},

abstract = {Motivated by the recent physiological finding that a neuron’s receptive field can increase in size by a factor of 2-4-fold at low contrast [Nat. Neurosci. 2 (1999) 733, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 96 (1999) 12073], we sought to examine whether a psychophysical task might reflect the contrast dependent changes in the size/structure of a receptive field. We postulate that since spatial summation is not contrast invariant, a task that relies on the spatial structure of a receptive field, such as orientation discrimination, should also be affected by changes in contrast. Previously, orientation discrimination thresholds have been reported to be roughly independent of the contrast of a stimulus for most of the visible range of contrasts [i.e. J. Neurophysiol. 57 (1987) 773, J. Opt. Soc. Am. 6 (1989) 713, Vis. Res. 30 (1990) 449, Vis. Res. 39 (1999) 1631]. Here, we found large improvements in orientation discrimination with contrast that were dependent on stimulus area. Furthermore, the apparent constancy of orientation discrimination for large area stimuli is possibly a result of a floor effect on the threshold. Therefore we conclude that there is not strong evidence for contrast invariant orientation discrimination. We interpret these results in the context of recent neurophysiological results about the expansion of cortical cells’ receptive fields at low contrast.},

We find that observers’ orientation judgments depend on surround contextual information, with performance being optimal when the center and surround stimuli are clearly distinct. In cases where the center and surround were not clearly segregated, we report two sets of results. If there was an ambiguity regarding the perception of a global structure (i.e. a small mismatch between local cues), observers’ performance was impaired. If there was no mismatch and local and global cues were consistent with the perception of a single surface, observers performed as well as in the distinct surfaces case. Although some of our results can be largely accounted for by interactions between differently oriented filters, other aspects are more difficult to reconcile with this explanation. We suggest that low level filtering constrains observers’ performance, and that influences arising from image segmentation modify how local orientation signals are pooled together},

These computational hierarchical models make strong predictions concerning the roles of feedforward (FF) and feedback (FB) pathways, including their segregation and topographical precision in both directions. This shows that instead of a single stream in the upper and lower compartments of the cortex there is in fact a bi-directional counter-stream in each compartment of the cortex.

A weight index (extrinsic fraction of labeled neurons [FLNe]) was determined for each area-to-area pathway. Newly found projections were weaker on average compared with the known projections; nevertheless, the 2 sets of pathways had extensively overlapping weight distributions. Repeat injections across individuals revealed modest FLNe variability given the range of FLNe values (standard deviation <1 log unit, range 5 log units). The connectivity profile for each area conformed to a lognormal distribution, where a majority of projections are moderate or weak in strength. In the G29 x 29 interareal subgraph, two-thirds of the connections that can exist do exist. Analysis of the smallest set of areas that collects links from all 91 nodes of the G29 x 91 subgraph (dominating set analysis) confirms the dense (66%) structure of the cortical matrix. The G29 x 29 subgraph suggests an unexpectedly high incidence of unidirectional links. The directed and weighted G29 x 91 connectivity matrix for the macaque will be valuable for comparison with connectivity analyses in other species, including humans.

abstract = {A radial grating stimulus was used to assess the effect of stimulation of the region beyond the classical surround of monkey lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) receptive fields. The effect was measured by the differences in the responsiveness of the LGN cell center to small flashing spots between two conditions: (1) grating stationary or (2) grating rotating. The grating was present only in regions beyond the classical center and surround. The rotating grating produced changes in the flash-evoked spike response but not in the spontaneous activity in about half of the X cells and all of the Y cells. The direction of the effect was independent of the sign of the receptive field center. In a control experiment, cryogenic blockade of striate cortex reversed the effect in all cells tested. The grating effect was still present for cells having fields in that part of visual space beyond the region represented by the cooled cortical area. The effect was not a result of activation of classical extra-receptive field influences, since cells showing the effect did not exhibit shift or periphery effects or outer disinhibitory surrounds. The effect was not seen in recordings from intrageniculate retinal axons. We conclude that the radial grating effects LGN cell responsivity by activation of the corticogeniculate pathway.},

abstract = {Cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of the macaque monkey were investigated with microelectrodes in an attempt to develop an overall classification scheme. We classified cells in the parvocellular (P) and magnocellular (M) layers according to (non)linearity of spatial summation, shock latency, and chromatic organization of center and surround. We also measured the spatial and temporal tuning to counterphasing and drifting sine wave gratings and tested for periphery effects. Our results showed that no strict laminar segregation existed for any cell property studied. Our results can be summarized as follows: 1. Most P layer cells showed a linear summation (98%) and color-opponent responses (80%), while other cells showed a nonlinear summation (Y-cells, 2%) and broad band responses (28%). In contrast, 37% of the M layer cells were linear summators and the remainder were nonlinear. Therefore, there are overlapping distributions of X- and Y-cells in P and M layers but not a strict segregation. 2. P layer cells had longer shock latencies than M layer cells. X-cells conducted more slowly (2.4 +/- 0.7 msec) than Y-cells (1.6 +/- 0.8 msec), but there were overlapping distributions. Latency shortened gradually, rather than abruptly, with increasing depth. 3. The first harmonic of X- and Y-cell responses was maximally sensitive to spatial frequencies of about 2 cycles/deg. Each type of cell modulated about a mean rate to a drifting grating, although Y-cells had higher distortion than X-cells. Response amplitudes to drifting gratings were higher for MX- and MY- than for PX-cells. No DC elevation to high spatial frequencies was seen. Spatial bandwidths averaged 2 to 5 octaves. X-cells were maximally tuned to temporal frequencies around 11 Hz, and Y-cells were tuned to about 19 Hz; temporal bandwidths for both averaged 2.8 octaves. 4. Periphery effects were detected in 4% of the X-cells and 25% of the Y-cells. 5. These data indicate that gradual changes occur between dorsal and ventral layers: summation changes from linear to nonlinear; conduction latencies shorten; peak temporal tuning increases; response amplitudes increase; the periphery effect becomes more prevalent. Spatial tuning does not change. No strict laminar segregation or specificity exists for any of the properties that we studied.},

Surprisingly, the superficial 75 mum region contains anterior and posterior direction-selective neurons (DSLGNs) intermingled with nondirection-selective neurons, while upward- and downward-selective neurons are nearly absent. Unexpectedly, the remaining neurons encode both anterior and posterior directions, forming horizontal motion-axis selectivity. A model of random wiring consistent with these results makes quantitative predictions about the connectivity of direction-selective retinal ganglion cell (DSRGC) inputs to the superficial dLGN. DSLGNs are more sharply tuned than DSRGCs. These results suggest that dLGN maintains and sharpens retinal direction selectivity and integrates opposing DSRGC subtypes in a functional-anatomical region, perhaps forming a feature representation for horizontal-axis motion, contrary to dLGN being a simple relay. Furthermore, they support recent conjecture that cortical direction and orientation selectivity emerge in part from a previously undescribed motion-selective retinogeniculate pathway.},

abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex of many mammals are clustered according to their preference to stimulus parameters such as orientation and spatial frequency. Nevertheless, responses to complex visual stimuli are highly heterogeneous between adjacent neurons. To investigate the relation between these observations, we recorded from pairs of neighboring neurons in area 17 of anesthetized cats in response to stimuli of differing complexity: sinusoidal drifting gratings, binary dense noise, and natural movies. Comparisons of the tuning curves revealed similar orientation and direction preferences for neighboring neurons, but large differences in preferred phase, direction selectivity, and tuning width of spatial frequency. No pair was similar across all tuning properties. The neurons’ firing rates averaged across multiple stimulus repetitions (the “signal”) were also compared. Binned between 10 and 200 ms, the correlation between these signals was close to zero in the median across all pairs for all stimulus classes. Signal correlations agreed poorly with differences in tuning properties, except for receptive field offset and relative modulation (i.e., the strength of phase modulation). Nonetheless, signal correlations for different stimulus classes were well correlated with each other, even for gratings and movies. Conversely, trial-to-trial fluctuations (termed “noise”) were poorly correlated between neighboring neurons, suggesting low degrees of common input. In response to gratings and visual noise, signal and noise correlations were well correlated with each other, but less so for responses to movies. These findings have relevance for our understanding of the processing of natural stimuli in a functionally heterogeneous cortical network.},

abstract = {Neurons at early stages of the visual cortex signal elemental features, such as pieces of contour, but how these signals are organized into perceptual objects is unclear. Theories have proposed that spiking synchrony between these neurons encodes how features are grouped (binding-by-synchrony), but recent studies did not find the predicted increase in synchrony with binding. Here we propose that features are grouped to “proto-objects” by intrinsic feedback circuits that enhance the responses of the participating feature neurons. This hypothesis predicts synchrony exclusively between feature neurons that receive feedback from the same grouping circuit. We recorded from neurons in macaque visual cortex and used border-ownership selectivity, an intrinsic property of the neurons, to infer whether or not two neurons are part of the same grouping circuit. We found that binding produced synchrony between same-circuit neurons, but not between other pairs of neurons, as predicted by the grouping hypothesis. In a selective attention task, synchrony emerged with ignored as well as attended objects, and higher synchrony was associated with faster behavioral responses, as would be expected from early grouping mechanisms that provide the structure for object-based processing. Thus, synchrony could be produced by automatic activation of intrinsic grouping circuits. However, the binding-related elevation of synchrony was weak compared with its random fluctuations, arguing against synchrony as a code for binding. In contrast, feedback grouping circuits encode binding by modulating the response strength of related feature neurons. Thus, our results suggest a novel coding mechanism that might underlie the proto-objects of perception.},

abstract = {We have studied the neuronal circuitry and structure-function relationships of single neurones in the striate visual cortex of the cat using a combination of electrophysiological and anatomical techniques. Glass micropipettes filled with horseradish peroxidase were used to record extracellularly from single neurones. After studying the receptive field properties, the afferent inputs of the neurones were studied by determining their latency of response to electrical stimulation at different positions along the optic pathway. Some cells were thus classified as receiving a mono- or polysynaptic input from afferents of the lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.), via X- or Y-like retinal ganglion cells. Two striking correlations were found between dendritic morphology and receptive field type. All spiny stellate cells, and all star pyramidal cells in layer 4A, had receptive fields with spatially separate on and off subfields (S-type receptive fields). All the identified afferent input to these, the major cell types in layer 4, was monosynaptic from X- or Y-like afferents. Neurones receiving monosynaptic X- or Y-like input were not strictly segregated in layer 4 and the lower portion of layer 3. Nevertheless the X- and Y-like l.g.n. fibres did not converge on any of the single neurones so far studied. Monosynaptic input from the l.g.n. afferents was not restricted to cells lying within layers 4 and 6, the main termination zones of the l.g.n. afferents, but was also received by cells lying in layers 3 and 5. The projection pattern of cells receiving monosynaptic input differed widely, depending on the laminar location of the cell soma. This suggests the presence of a number of divergent paths within the striate cortex. Cells receiving indirect input from the l.g.n. afferents were located mainly within layers 2, 3 and 5. Most pyramidal cells in layer 3 had axons projecting out of the striate cortex, while many axons of the layer 5 pyramids did not. The layer 5 cells showed the most morphological variation of any layer, were the most difficult to activate by electrical stimulation, and contained some cells which responded with the longest latencies of any cells in the striate cortex. This suggests that they were several synapses distant from the l.g.n. input. The majority of cells in layers 2, 3, 4 and 6 had the same basic S-type receptive field structure. Only layer 5 contained a majority of cells with spatially overlapping on and off subfields (C- and B-type receptive fields).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

In particular, the orientation selectivity and size of the receptive fields of cortical neurones were examined for their relationship to the tangential organization of the dendrites of cortical neurones. Single neurones in the visual cortex of anaesthetized and paralysed cats were physiologically characterized and injected intracellularly with horseradish peroxidase (HRP). In some cases it was possible to identify whether the neurones received direct (monosynaptic) or indirect (polysynaptic) input from afferents of the lateral geniculate nucleus. The dendritic arborizations of the HRP-filled cells, sampled from all layers, were reconstructed in three dimensions with computer assistance, and rotated to give the tangential or surface view. The bias in the tangential arrangement of the dendrites was determined by calculating the mean vector angle for the distribution of the dendrites of each cell. This bias was related to the orientation selectivity of the neurones. There was no consistent relationship between orientation selectivity and the tangential bias of the dendritic tree. The width of the receptive fields was compared to the equivalent ‘width’ of the tangential extent of the dendrites. There was no significant relationship between the two widths. The tangential arrangement of the dendritic field does not appear to be important in determining the orientation selectivity or the size of the receptive fields of neurones in the cat visual cortex. The former feature of the receptive fields may be determined by inhibitory processes, while the extent and number of the afferents providing input to a single neurone may determine the latter property.},

In spite of the extensive experimental and theoretical effort over the past 50 years, it has been difficult to establish how this diversity of functional-response properties emerges in the cortex. One of the reasons is that while functional studies in the early visual pathway have been usually carried out in vivo with extracellular recording techniques, investigations about the precise structure of the cortical network have mainly been conducted in vitro. Thus, the link between structure and function has rarely been explicitly established, remaining a well-known controversial issue. In this chapter, I review recent data that simultaneously combines anatomy with physiology at the intracellular level; trying to understand how the primary visual cortex transforms the information it receives from the thalamus to generate receptive-field structure, contrast-invariant orientation tuning and other functional-response properties.},

abstract = {One of the most salient features to emerge in visual cortex is sensitivity to stimulus orientation. Here we asked if orientation selectivity, once established, is altered by successive stages of cortical processing. We measured patterns of orientation selectivity at all depths of the cat’s visual cortex by making whole-cell recordings with dye-filled electrodes. Our results show that the synaptic representation of orientation indeed changes with position in the microcircuit, as information passes from layer 4 to layer 2+3 to layer 5. At the earliest cortical stage, for simple cells in layer 4, orientation tuning curves for excitation (depolarization) and inhibition (hyperpolarization) had similar peaks (within 0-7 deg, n = 11) and bandwidths. Further, the sharpness of orientation selectivity covaried with receptive field geometry (r = 0.74) - the more elongated the strongest subregion, the shaper the tuning. Tuning curves for complex cells in layer 2+3 also had similar peaks (within 0-4 deg, n = 7) and bandwidths. By contrast, at a later station, layer 5, the preferred orientation for excitation and inhibition diverged such that the peaks of the tuning curves could be as far as 90 deg apart (average separation, 54 deg; n = 6). Our results support the growing consensus that orientation selectivity is generated at the earliest cortical level and structured similarly for excitation and inhibition. Moreover, our novel finding that the relative tuning of excitation and inhibition changes with laminar position helps resolve prior controversy about orientation selectivity at later phases of processing and gives a mechanistic view of how the cortical circuitry recodes orientation.},

Proponents of the encapsulation thesis, however, often argue that, when correctly interpreted, these psychological findings are compatible with the thesis. In our view, the debate over the significance and the correct interpretation of these psychological findings has reached an impasse. We hold that this impasse is due to the methodological limitations over psychophysical experiments, and it is very unlikely that such experiments, on their own, could yield results that would settle the debate.

This paper describes receptive-field properties and a new system of classification for LGN X-cells that appear to receive essentially only one excitatory retinal input. These X-cells were of two distinct classes. The visual responses of one class of cell (XS, single) replicated the basic form of the responses of a retinal X-cell. The other class of cell (XL, lagged) had responses with two remarkable features: their firing lagged 40-80 ms behind that of XS-cells or ganglion cells at response onset, and they fired anomalously at times when XS-cells or ganglion cells would not be firing. Thus, for a flashing spot, XL-cells were inhibited from firing after stimulus onset, during the time when XS-cells or retinal X-cells had an initial transient peak in firing; XL-cells generally had an anomalous peak in firing after stimulus offset, after XS-cells or retinal X-cells had stopped firing. For a moving bar, XS-cells or retinal X-cells responded primarily while the bar was in the receptive-field center, whereas most of a typical XL-cell’s response occurred after the bar had left the receptive-field center. The latencies of various features in the visual responses were analyzed. For several visual response latencies, the distribution was clearly bimodal, thus objectively demonstrating the existence of two cell classes. Using only the latencies from spot and bar responses, over 90% of these single-input cells could be reliably identified as belonging to one of the two classes. The remaining cells (7 of 128) were intermediate between the two classes in some but not all respects; because they had some properties in common, these cells were kept in a separate group (XPL, partially lagged). The axons of both XS- and XL-cells could be antidromically activated from visual cortex. Cortical latencies were typically 0.7-2.0 ms for XS-cells but much longer, typically 2.4-5.0 ms, for XL-cells. It is possible that XL-cells have not previously been recognized as a separate class because cells with such long latencies have been recorded infrequently in the past. Responses to central flashing spots were more transient than those of retinal X-cells for most XS-cells and more sustained for most XL-cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The retinal inputs to cells in the cat’s lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) were directly recorded to study the basis for the properties of two classes of LGN X-cells: Xs (single) and XL (lagged). The presence of excitatory or inhibitory input to an LGN cell from a particular simultaneously recorded ganglion cell was assessed with cross-correlograms during unstimulated activity. Because neighboring ganglion cells do not fire independently, features in a retinogeniculate correlogram can arise in two ways that must be distinguished by a direct effect of the ganglion cell on the LGN cell, or by correlated firing between that ganglion cell and some other ganglion cell that is an excitatory or inhibitory input to the LGN cell. It was possible to determine the origin of correlogram features because features indicating a retinogeniculate effect were distinctly different in timing and strength from features arising solely from correlated firing in the retina. The characteristic feature in a correlogram between an LGN cell and an excitatory retinal input was a sharp peak in LGN cell firing rate at the appropriate latency after the firing of the ganglion cell. The characteristic feature for an inhibitory input was a dip in LGN cell firing rate after the firing of the ganglion cell. Typically, this dip lasted 10-40 ms and was followed by a prolonged enhancement in LGN cell firing rate, which may reflect a postinhibitory rebound. XS-cells had a single retinal X input whose excitatory effect caused most of the LGN cell’s spikes during stimulated and unstimulated activity. There was no conclusive evidence that any XS-cell received excitatory retinal input from either Y-cells or other X-cells of the same center sign. There was usually evidence for inhibition of XS-cells by retinal X-cells of opposite center sign with receptive fields highly overlapping that of the XS-cell, but rarely evidence for inhibition by Y-cells. XL-cells also had only a single excitatory input, but this X input had a relatively weak effect that caused only a minority of the LGN cell’s spikes, typically 17% during maintained activity and 29% during visual stimulation. The input’s excitatory effect was immediately followed by strong inhibition of the XL-cell. XL-cells were also inhibited by retinal X-cells of the same center sign that were adjacent (nearest neighbors) to the excitatory input. The strength and latency of both of these inhibitory effects indicate that the inhibition was disynaptic.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Even in the absence of visual stimulation, retinal ganglion cells have a substantial maintained discharge. This maintained discharge is not generated independently within each ganglion cell, because the unstimulated activity of two neighboring ganglion cells can be remarkably correlated. These correlations show that two such cells respond together to strong, spontaneous signals from more distal retinal neurons and that, in some cases, ganglion cells even have effects on each other. Observations of correlated firing can give insights not only into the sources of maintained activity but also into retinal connections and signal processing. Correlating firing at the retinal level also has important implications for the use of correlation analysis to study connections between cells in higher visual centers. Much recent attention has focused on the role that correlated firing may play in forming appropriate, ordered connections to a target structure.},

abstract = {Frogs are essentially dependent on vision. They fccd on worms, flies, and other insects which they catch directly with the mouth or by striking them with the tongue; for this they use only visual clues. Furthermore, frogs prey only on moving insects, and their attention is never attracted by stationary creatures or objects. Nor do they respond with feeding behavior to a large moving object, instead it provokes an escape reaction. For them, a form deprived of movement SCClnS to bc behaviorally meaningless. Frogs, then, appear to recognize their prey and select it for attack from among all other environmental objects because it exhibits a number of features such as move- ment, a certain size, some contrast, and, perhaps, also a certain color. Further- more, this ability of frogs to recognize their prey and to snap at it is not altered by changes in the general environment. Just as wc arc able to read and to recognize shapes under the most varied conditions, so arc frogs able to scc their prey and to fccd upon it under the bright light of midday or under the twilight of morning or evening, whether this bc in their natural environment or in a small cage in the laboratory.

How is this accomplished? How do frogs recognize the universals, prey and enemy?

To survive, a frog needs to react rapidly, either to catch a prey or to escape an enemy. To do this, the pattern of light and dark that is the original image formed on the retina has to be anaJyzed, sooner or later, to select from it the features which define the universals.},

Cortical connections were assigned to specific visual areas on the basis of their relationship to the pattern of interhemispheric connections, revealed by staining for degeneration following callosal transection. MT was shown to be reciprocally connected with many topographically organized cortical visual areas, including V1, V2, V3, and V4. These pathways link regions representing corresponding portions of the visual field in the different areas. In addition, MT has reciprocal connections with two previously unidentified cortical areas, which we have designated the medial superior temporal area (MST) and the ventral intraparietal area (VIP). The laminar distribution of terminals and cell bodies in cortical areas connected with MT follows a consistent pattern. In areas V1, V2, and V3, the projections to MT arise largely or exclusively from cells in supragranular layers, and the reciprocal connections from MT terminate mainly in supragranular and infragranular layers. In contrast, the projections to MST and VIP terminate mainly in layer IV, and the reciprocal pathways originate from cells in both superficial and deep layers. On the basis of this pattern, each connection can be designated as forward or feedback in nature, and a hierarchical arrangement of visual areas can be determined. In this hierarchy, MT is at a higher level than V1, V2, and V3, and at a lower level than MST and VIP. Subcortical projections were seen from MT to the claustrum, the putamen, the caudate nucleus, the inferior and lateral subdivisions of the pulvinar complex, the ventral lateral geniculate nucleus, the reticular nucleus of the thalamus, the superior colliculus, and the pontine nuclei Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

abstract = {The information transfer in the thalamus is blocked dynamically during sleep, in conjunction with the occurrence of spindle waves. In order to describe the dynamic mechanisms which control the sensory transfer of information, it is necessary to have a qualitative model for the response properties of thalamic neurons. As the theoretical understanding of the mechanism remains incomplete, we analyze two modeling approaches for a recent experiment by Le Masson et al. [Nature (London) 417, 854 (2002)] on the thalamocortical loop. We use a conductance based model in order to motivate an extension of the Hindmarsh-Rose model, which mimics experimental observations of Le Masson et al. Typically, thalamic neurons possess two different firing modes, depending on their membrane potential. At depolarized potentials, the cells fire in a single spike mode and relay synaptic inputs in a one-to-one manner to the cortex. If the cell gets hyperpolarized, T-type calcium currents generate burst-mode firing which leads to a decrease in the spike transfer. In thalamocortical circuits, the cell membrane gets hyperpolarized by recurrent inhibitory feedback loops. In the case of reciprocally coupled excitatory and inhibitory neurons, inhibitory feedback leads to metastable self-sustained scillations, which mask the incoming input, and thereby reduce the information transfer significantly.},

An equivalent comparison was also made while participants actually perceived object and non-object drawings. Although these two conditions engaged both hemispheres, activation was significantly stronger in the left occipito-temporo-frontal network during mental inspection of object than of non-object drawings. This network was also activated when perception of object drawings was compared to that of non-object drawings. An interaction was nonetheless observed: this effect was stronger during imagery than during perception in the left inferior frontal and the left inferior temporal gyrus. Although the tasks subjects performed did not explicitly require semantic analysis, activation of this network probably reflected, at least in part, a semantic and possibly a verbal retrieval component when object drawings were processed. Mental imagery tasks elicited activation of early visual cortex at a lower level than perception tasks. In the context of the imagery debate, these findings indicate that, as previously suggested, figurative imagery could involve primary visual cortex and adjacent areas.},

We studied a PN population, stimulated with five odorants and pulse durations between 0.3 and 10 s. Odor representations were characterized as time series of vectors of PN activity, constructed from the firing rates of all PNs in successive 50 ms time bins. Odor representations by the PN population can be described as trajectories in PN state space with three main phases: an on transient, lasting 1–2 s; a fixed point, stable for at least 8 s; and an off transient, lasting a few seconds as activity returns to baseline. Whereas all three phases are odor specific, optimal stimulus separation occurred during the transients rather than the fixed points. In addition, the PNs’ own target neurons respond least when their PN-population input stabilized at a fixed point. Steady-state measures of activity thus seem inappropriate to understand the neural code in this system.},

abstract = {The relationship between behavioral state, discharge pattern, and discharge rate was investigated in 26 lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) units recorded in cats in the dark during waking (W), synchronized sleep (S), and desynchronized sleep (D). A distinctive state-dependent discharge pattern was the presence of stereotyped bursts of 2-7 spikes that occurred in 63% of the units. These bursts were most frequent in S, much less frequent in D, and rarely occurred in W. Lack of association with discharge rate changes between states showed the bursting to be a true state-dependent phenomenon. A burst consisted of 2-7 spikes, with each successive interspike interval being longer than the preceding one; in the 200 ms prior to burst occurrence, discharge probability decreased markedly. This structure of burst organization suggested a model of generation wherein each burst was caused by a unitary event of varying intensity, perhaps a rebound following a hyperpolarization. Spectral and autocorrelational analyses showed bursts occurred rhythmically in three cells at a frequency of 3-4 Hz and in two cells at a frequency of 10-12 Hz, indicating a possible linkage with slow-wave generators. While the number of bursts in the various behavioral states was a state-dependent phenomena, other aspects of discharge pattern were shown to be rate dependent. To evaluate discharge pattern apart from the occurrence of bursts, a “primary event spike train” was formed; this consisted of individual spikes and the first spike of each burst. This analysis showed that, within S, the probability of burst occurrence was highest when the primary spike rate was low. Quantitative analyses showed that first-order pattern measures (the form of the interspike interval histogram, IH) were dependent on the mean interspike interval (ISI, the inverse of mean rate). This association explained 83-89% of the variance in a power series approximation of IH form. Joint interval histograms (JIH) were used to evaluate the signature of bursts and of the form of the primary spike train. As with interval histograms, the main features of the form of the primary spike JIH were dependent on the primary spike rate. Thus, we concluded that first- and second-order discharge patterns of primary events were rate dependent and not state dependent. Our data are compatible with a model where in the absence of retinal input, the frequency of LGN primary spikes over behavioral state changes is largely determined by brain stem reticular formation input.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Here, we take a fresh look at this model but refocused in the context of sexual differentiation of non-reproductive parameters and with an emphasis on the hippocampus, a telencephalic brain structure predominantly involved in cognition and stress regulation. We explore sex differences in morphology, neurochemistry, and hippocampal-dependent behaviors to propose a new prototype that can be used to explain and further investigate the effects of steroid hormones, those synthesized gonadally or intracerebrally, on hippocampal development and function. We also propose that a new vernacular be employed, one that distinguishes hormonally modulated responses from sex differences, and argue these are mechanistically and functionally distinct. Understanding when and how the sexes are different is as important as understanding when and how they are the same, at the biological, social, and cultural level.},

abstract = {The response of monkey lateral geniculate nucleus (l.g.n.) cells to flashing spots, annuli, and drifting sine-wave gratings were recorded with tungsten micro-electrodes. These stimuli were presented (a) monocularly, through an aperture in the centre of a radial grating, or (b) dichoptically, in which the spots or drifting gratings were presented to the dominant eye’s receptive field, while the centre of the radial grating was positioned on the corresponding retinal location of the other eye. Movement of the radial grating produced changes in the l.g.n. cell responses evoked by the spots and sine-wave gratings. These changes were reversed by cryogenic blockade of the striate cortex. Therefore, radial grating movement altered the responses of l.g.n. cells by activating the corticogeniculate (c.g.) pathway. In about half of all cells, radial grating-induced alterations of centre, or surround, or both responses to spots and annuli were produced. By adopting a simple spatial filtering model of the centre and surround mechanisms, it was possible to predict how these alterations in centre/surround balance would affect the cell’s responses to sine-wave gratings. Alterations were observed in the peak and band width of the spatial and/or temporal tuning curves. The radial gratings did not alter the spatial summation properties of cells. Minor alterations in the spectral neutral points of chromatically opponent neurones were occasionally found. These results are interpreted as support for the view that spatial and temporal tuning are dynamic properties of some l.g.n. neurones by virtue of descending input from the visual cortex.},

abstract = {1. We used the Karhunen-Loeve (K-L) transform to quantify the temporal distribution of spikes in the responses of lateral geniculate (LGN) neurons. The basis functions of the K-L transform are a set of waveforms called principal components, which are extracted from the data set. The coefficients of the principal components are uncorrelated with each other and can be used to quantify individual responses. The shapes of each of the first three principal components were very similar across neurons. 2. The coefficient of the first principal component was highly correlated with the spike count, but the other coefficients were not. Thus the coefficient of the first principal component reflects the strength of the response, whereas the coefficients of the other principal components reflect aspects of the temporal distribution of spikes in the response that are uncorrelated with the strength of the response. Statistical analysis revealed that the coefficients of up to 10 principal components were driven by the stimuli. Therefore stimuli govern the temporal distribution as well as the number of spikes in the response. 3. Through the application of information theory, we were able to compare the amount of stimulus-related information carried by LGN neurons when two codes were assumed: first, a univariate code based on response strength alone; and second, a multivariate temporal code based on the coefficients of the first three principal components. We found that LGN neurons were able to transmit an average of 1.5 times as much information using the three-component temporal code as they could using the strength code. 4. The stimulus set we used allowed us to calculate the amount of information each neuron could transmit about stimulus luminance, pattern, and contrast. All neurons transmitted the greatest amount of information about stimulus luminance, but they also transmitted significant amounts of information about stimulus pattern. This pattern information was not a reflection of the luminance or contrast of the pixel centered on the receptive field. 5. In addition to measuring the average amount of information each neuron transmitted about all stimuli, we also measured the amount of information each neuron transmitted about the individual stimuli with both the univariate spike count code and the multivariate temporal code. We then compared the amount of information transmitted per stimulus with the magnitudes of the responses to the individual stimuli. We found that the magnitudes of both the univariate and the multivariate responses to individual stimuli were poorly correlated with the information transmitted about the individual stimuli.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Cooling the striate cortex produced both facilitation and inhibition of the responses of all neurons, depending on the stimulus presented. Cooling the striate cortex also altered the temporal distribution of spikes in the responses of PLGN neurons. Shannon’s information measure revealed that cooling the striate cortex reduced the average stimulus-related information transmitted by all PLGN neurons. The reduction in transmitted information was associated with both facilitation and inhibition of the response. Cooling the striate cortex reduced the amount of information transmitted about all of the stimulus parameters tested: pattern, luminance, spatial contrast, and sequential contrast. The effect of cooling was nearly the same for codes based on the number of spikes in the response as for codes based on their temporal distribution. The reduction in transmitted information occurred because the differences among the responses to different stimuli (signal separation) were reduced, not because the variability of the responses to individual stimuli (noise) was increased. We conclude that one function of corticogeniculate feedback is to improve the ability of PLGN neurons to discriminate among stimuli by enhancing the differences among their responses.},

Using behaving monkeys, we studied the visual responses of single neurons in the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to a set of two-dimensional black and white patterns. We found that monkeys could be trained to make sufficiently reliable and stable fixations to enable us to plot and characterize the receptive fields of individual neurons. A qualitative examination of rasters and a statistical analysis of the data revealed that the responses of neurons were related to the stimuli. 2. The data from 5 of the 13 “X-like” neurons in our sample indicated the presence of antagonistic center and surround mechanisms and linear summation of luminance within center and surround mechanisms. We attribute the lack of evidence for surround antagonism in the eight neurons that failed to exhibit center-surround antagonism either to a mismatch between the size of the pixels in the stimuli and the size of the receptive field or to the lack of a surround mechanism (i.e., the type II neurons of Wiesel and Hubel). 3. The data from five other neurons confirm and extend previous reports indicating that the surround regions of X-like neurons can have nonlinearities. The responses of these neurons were not modulated when a contrast-reversing, bipartite stimulus was centered on the receptive field, which suggests a linear summation within the center and surround mechanisms. However, it was frequently the case for these neurons that stimuli of identical pattern but opposite contrast elicited responses of similar polarity, which indicates nonlinear behavior. 4. We found a wide variety of temporal patterns in the responses of individual LGN neurons, which included differences in the magnitude, width, and number of peaks of the initial on-transient and in the magnitude of the later sustained component. These different temporal patterns were repeatable and clearly different for different visual patterns. These results suggest that visual information may be carried in the shape as well as in the amplitude of the response waveform.},

The time- and voltage-dependent properties of a slowly inactivating and depolarization-activated potassium current and the functional consequences of its activation was investigated with current and single-electrode voltage-clamp techniques applied to guinea pig dorsal lateral geniculate neurons maintained as a slice in vitro. 2. In current clamp, application of a step depolarization to near firing threshold resulted in a slowly rising membrane potential that took up to 10 s to reach steady state and firing threshold. In voltage clamp, step depolarization of the membrane potential to values positive to approximately -65 mV resulted in the rapid activation followed by slow inactivation of an outward current. In both cases the sudden depolarization was associated with a large increase in membrane conductance, which gradually lessened in parallel with the slow depolarization in current clamp or with the decrease in outward current in voltage clamp. 3. The time course of inactivation of the outward current, which we refer to as IAs, was well fitted by a two-exponential function with time constants of 96 and 2,255 ms, suggesting the presence of a fast and slow phase of inactivation. The activation threshold for IAs was about -65 to -60 mV, whereas inactivation was incomplete even at -50 mV, suggesting the presence of a substantial “window” current. The time course of removal of inactivation of IAs at -85 to -100 mV was well fitted by a single exponential function with time constant of 91 ms. 4. IAs appears to be mediated by K+. Increasing [K+]o from 2.5 to 10 mM resulted in a reduction in amplitude of IAs, whereas changing from 10 to 2.5 mM [K+]o enhanced this current. Intracellular injection of Cs+ resulted in an abolition of IAs, whereas extracellular application of Ba2+ resulted in a large decrease in the apparent input conductance but relatively little reduction of IAs. 5. Both phases of inactivation of the transient outward current were completely blocked by low doses (100 microM) of 4-aminopyridine (4-AP), but not by extracellular application of Cs+, tetraethylammonium (TEA), tetrodotoxin (TTX), or after block of transmembrane Ca2+ currents. Local application of 4-AP to neurons depolarized to near firing threshold resulted in depolarization associated with a decrease in apparent input conductance, thereby confirming the presence of a window current.4+ this bias against depolarizing inputs.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {1. The physiological and functional features of time-dependent anomalous rectification activated by hyperpolarization and the current which underlies it, Ih, were examined in guinea-pig and cat thalamocortical relay neurones using in vitro intracellular recording techniques in thalamic slices. 2. Hyperpolarization of the membrane from rest with a constant-current pulse resulted in time-dependent rectification, expressed as a depolarizing sag of the membrane potential back towards rest. Under voltage clamp conditions, hyperpolarizing steps to membrane potentials negative to approximately -60 mV were associated with the activation of a slow inward current, Ih, which showed no inactivation with time. 3. The activation curve of the conductance underlying Ih was obtained through analysis of tail currents and ranged from -60 to -90 mV, with half-activation occurring at -75 mV. The time course of activation of Ih was well fitted by a single-exponential function and was strongly voltage dependent, with time constants ranging from greater than 1-2 s at threshold to an average of 229 ms at -95 mV. The time course of de-activation was also described by a single-exponential function, was voltage dependent, and the time constant ranged from an average of 1000 ms at -80 mV to 347 ms at -55 mV. 4. Raising [K+]o from 2.5 to 7.5 mM enhanced, while decreasing [Na+]o from 153 to 26 mM reduced, the amplitude of Ih. In addition, reduction of [Na+]o slowed the rate of Ih activation. These results indicate that Ih is carried by both Na+ and K+ ions, which is consistent with the extrapolated reversal potential of -43 mV. Replacement of Cl- in the bathing medium with isethionate shifted the chloride equilibrium potential positive by approximately 30-70 mV, evoked an inward shift of the holding current at -50 mV, and resulted in a marked reduction of instantaneous currents as well as Ih, suggesting a non-specific blocking action of impermeable anions. 5. Local (2-10 mM in micropipette) or bath (1-2 mM) applications of Cs+ abolished Ih over the whole voltage range tested (-60 to -110 mV), with no consistent effects on instantaneous currents. Barium (1 mM, local; 0.3-0.5 mM, bath) evoked a steady inward current, reduced the amplitude of instantaneous currents, and had only weak suppressive effects on Ih. 6. Block of Ih with local application of Cs+ resulted in a hyperpolarization of the membrane from the resting level, a decrease in apparent membrane conductance, and a block of the slow after-hyperpolarization that appears upon termination of depolarizing membrane responses, indicating that Ih contributes substantially to the resting and active membrane properties of thalamocortical relay neurones.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Much less is known about the mechanism of direct cholinergic inhibition in the central nervous system or its role in regulating neuronal activities. Here we report that application of ACh to thalamic nucleus reticularis (nRt) neurones, which are known to receive a cholinergic input from the ascending reticular system of the brain stem, causes a hyperpolarization due to a relatively small (1-4 nS) increase in membrane conductance to K+. This cholinergic action appears to be mediated by the M2 subclass of muscarinic receptors and acts in conjunction with the intrinsic membrane properties of nucleus reticularis neurones to inhibit single spike activity while promoting the occurrence of burst discharges. Thus, cholinergic inhibitory mechanisms may be important in controlling the firing pattern of this important group of thalamic neurones.},

abstract = {The mammalian thalamus forms an obligatory relay for nearly all sensory information that reaches the cerebral cortex. The transmission of sensory information by the thalamus varies in a state-dependent manner, such that during slow wave sleep or drowsiness thalamic responsiveness is markedly reduced, whereas during the waking, attentive state transmission is enhanced. Although activation of brainstem inputs to thalamic neurons has long been assumed to underlie this gating of sensory transfer through the thalamus, numerically the largest input to thalamic relay neurons derives from layer VI cells of the cerebral cortex. Here we report that activation of corticothalamic fibers causes a prolonged excitatory postsynaptic potential in guinea pig dorsal lateral geniculate relay neurons resulting from the reduction of a potassium conductance, consistent with the activation of glutamatergic “metabotropic” receptors. This slow depolarization can switch firing of thalamic neurons from the burst firing mode, which is prevalent during slow wave sleep, to the single spike mode, which is prevalent during waking, thereby facilitating transmission of sensory information through the thalamus. This prolonged enhancement of thalamic transfer may allow the cerebral cortex to gate or control selective fields of sensory inputs in a manner that facilitates arousal, attention, and cognition.},

Electrophysiological properties of neurons were assessed with intracellular recording techniques. Some neurons were identified morphologically by intracellular injection of the fluorescent dye Lucifer yellow CH. Three distinct neuronal classes of electrophysiological behavior were observed; these were termed regular spiking, bursting, and fast spiking. The physiological properties of neurons from sensorimotor and anterior cingulate areas did not differ significantly. Regular-spiking cells were characterized by action potentials with a mean duration of 0.80 ms at one-half amplitude, a ratio of maximum rate of spike rise to maximum rate of fall of 4.12, and a prominent afterhyperpolarization following a train of spikes. The primary slope of initial spike frequency versus injected current intensity was 241 Hz/nA. During prolonged suprathreshold current pulses the frequency of firing adapted strongly. When local synaptic pathways were activated, all cells were transiently excited and then strongly inhibited. Bursting cells were distinguished by their ability to generate endogenous, all-or-none bursts of three to five action potentials. Their properties were otherwise very similar to regular-spiking cells. The ability to generate a burst was eliminated when the membrane was depolarized to near the firing threshold with tonic current. By contrast, hyperpolarization of regular-spiking (i.e., nonbursting) cells did not uncover latent bursting tendencies. The action potentials of fast-spiking cells were much briefer (mean of 0.32 ms) than those of the other cell types.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)},

Some arise from distinct objects and should be segregated, and some are due to occlusion and should be discounted because they are spurious. Humans have little difficulty ignoring spurious motions at occlusions and correctly integrating object motion, and are evidently making use of form information to do so. There is a large body of theoretical and empirical evidence supporting the importance of form processes involving junctions in the way motion is integrated. To assess the role of more complex form analysis, we manipulated nonlocal form cues that could be varied independently of local junctions. Using variants on diamond and plaid stimuli used in previous studies, we found that manipulations distant from the junctions themselves could cause large changes in motion interpretation. Nonlocal information often overrides the integration decisions that would be expected from local cues.

As a result, studies of primary visual cortex (V1) have been performed almost entirely on neurons outside the high-resolution central portion of the visual field (the fovea). Here we describe a procedure for inferring eye position using multi-electrode array recordings from V1 coupled with nonlinear stimulus processing models. We show that this method can be used to infer eye position with 1 arc-min accuracy--significantly better than conventional techniques. This allows for analysis of foveal stimulus processing, and provides a means to correct for eye movement-induced biases present even outside the fovea. This method could thus reveal critical insights into the role of eye movements in cortical coding, as well as their contribution to measures of cortical variability.},

Here we examine this question in primary visual cortex (V1) using receptive-field-based models, combined with an experimental design that leaves the retinal stimulus unaffected by saccades. This approach allows us to analyse V1 stimulus processing during saccades with unprecedented detail, revealing robust perisaccadic modulation. In particular, saccades produce biphasic firing rate changes that are composed of divisive gain suppression followed by an additive rate increase. Microsaccades produce similar, though smaller, modulations. We furthermore demonstrate that this modulation is likely inherited from the LGN, and is driven largely by extra-retinal signals. These results establish a foundation for integrating saccades into existing models of visual cortical stimulus processing, and highlight the importance of studying visual neuron function in the context of eye movements.},

abstract = {Until recently, it was widely believed that object position and object motion were represented independently in the visual cortex. However, several studies have shown that adaptation to motion produces substantial shifts in the perceived position of subsequently viewed stationary objects. Two stages of motion adaptation have been proposed: an initial stage at the level of V1 and a secondary stage thought to be located in V5/MT. Indeed, selective adaptation can be demonstrated at each of these levels of motion analysis. What remains unknown is which of these cortical sites are involved in modulating the positional representation of subsequently viewed objects. To answer this question directly, we disrupted cortical activity by using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) immediately after motion adaptation. When TMS was delivered to V5/MT after motion adaptation, the perceived offset of the test stimulus was greatly reduced. In marked contrast, TMS of V1 had no effect on the changes that normally occur in perceived position after motion adaptation. This result demonstrates that the anatomical locus at which motion and positional information interact is area V5/MT rather than V1/V2.},

The model proposes a functional interpretation for the two cortical visual streams, with the (occipito-temporal) ventral stream processing visual information for perceptual purposes, and the (occipito-parietal) dorsal stream providing visual guidance for movement. In the past two decades, the model has had a revolutionary effect within visual neuroscience, elevated the study of motor control to previously unthinkable prominence and inspired thousands of empirical studies. Moreover, its influence has reached beyond the boundaries of neuroscience, fuelling philosophical debates and even capturing the popular imagination (Goodale & Milner, 2004; Ramachandran & Blakeslee, 1998).

Here, we investigated whether this behavioral limit in object recognition reflects limitations in the temporal processing capacity of early visual areas tuned to basic features or high-level areas tuned to complex objects. We used functional MRI (fMRI) to measure the temporal processing capacity of multiple areas along the ventral visual pathway progressing from the primary visual cortex (V1) to high-level object-selective regions, specifically the fusiform face area (FFA) and parahippocampal place area (PPA). Subjects viewed successive images of faces or houses at presentation rates varying from 2.3-37.5 items/second while performing an object discrimination task. Measures of the temporal frequency response profile of each visual area revealed a systematic decline in peak tuning across the visual hierarchy. Areas V1-V3 showed peak activity at rapid presentation rates of 18-25 items/sec, area V4v peaked at intermediate rates (9 items/sec), and the FFA and PPA peaked at the slowest temporal rates (4-5 items/sec). Our results reveal a progressive loss in the temporal processing capacity of the human visual system as information is transferred from early visual areas to higher areas. These data suggest that temporal limitations in object recognition likely result from the limited processing capacity of high-level object-selective areas rather than that of earlier stages of visual processing.},

abstract = {Adaptation to static scenes is a familiar and fundamental aspect of visual perception that causes negative afterimages, fading, and many other visual illusions. To establish a foundation for understanding the neuronal bases of such phenomena and to constrain the contributions of retinal versus cortical processing, we studied the responses of neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus during and after the presentation of prolonged static visual stimuli. We found that parvocellular (P) cells (the more numerous and color-sensitive pathway) showed response adaptation with a time constant on the order of tens of seconds and that their response after the removal of a visual stimulus lasting 1 min was similar in amplitude and time course to the response evoked by the photographic negative stimulus. Magnocellular (M) cells (the faster-conducting and achromatic pathway) had after responses that were substantially weaker than responses evoked by patterned visual stimuli. This difference points to the existence of an adaptive mechanism in the P-pathway that is absent or impaired in the M-pathway and is inconsistent with full adaptation of photoreceptors, which feed both pathways. Cells in both pathways often maintained a substantial tonic response throughout 1 min stimuli, suggesting that these major feedforward inputs to cortex adapt too slowly to account for visual fading. Our findings suggest that faster-adapting mechanisms in cortex are likely to be required to account for the dynamics of perception during and after the viewing of prolonged static images.},

For both mechanisms, attending to multiple object locations decreased processing efficiency at a single location, resulting in both decreased behavioral performance and decreased blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) signal attentional modulation. When the two mechanisms attended to multiple objects across the same spatial extent, the multiple spotlight mechanism, which ignores intervening stimuli, yielded better performance anhigher BOLD signal. When the two mechanisms processed the same number of stimuli, splitting the spotlight neither impaired performance nor diminished BOLD signal in occipital cortex. The surprising efficiency of the multiple spotlight mechanism supports the emerging view that spatial attention is easily deployed in a diverse range of spatial configurations.},

abstract = {The ablation of afferent input results in the reorganization of sensory and motor cortices. In the primary visual cortex (V1), binocular retinal lesions deprive a corresponding cortical region [lesion projection zone (LPZ)] of visual input. Nevertheless, neurons in the LPZ regain responsiveness by shifting their receptive fields (RFs) outside the retinal lesions; this re-emergence of neural activity is paralleled by the perceptual completion of disrupted visual input in human subjects with retinal damage. To determine whether V1 reorganization can account for perceptual fill-in, we developed a neural network model that simulates the cortical remapping in V1. The model shows that RF shifts mediated by the plexus of spatial- and orientation-dependent horizontal connections in V1 can engender filling-in that is both robust and consistent with psychophysical reports of perceptual completion. Our model suggests that V1 reorganization may underlie perceptual fill-in, and it predicts spatial relationships between the original and remapped RFs that can be tested experimentally. More generally, it provides a general explanation for adaptive functional changes following CNS lesions, based on the recruitment of existing cortical connections that are involved in normal integrative mechanisms.},

abstract = {In human subjects, two mechanisms for improving the efficiency of saccades in visual search have recently been described: color priming and concurrent processing of two saccades. Since the monkey provides an important model for understanding the neural underpinnings of target selection in visual search, we sought to explore the degree to which the saccadic system of monkeys uses these same mechanisms. Therefore, we recorded the eye movements of rhesus monkeys performing a simple color-oddity pop-out search task, similar to that used previously with human subjects. The monkeys were rewarded for making a saccade to the odd-colored target, which was presented with an array of three distractors. The target and distractors were randomly chosen to be red or green in each trial. Similar to what was previously observed for humans, we found that monkeys show the influence of a cumulative, short-term priming mechanism which facilitates saccades when the color of the search target happens to repeat from trial to trial. Furthermore, we found that like humans, when monkeys make an erroneous initial saccade to a distractor, they are capable of executing a second saccade to the target after a very brief inter-saccadic interval, suggesting that the two saccades have been programmed concurrently (i.e. in parallel). These results demonstrate a close similarity between human and monkey performance. We also made a new observation: we found that when monkeys make such two-saccade responses, the trajectory of the initial saccade tends to curve toward the goal of the subsequent saccade. This provides evidence that the two saccade goals are simultaneously represented on a common motor map, supporting the idea that the movements are processed concurrently. It also indicates that concurrent processing is not limited to brain areas involved in higher-level planning; rather, such parallel programming apparently occurs at a low enough level in the saccadic system that it can affect saccade trajectory.},

abstract = {The morphology of the human cortex varies remarkably across individuals, regardless of overall brain size. It is currently unclear whether related cortical regions covary in gray matter density, as a result of mutually trophic influences or common experience-related plasticity. We acquired a structural magnetic resonance imaging scan from 172 subjects and extracted the regional gray matter densities from 12 readily identifiable regions of interest involved in sensorimotor or higher-order cognitive functions. We then used these values to predict regional densities in the remaining areas of the cortex, using voxel-based morphometry. This revealed patterns of positive and negative covariance that provide insight into the topographical organization of multiple cortical regions. We report that the gray matter density of a region is a good predictor of the density of the homotopic region in the contralateral hemisphere, with the striking exception of primary visual cortex. Whereas some regions express patterns of regional covariance that are mirror symmetrical relative to the interhemispheric fissure, other regions express asymmetric patterns of regional covariance. Finally, patterns of covariance are remarkably consistent between males and females, with the exception of the left amygdala, which is positively associated with the left and right anterior inferior temporal cortex in males and with the right angular gyrus in females. Our study establishes that the density of different cortical regions is coordinated within an individual. The coordinated variations we report are likely to be determined by both genetic and environmental factors and may be the basis for differences in individual behavior.},

The original classification scheme was based on a number of partly subjective tests of linear spatial summation. Later, investigators adopted an objective classification method based on the ratio between the amplitude of the first harmonic of the response and the mean spike rate (or the F(1)/F(0) ratio) when the neuron is stimulated with drifting sinusoidal gratings. This measure is bimodally distributed over the population and divides neurons into two classes that correspond closely to the classical definition by Hubel and Wiesel. Here we show that a simple rectification model can predict the observed bimodal distribution of F(1)/F(0) in primary visual cortex when the distributions of the intracellular response modulation and mean are unimodal. Thus, contrary to common belief, the bimodality of F(1)/F(0) does not necessarily imply the existence of two discrete cell classes. Furthermore, in reviewing the literature, we find no independent support for a simple/complex dichotomy. These results suggest that the existence of two distinct neural populations in primary visual cortex, and the associated hierarchical model of receptive field organization, need to be re-evaluated.},

Psychophysical observations and models of early visual processing suggest that human visual feature detectors are specialized for edge-like and line-like phase congruence. To test whether primary visual cortex (V1) neurons account for such specificity, we made tetrode recordings in anesthetized macaque monkeys. Stimuli were drifting equal-energy compound gratings composed of four sinusoidal components. Eight congruence phases (one-dimensional features) were tested, including line-like and edge-like waveforms. Many of the 137 single V1 neurons (recorded at 45 sites) could reliably signal phase congruence by any of several response measures. Across neurons, the preferred spatial feature had only a modest bias for line-like waveforms. Information-theoretic analysis showed that congruence phase was temporally encoded in the frequency band present in the stimuli. The most sensitive neurons had feature discrimination thresholds that approached psychophysical levels, but typical neurons were substantially less sensitive. In single V1 neurons, feature discrimination exhibited various dependences on the congruence phase of the reference waveform. Simple cells were over-represented among the most sensitive neurons and on average carried twice as much feature information as complex cells. However, the distribution of the indices of optimal tuning and discrimination of relative phase was indistinguishable in simple and complex cells. Our results suggest that phase-sensitive pooling of responses is required to account for human psychophysical performance, although variation in feature selectivity among nearby neurons is considerable.},

Because these compound grating stimuli were drifting, allowing for potential interaction between shape and motion, we examine here the dependence of V1 feature tuning on drift speed. We find that the feature selectivity and specificity of individual V1 neurons strongly depend on speed. A simple model explains these observations in terms of an interaction between linear filtering by the receptive field and the static nonlinearity of spike threshold, embedded in a recurrent network. While the speed-dependent behaviors in single V1 neurons preclude their acting as extractors of one-dimensional features, the population as a whole retains a representation of a full suite of features.},

This transfer of adaptation also influenced the perception of test stimuli shown at an intermediate position between fixation and saccadic target. Additionally, I found a presaccadic transfer of adaptation when observers prepared to move their eyes toward a stationary adapting stimulus in peripheral vision.

The time course of the response to the visual stimulus at the paired RF location is altered, with an enhancement of the response preceding the spike time and a reduction following the spike. Such bidirectional modification is consistent with spike timing-dependent plasticity. Response modification also occurs at nearby locations, the direction and magnitude of which are correlated with the change at the paired location. In addition, changes at unpaired locations show a negative correlation with the initial strength of the response, which may facilitate rapid modification of the spatial RF profile.},

Oscillatory synchrony has been proposed as a mechanism for rapid and reliable communication of signals, subserving cognitive functions such as attention and object identification. We propose that saccade-related corollary activity has a crucial role in anticipatory preparation of visual centers, which interacts with ongoing oscillation, favoring the processing of postfixational signals. During prolonged fixations, microsaccades could be generated to exploit this mechanism. Studying this interplay between the sensory and the motor system will provide novel insight into the dynamics of natural vision.},

We found that neural filling-in effects occurred automatically in areas V1 and V2, regardless of where the subject attended. Moreover, when phantom-inducing gratings were paired with competing stimuli in a binocular rivalry display, subjects reported spontaneous fluctuations in conscious perception of the phantom accompanied by tightly coupled changes in early visual activity. Our results indicate that phantom visual experiences are closely linked to automatic filling-in of activity at the earliest stages of cortical processing.},

abstract = {Humans possess an ability to perceive and synchronize movements to the beat in music (’beat perception and synchronization’), and recent neuroscientific data have offered new insights into this beat-finding capacity at multiple neural levels. Here, we review and compare behavioural and neural data on temporal and sequential processing during beat perception and entrainment tasks in macaques (including direct neural recording and local field potential (LFP)) and humans (including fMRI, EEG and MEG). These abilities rest upon a distributed set of circuits that include the motor cortico-basal-ganglia-thalamo-cortical (mCBGT) circuit, where the supplementary motor cortex (SMA) and the putamen are critical cortical and subcortical nodes, respectively. In addition, a cortical loop between motor and auditory areas, connected through delta and beta oscillatory activity, is deeply involved in these behaviours, with motor regions providing the predictive timing needed for the perception of, and entrainment to, musical rhythms. The neural discharge rate and the LFP oscillatory activity in the gamma- and beta-bands in the putamen and SMA of monkeys are tuned to the duration of intervals produced during a beat synchronization-continuation task (SCT). Hence, the tempo during beat synchronization is represented by different interval-tuned cells that are activated depending on the produced interval. In addition, cells in these areas are tuned to the serial-order elements of the SCT. Thus, the underpinnings of beat synchronization are intrinsically linked to the dynamics of cell populations tuned for duration and serial order throughout the mCBGT. We suggest that a cross-species comparison of behaviours and the neural circuits supporting them sets the stage for a new generation of neurally grounded computational models for beat perception and synchronization.},

Different analytical techniques were used to determine the existence of a central or distributed timing mechanism across tasks. The results showed a linear increase in performance variability as a function of the interval duration in all tasks. However, this compliance of the scalar property of interval timing was accompanied by a strong effect of S, N, and M and the interaction between these variables on the subjects’ temporal accuracy. Thus the performance variability was larger not only in perceptual tasks than that in motor-timing tasks, but also using visual rather than auditory stimuli, and decreased as a function of the number of intervals. These results suggest the existence of a partially overlapping distributed mechanism underlying the ability to quantify time in different contexts.},

Analyses of activity patterns in ITC and PFC revealed that both areas contain “abstract” category information (i.e., category information that is not directly correlated with properties of the stimuli); however, in general, PFC has more task-relevant information, and ITC has more detailed visual information. Analyses examining how information coded in these areas show that almost all category information is available in a small fraction of the neurons in the population. Most remarkably, our results also show that category information is coded by a nonstationary pattern of activity that changes over the course of a trial with individual neurons containing information on much shorter time scales than the population as a whole.},

We show that influences along feedforward projections predominate in the gamma band, whereas influences along feedback projections predominate in the alpha-beta band. Rhythmic inter-areal influences constrain a functional hierarchy of the seven homologous human visual areas that is in close agreement with the respective macaque anatomical hierarchy. Rhythmic influences allow an extension of the hierarchy to 26 human visual areas including uniquely human brain areas. Hierarchical levels of ventral- and dorsal-stream visual areas are differentially affected by inter-areal influences in the alpha-beta band.},

abstract = {A series of simultaneous recordings from several striate cortex neurons were made in paralyzed, anesthetized cats. Recordings were obtained with one or two bundles of extra fine wires and originated from one and two cortical orientation columns. Standard PST histograms and, in some cases, response planes were used to analyse the neuronal receptive fields. Functional connectivity between neurons was assessed by cross-correlation of their spike trains. It was found that 61% of neuronal pairs found within a column shared the same input, either excitatory or inhibitory, Even if neurons in a pair belonged to two different columns separated by 1mm lateral distance, 40% of pairs still exhibited shared input coordination. This type of coordination could also encompass all combinations of simple and complex fields in the pair. Direct connections between neurons were found almost exclusively within columns: excitatory connections were found in 20% of cases and inhibitory in 8%. Direct connections were often accompanied by the other types of interactions. Only one example of excitatory and one of inhibitory direct connections were found between columns. In both cases preferred orientations were almost identical.},

To study this issue, three statistical decoders were used to extract the information in the responses of model neurons about the binocular disparities present in simulated pairs of left-eye and right-eye images: (1) the full joint probability decoder considered all possible statistical relations among neural responses as potentially important; (2) the dependence tree decoder also considered all possible relations as potentially important, but it approximated high-order statistical correlations using a computationally tractable procedure; and (3) the independent response decoder, which assumed that neural responses are statistically independent, meaning that all correlations should be zero and thus can be ignored. Simulation results indicate that high-order correlations among model neuron responses contain significant information about binocular disparities and that the amount of this high-order information increases rapidly as a function of neural population size. Furthermore, the results highlight the potential importance of the dependence tree decoder to neuroscientists as a powerful but still practical way of approximating high-order correlations among neural responses.},

One class of stimuli that are common to visual and auditory systems and, as we show, the electrosensory system are signals that contain power in a narrow range of temporal (or spatial) frequencies. Characteristic of this class of signals is a slower variation in their amplitude, otherwise known as an envelope. There is eidence suggesting that, in the visual cortex, both narrowband stimuli and their envelopes are coded for in separate and parallel streams. The implementation of this parallel transmission is not well understood at the cellular level. We have identified the cellular basis for the parallel transmission of signal and envelope in the electrosensory system: a two-cell network consisting of an interneuron connected to a pyramidal cell by means of a slow synapse. This circuit could, in principle, be implemented in the auditory or visual cortex by the previously identified biophysics of cortical interneurons.},

abstract = {Although the mechanisms by which the cerebral cortex controls its ascending input are still poorly understood, it is known that cortical control at the thalamic level is via direct glutamatergic projections to relay nuclei and to the reticular nucleus. Here we confirm previous light microscopic reports of a high expression of the α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptor subunit, GluR4, in reticular and ventral posterior thalamic nuclei of the rat, and moderate staining using an antibody recognizing both GluR2 and GluR3. In contrast only low levels of staining for GluR2, and barely detectable levels of GluR1 immunoreactivity were observed. After injections of biotinylated dextran, electron microscopy revealed that anterogradely-labeled cortical synapses in both thalamic nuclei were small with fewer mitochondria and more densely-packed vesicles than terminals likely to arise from intrinsic and ascending pathways. We performed post-embedding immunogold to provide quantitative data on the density of AMPA receptor subunits at morphologically-defined groups of synapses. We found that corticothalamic synapses in the reticular thalamic nucleus contain twice as much GluR2/3, and at least three times more GluR4 protein than do intrathalamic synapses. In the ventral posterior nucleus, corticothalamic synapses contain similar amounts of GluR2/3, but four times more GluR4 than do those from ascending afferents. Corticothalamic synapses in reticular nucleus contain slightly more GluR2/3, and three times more GluR4, than those in ventral posterior nucleus. We conclude that enrichment of GluR4 at morphologically-defined cortical synapses is a feature common to both thalamic nuclei, and those in the reticular nucleus express higher levels of AMPA receptors. The rapid kinetics of GluR4-rich AMPA receptors we suggest indicate that cortical descending control may be more temporally precise than previously recognized.},

abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

We searched for motifs in spontaneous activity, recorded from the rat barrel cortex and from the cat striate cortex of anesthetized animals, and found numerous repeating patterns of high similarity and repetition rates. To test their significance, various statistics were compared between physiological data and three different types of stochastic surrogate data that preserve dynamical characteristics of the recorded data. We found no evidence for the existence of deterministically generated cortical motifs. Rather, the stochastic properties of cortical motifs suggest that they appear by chance, as a result of the constraints imposed by the coarse dynamics of subthreshold ongoing activity.},

In the visual system, repetitive presentation of a stimulus results in the reduction of power elicited in the gamma frequency band. However, this reduction does not result in degradation of perception; on the contrary, perception is improved by prior experience with the stimulus. To explain how reduction of gamma frequency oscillations, observed in priming experiments, can lead to improvement in behavior, we assume that visual processing takes place in two distinct stages: representation sharpening in the early visual areas and competitive interaction among representations in the higher visual areas and the prefrontal cortex. Here, we present a network model of spiking neurons that demonstrates how stimulus repetition leads to a decrease in power of the local field potential oscillations in the gamma frequency range in the early layer and also improves network response by reducing the latency to reach a decision in the higher area.},

In a Hodgkin-Huxley-based spiking neural network model of visual cortex, we show that modulation of feedback inputs to V1 from higher cortical areas results in shunting inhibition in V1 neurons, which changes the response properties of V1 neurons. The orientation selectivity of V1 neurons is enhanced without changing orientation preference, preserving the topographic organizations in V1. These results provide new insights to the mechanisms of plasticity in the adult brain, reconciling apparently inconsistent experiments and providing a new hypothesis for a functional role of the feedback connections.},

abstract = {The four perceptually simple colors ‚Äî red, green, yellow and blue ‚Äî are a challenge to neuroscience, because no one has found cortical cells that represent color in terms of these ‚Äòunique hues‚Äô [1]. The chromatically selective cells at early stages of the primate visual system do not map on to the unique hues [2] and [3]. Recently, however, Stoughton and Conway [4] have reported that the peak sensitivities of color cells in posterior inferior temporal cortex do cluster near the unique hues. The authors plot their results as a polar histogram: at each position on a hue circle, they show the number of cells that are maximally excited by that hue. There are three peaks in the histogram: one (the largest) falls close to unique red and another falls close to unique blue, while the third (less well-defined) lies in the yellow-green region. In fact, however, if the stimuli used in the experiment are plotted in a physiological color space, they form not a circle but an obtuse triangle. The peaks identified by Stoughton and Conway [4] fall at the apices of this triangle. Because these stimuli maximize the ratios of cone signals, they would maximally excite cells earlier in the visual system. So Stoughton and Conway’s polar plot does not in itself show that cells of the posterior inferior temporal cortex represent unique hues, nor that they differ qualitatively in their behavior from chromatic cells at an earlier level.},

We correlated activity recorded in the FEF of monkeys manually reporting the identity of a visual search target to performance accuracy and reaction time. Monkeys were cued to the most probable target location with a cue array containing a popout color singleton. Neurons exhibited spatially selective responses for the popout cue stimulus and for the target of the search array. The magnitude of activity related to the location of the cue prior to the presentation of the search array was correlated with trends in behavioral performance across valid, invalid, and neutral cue trial conditions. However, the speed and accuracy of the behavioral report on individual trials were predicted by the magnitude of spatial selectivity related to the target to be identified, not for the spatial cue. A minimum level of selectivity was necessary for target detection and a higher level for target identification. Muscimol inactivation of FEF produced spatially selective perceptual deficits in the covert search task that were correlated with the effectiveness of the inactivation and were strongest on invalid cue trials that require an endogenous attention shift. These results demonstrate a strong functional link between FEF activity and covert spatial attention and suggest that spatial signals from FEF directly influence visual processing during the time that a stimulus to be identified is being processed by the visual system.},

abstract = {The spiking activity of nearby cortical neurons is not independent. Numerous studies have explored the importance of this correlated responsivity for visual coding and perception, often by comparing the information conveyed by pairs of simultaneously recorded neurons with the sum of information provided by the respective individual cells. Pairwise responses typically provide slightly more information so that encoding is weakly synergistic. The simple comparison between pairwise and summed individual responses conflates several forms of correlation, however, making it impossible to judge the relative importance of synchronous spiking, basic tuning properties, and stimulus-independent and stimulus-dependent correlation. We have applied an information theoretic approach to this question, using the responses of pairs of neurons to drifting sinusoidal gratings of different directions and contrasts that have been recorded in the primary visual cortex of anesthetized macaque monkeys. Our approach allows us to break down the information provided by pairs of neurons into a number of components. This analysis reveals that, although synchrony is prevalent and informative, the additional information it provides frequently is offset by the redundancy arising from the similar tuning properties of the two cells. Thus coding is approximately independent with weak synergy or redundancy arising, depending on the similarity in tuning and the temporal precision of the analysis. We suggest that this would allow cortical circuits to enjoy the stability provided by having similarly tuned neurons without suffering the penalty of redundancy, because the associated information transmission deficit is compensated for by stimulus-dependent synchrony.},

By using general simple models of population activity, we show that when considering one or two periodic stimulus features, a narrow tuning width provides better population encoding accuracy. When encoding more than two periodic stimulus features, the information conveyed by the population is instead maximal for finite values of the tuning width. These optimal values are only weakly dependent on model parameters and are similar to the width of tuning to orientation or motion direction of real visual cortical neurons. A very large tuning width leads to poor encoding accuracy, whatever the number of stimulus features encoded. Thus, optimal coding of periodic stimuli is different from that of nonperiodic stimuli, which, as shown in previous studies, would require infinitely large tuning widths when coding more than two stimulus features.},

We found that both the spike counts and the low-frequency LFP phase were reliably modulated by the movie and thus conveyed information about it. Moreover, movie periods eliciting higher firing rates also elicited a higher reliability of LFP phase across trials. To establish whether the LFP phase at which spikes were emitted conveyed visual information that could not be extracted by spike rates alone, we compared the Shannon information about the movie carried by spike counts to that carried by the phase of firing. We found that at low LFP frequencies, the phase of firing conveyed 54% additional information beyond that conveyed by spike counts. The extra information available in the phase of firing was crucial for the disambiguation between stimuli eliciting high spike rates of similar magnitude. Thus, phase coding may allow primary cortical neurons to represent several effective stimuli in an easily decodable format.},

abstract = {Rats discriminate texture by whisking their vibrissae across the surfaces of objects. This process induces corresponding vibrissa vibrations, which must be accurately represented by neurons in the somatosensory pathway. In this study, we investigated the neural code for vibrissa motion in the ventroposterior medial (VPm) nucleus of the thalamus by single-unit recording. We found that neurons conveyed a great deal of information (up to 77.9 bits/s) about vibrissa dynamics. The key was precise spike timing, which typically varied by less than a millisecond from trial to trial. The neural code was sparse, the average spike being remarkably informative (5.8 bits/spike). This implies that as few as four VPm spikes, coding independent information, might reliably differentiate between 106 textures. To probe the mechanism of information transmission, we compared the role of time-varying firing rate to that of temporally correlated spike patterns in two ways: 93.9% of the information encoded by a neuron could be accounted for by a hypothetical neuron with the same time-dependent firing rate but no correlations between spikes; moreover, 93.4% of the information in the spike trains could be decoded even if temporal correlations were ignored. Taken together, these results suggest that the essence of the VPm code for vibrissa motion is firing rate modulation on a submillisecond timescale. The significance of such a code may be that it enables a small number of neurons, firing only few spikes, to convey distinctions between very many different textures to the barrel cortex.},

abstract = {Postembedding immunocytochemistry with a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) antiserum was done on semithin sections of cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) previously processed with the rapid-Golgi and gold-toning procedures, to determine which of the three main morphological types (1, 2,3) of neurons in the A-laminae show immunoreactivity and are, therefore, presumably GABAergic. Only type 3 cells were found to be GABA positive. These cells were characterized by small somata and few, scarcely branched dendrites bearing almost exclusively appendages with long slender stalks. Some of these cells have extensive filiform “axonlike” processes originating from different regions of dendrites and having appendages similar to those originating directly from dendrites. Many of these Golgi gold-toned impregnated dendritic appendages of type 3 cells were analyzed in the electron microscope and were identified as typical F2 terminals by their content of pleomorphic synaptic vesicles; by being postsynaptic to retinal (RLP), cortical (RSD), and perigeniculate (F1) terminals; and by being presynaptic to dendrites. In addition, since it was previously demonstrated that glutamic acid decarboxylase (GAD) and GABA-positive cells are not retrogradely labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRP) from the visual cortex, the present results, by showing that GABA-positive cells have type 3 morphology, provide supporting evidence for the interneuronal nature of type 3 cells in cat LGN.},

abstract = {Synaptic terminals from the axons of type 3 neurons in the A-laminae of the cat LGN impregnated with the Golgi gold-toning procedure were examined at light and electron microscopic levels. The axons were identified by their somatic origin, thin diameter, and, in one of these cells, by dense undercoating beneath the axolemma, which is a known characteristic of the axon initial segment. The axon of one of the analyzed cells was profusely branched and extended throughout most of lamina A within the dendritic domains of the cell, and both types of processes were oriented along projection lines in LGN. This suggests that the dendrites and axons of type 3 cells receive inputs and exert effects, of probably inhibitory nature, within restricted retinotopic regions of LGN. The vast majority of the axon terminals of these cells were distributed in series along axonal branches. In one of the type 3 cells, however, a dense cluster of terminals arising from a secondary axonal branch was observed. Ultrastructurally, the analyzed synaptic terminals of the type 3 cells contained flattened or pleomorphic synaptic vesicles, dark mitochondria, and established synapses that appeared to be of symmetrical type when the membranes were perpendicularly cut. On the basis of these characteristics these terminals are classified as F boutons, following Guillery’s (Z. Zellforsch. 96:1-38, ‘69), nomenclature. The postsynaptic elements to the axon terminals were dendrites of small to medium size, which received “en passant” synaptic contacts in extraglomerular regions of the geniculate neuropil by the terminals distributed in series. The axon terminals located in clusters, however, made synapses with dendrites in glomerular regions of the neuropil, where they were not seen postsynaptic to retinal or other types of terminals. This is in contrast to the postsynaptic nature of F2 boutons in the same glomeruli, which have been identified as dendritic appendages of the GABA positive type 3 neurons in the cat LGN (Montero: J. Comp. Neurol. 254:228-245, ‘86). On the other hand, the axonal F terminals differ from F1 boutons in terms of synaptic relations and ultrastructure, since the latter have been shown to be presynaptic to F2s and somata and to contain crowded populations of flat synaptic vesicles which give them a characteristic dark appearance. Terminals equivalent to F1 boutons have been shown to originate from perigeniculate cells in the rat LGN. From these observations it is suggested that the geniculate GABAergic interneurons support two morphologically and functionally different type of inhibitory terminals synapsing the dendrites of relay cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

This coarse-to-fine temporal stream was initially considered to be a cortical function, but has recently been demonstrated in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. The goal of this study was to test the hypothesis that coarse-to-fine processing is present at earlier stages of visual processing in the retinal ganglion cells that supply lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons. To compare coarse-to-fine processing in the cat’s visual system, we measured the visual responses of connected neuronal pairs from the retina and LGN, and separate populations of cells from each region. We found that coarse-to-fine processing was clearly present at the ganglion cell layer of the retina. Interestingly, peak and high-spatial-frequency cutoff responses were higher in the LGN than in the retina, indicating that there was a progressive cascade of coarse-to-fine information from the retina to the LGN to the visual cortex. The analysis of early visual pathway receptive field characteristics showed that the physiological response interplay between the center and surround regions was consistent with coarse-to-fine features and may provide a primary role in the underlying mechanism. Taken together, the results from this study provided a framework for understanding the emergence and refinement of coarse-to-fine processing in the visual system.},

This raises the question of how these stimulus properties interact to shape neuronal responses. While past studies have shown that the bandwidth of orientation tuning is invariant to stimulus contrast, the influence of temporal frequency on orientation-tuning bandwidth is unknown. Here, we investigate the influence of temporal frequency on orientation tuning and direction selectivity in area 17 of ferret visual cortex. For both simple cells and complex cells, measures of orientation-tuning bandwidth (half-width at half-maximum response) are approximately 20-25 degrees across a wide range of temporal frequencies. Thus cortical neurons display temporal-frequency invariant orientation tuning. In contrast, direction selectivity is typically reduced, and occasionally reverses, at nonpreferred temporal frequencies. These results show that the mechanisms contributing to the generation of orientation tuning and direction selectivity are differentially affected by the temporal frequency of a visual stimulus and support the notion that stability of orientation tuning is an important aspect of visual processing.},

Combined blood flow and oxygenation measurements provide the best tool for investigating modulations of oxidative metabolism. We measured the human V1 response to a peripheral low contrast stimulus using fMRI and found a larger fractional modulation of blood flow with attention compared to the blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) response, thus indicating a much larger modulation of oxygen metabolism than was previously thought. These findings point to different aspects of neural activity driving flow and metabolic changes to different degrees. We propose that V1 flow is driven strongly but not exclusively by the initial sensory-driven neural activity, which dominates the response in the unattended condition, while V1 oxygen metabolism is driven strongly by the overall neural activity, which is modulated by top-down signals related to attention.},

This non-sensory-evoked activity was localized and corresponded to the perceived location of the change. When a change was missed, or when observers attended to a different task, the change failed to evoke such a response. The latency of the nonsensory component increased linearly with subjects’ reaction time, with a slope of one, and its amplitude was independent of contrast.

abstract = {The spatial organization of neuronal elements and their connectivity make up the substrate underlying the information processing carried out in the networks they form. Conventionally, anatomical findings make the initial structure which later combines with superimposed neurophysiological information to create a functional organization map. The most common neurophysiological measure is the single neuron spike train extracted from an extracellular recording. This single neuron firing pattern provides valuable clues on information processing in a given brain area; however, it only gives a sparse and focal view of this process. Even with the increase in number of simultaneously recorded neurons, inference on their large-scale functional organization remains problematic. We propose a method of utilizing additional information derived from the same extracellular recording to generate a more comprehensive picture of neuronal functional organization. This analysis is based on the relationship between the oscillatory activity of single neurons and their neighboring neuronal populations. Two signals that reflect the multiple scales of neuronal populations are used to complement the single neuron spike train: (1) the high-frequency background unit activity representing the spiking activity of small localized sub-populations and (2) the low-frequency local field potential that represents the synaptic input to a larger global population. The three coherences calculated between pairs of these three signals arising from a single source of extracellular recording are then used to infer mosaic representations of the functional neuronal organization. We demonstrate this methodology on experimental data and on simulated leaky integrate-and-fire neurons.},

abstract = {The veridical perception of collinearity between two separated lines is distorted by two parallel lines in the space between them (the Poggendorff illusion). This paper tests the conjecture that the perception of collinearity of separated lines is based on a two-stage mechanism. The first stage encodes the orientation of the virtual line between the proximal terminators of the target lines. The second stage compares this virtual orientation with the orientation of the target lines themselves. Errors can and do arise from either process. Two parallel lines, abutting against the target lines, cause the classical Poggendorff misalignment bias. The magnitude of the bias is increased by Gaussian blur, as is a version of the Poggendorff figure containing only acute angles. In the obtuse-angle figure, on the other hand, blur decreases the misalignment bias. We argue that the acute- and obtuse-angle biases depend upon different mechanisms, and that the obtuse-angle effect is more related to the obtuse-angle version of the Muller-Lyer illusion, which is also decreased by blur. If observers attempt to match the orientation of the virtual line between the two line intersections in the Poggendorff figure they make an error in the same direction as the Poggendorff bias. The orientation of the target lines in the figure, however, is veridically matched to a Gabor-patch probe, unless the target lines are very short, in which case the error is in the same direction as the Poggendorff bias. A small bend in the target lines where they abut the parallels increases the Poggendorff bias if it makes the line more orthogonal to the parallel, but has little effect in the opposite direction. The Poggendorff bias is unlikely to depend upon biases in first-stage linear filters because (a) it still exists in figures composed of short, luminance-balanced lines which are defined by contrast only; and (b) it also exists if the parallels are replaced by grating patches with the same mean luminance as the background. The orientation of the grating in the latter case affects the magnitude of the bias, but even an orientation which should reverse the Poggendorff bias by the mechanism of cross-orientation inhibition fails to do so. The Poggendorff bias is a complex effect arising from several sources. Blurring in second-stage filters with large receptive fields can explain many aspects of the phenomenon Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

When the patches were large relative to the image size, the appearance of the reconstructed image was similar to that of the image from which the phase information had been derived, in agreement with previous reports of phase-dominance in the global Fourier Transform. However, when the patch size was made sufficiently small, the appearance of reconstructed images was dominated by amplitude rather than phase. This was not simply due to the DC component of the amplitude spectrum. Prior low-pass filtering of the images enhanced the dominance of amplitude information in the patchwise transform. We conclude that patchwise-reconstructed images contain two quite distinct kinds of information for the human observer. The first is the positional information (“local sign”) of the patches themselves; the second is the textural information within patches, which is dominated by amplitude rather than phase. The reason why the global Fourier Transform is dominated by phase is that in the absence of any other information about local sign, phase is necessary to reconstruct localised features such as edges.},

It remains unknown, however, whether cortical EPS (also known as “gain fields”) have the necessary spatial and temporal characteristics to fulfill their purported computational roles. To quantify these EPS, we combined single-unit recordings in four dorsal visual areas of behaving rhesus macaques (lateral intraparietal area, ventral intraparietal area, middle temporal area, and the medial superior temporal area) with likelihood-based population-decoding techniques. The decoders used knowledge of spiking statistics to estimate eye position during fixation from a set of observed spike counts across neurons. Importantly, these samples were short in duration (100 ms) and from individual trials to mimic the real-time estimation problem faced by the brain. The results suggest that cortical EPS provide an accurate and precise representation of eye position, albeit with unequal signal fidelity across brain areas and a modest underestimation of eye eccentricity. The underestimation of eye eccentricity predicted a pattern of mislocalization that matches the errors made by human observers. In addition, we found that eccentric eye positions were associated with enhanced precision relative to the primary eye position. This predicts that positions in visual space should be represented more reliably during eccentric gaze than while looking straight ahead. Together, these results suggest that cortical eye-position signals provide a useable head-centered representation of visual space on timescales that are compatible with the duration of a typical ocular fixation.},

Properties such as colour or glossiness can help us decide whether a pancake is cooked, or a patch of pavement is icy. Most studies of surface appearance have emphasized textureless matte surfaces1, 2, 3, but real-world surfaces, which may have gloss and complex mesostructure, are now receiving increased attention4, 5, 6, 7. Their appearance results from a complex interplay of illumination, reflectance and surface geometry, which are difficult to tease apart given an image. If there were simple image statistics that were diagnostic of surface properties it would be sensible to use them8, 9, 10, 11. Here we show that the skewness of the luminance histogram and the skewness of sub-band filter outputs are correlated with surface gloss and inversely correlated with surface albedo (diffuse reflectance). We find evidence that human observers use skewness, or a similar measure of histogram asymmetry, in making judgements about surfaces. When the image of a surface has positively skewed statistics, it tends to appear darker and glossier than a similar surface with lower skewness, and this is true whether the skewness is inherent to the original image or is introduced by digital manipulation. We also find a visual after-effect based on skewness: adaptation to patterns with skewed statistics can alter the apparent lightness and glossiness of surfaces that are subsequently viewed. We suggest that there are neural mechanisms sensitive to skewed statistics, and that their outputs can be used in estimating surface properties.},

abstract = {The responses of extrastriate area V4 neurons to flashed visual stimuli were examined to determine whether the responses to stimulus sequences occurring at normal saccade and fixation timing intervals were degraded relative to longer timing intervals. Stimuli were flashed in receptive fields in the near periphery while monkeys maintained steady fixation. Short interstimulus intervals (ISIs) resulted in an overall habituation style response reduction. The transient component of responses to preferred stimuli was suppressed, often completely, when the ISI was reduced below 100 ms into the range of saccadic durations. The sustained response component weakened but remained intact. At short ISIs the trailing activity from the preceding stimulus blended with onset activity from the next stimulus, making it difficult to detect individual stimulus onset events within the spike train. Habituation or conditioning effects were correlated with the stimulus tuning sensitivity of the neuron but only loosely associated with the actual level of V4 activation elicited by preceding stimuli. The results suggest that sharply tuned neurons, because of their probabilistic inactivity, are particularly sensitive to temporal change, whereas the sustained components of broadly tuned neurons could provide a continuity of information flow across visual transients, such as saccades, that do not alter significantly the view by the neuron of the scene.},

The changes are believed to reflect the establishment of modules with different spatial processing emphasis. The receptive fields (RFs) of neurons within these modules, however, may not be governed by the same spatial topographic map parameters. Here it is shown that the RFs of area V4 neurons (centered 1‚Äì12¬∞ in eccentricity) are based on a circularly symmetric sampling of the primary visual cortical retinotopic map. No eccentricity dependent magnification beyond that observed in V1 is apparent in the V4 neurons. The size and shape of V4 RFs can be explained by a simple, constant sized, two-dimensional Gaussian sample of visual input from the retinotopic map laid out across the surface of V1. Inferences about the spatial scale of interactions within the receptive fields of neurons cannot be based on a visual area’s apparent cortical magnification derived from topographic mapping.},

Reports showing that activity in striate cortex can be dissociated from awareness, whereas the latter modulates activity in higher areas, point in this direction. In the specific case of visual motion, a central, “perceptual” role has been assigned to area V5: several human and monkey studies have shown V5 activity to correlate with the motion percept. Here we show that activity in this and other higher cortical areas can be also dissociated from perception and follow the physical stimulus instead. The motion information in a peripheral grating modulated fMRI responses, despite being invisible to human volunteers: under crowding conditions, areas V3A, V5, and parietal cortex still showed increased activity when the grating was moving compared to when it was flickering. We conclude that stimulus-specific activation of higher cortical areas does not necessarily result in awareness of the underlying stimulus.},

In the present study, we investigate whether the responses of this area are still governed by the motion percept when the latter is in conflict with the reality of the physical visual stimulation. We simultaneously presented two different, specially designed random-dot kinematograms, one to each eye. These stimuli either both had a single direction of motion and worked in synergy, or had opposite motion directions and thus cancelled each other out perceptually. In this way, we were able to pit the visual stimulus (one vs. two stimulating directions) against the reported perception (directional motion vs. motion noise) of human volunteers during fMRI experiments. We found that a strong motion stimulus that is weakly perceived is more effective in activating V5 (as well as V3) than a weaker motion stimulus, which is nevertheless robustly perceived. Thus, contrary to the prevailing view of perception being the correlate of activity in higher visual areas, we show here that activity is instead dominated by the properties of the physical stimulus, raising the question of whether there is a subpopulation of cells in V5 whose activity is critical for generating the motion percept. In addition, our results provide the first robust evidence for the presence of directionally selective neuronal populations in human prestriate cortex.},

abstract = {1. We have examined the spatial and temporal tuning properties of 238 cortical neurones, recorded using conventional techniques from acutely prepared anaesthetized cats. We determined spatial and temporal frequency tuning curves using sinusoidal grating stimuli presented to each neurone’s receptive field by a digital computer on a cathode ray tube. 2. We measured tuning curves either by determining response amplitude as a function of spatial or temporal frequency, or by measuring contrast sensitivity (the inverse of the contrast of the grating that just elicited a detectable response). The two measures give very similar tuning curves in all cases. 3. We recorded from 184 neurones in area 17; of these 156 had receptive fields within 5 degrees of the area centralis. The range of preferred spatial frequency for these neurones was 0.3--3 c/deg, and their spatial frequency tuning band widths varied from 0.7 to 3.2 octaves at half-amplitude. The most common band width was roughly 1.3 octaves. Simple and complex cells in area 17 did not differ in their distributions of preferred spatial frequency, although complex cells were, on average, slightly less selective for spatial frequency than simple cells. 4. We recorded from fifty-four neurones from area 18, and performed several experiments in which we recorded from corresponding portions of both area 17 and area 18 in the same electrode penetration. Neurones in area 18 preferred spatial frequencies that were, on average, one third as high as those preferred by area 17 neurones at the same retinal eccentricity. Thus the range of preferred spatial frequency in area eighteen cells having receptive fields within 5 deg of the area centralis was between less than 0.1 and 0.5 c/deg. The distributions of optimum spatial frequency in the two areas were practically non-overlapping at eccentricities as high as 15 deg, the greatest eccentricity we examined. Neurones in area 18 were about as selective for spatial frequency as were neurones in area 17. 5. We determined temporal frequency tuning characteristics for some neurones from each area, using gratings that moved steadily across the screen. Neurones from area 17 all responded well to low temporal frequencies, and less well to higher frequencies (in excess of, usually, 2 or 4 Hz). In contrast, neurones recorded from area 18 sometimes had similar tuning properties, but more commonly showed a pronounced reduction in response as the temporal frequency was moved either above or below some optimum value (usually 2--8 Hz). 6. We conclude from these results that areas 17 and 18 act in parallel to process different aspects of the visual information relayed from the retina via the lateral geniculate complex. Some or all of the differences between the areas may be attributable to the predominance of Y cell input to area 18 and the predominance of X cell input to area 17.},

One elegant strategy to investigate this information-rich feedback to V1 is to eliminate feedforward input, that is, exploit V1’s retinotopic organisation to isolate subregions receiving no direct bottom-up stimulation. We highlight the diverse mechanisms of cortical feedback, ranging from gain control to predictive coding, and conclude that V1 is involved in rich internal communication processes.},

It has been shown in previous studies that motion-sensitive regions in extrastriate cortex are relevant for the processing of apparent motion, but it is unclear whether primary visual cortex (V1) is also involved in the representation of the illusory motion path. We investigated, in human subjects, apparent-motion-related activity in patches of V1 representing locations along the path of illusory stimulus motion using functional magnetic resonance imaging. Here we show that apparent motion caused a blood-oxygenation-level-dependent response along the V1 representations of the apparent-motion path, including regions that were not directly activated by the apparent-motion-inducing stimuli. This response was unaltered when participants had to perform an attention-demanding task that diverted their attention away from the stimulus. With a bistable motion quartet, we confirmed that the activity was related to the conscious perception of movement. Our data suggest that V1 is part of the network that represents the illusory path of apparent motion. The activation in V1 can be explained either by lateral interactions within V1 or by feedback mechanisms from higher visual areas, especially the motion-sensitive human MT/V5 complex.},

During sleep with synchronized e.e.g. (S-sleep) the neurones fired in high frequency bursts with long pauses in between. Each burst was formed of 10-15 spikes. Often the bursts were followed by prolonged discharges formed of spikes well spaced one from the other. Bursts followed by prolonged activity were more commonly observed at the beginning of S-sleep and during the S-sleep periods preceding sleep with desynchronized e.e.g., whereas bursts immediately followed by silence were more frequent in the S-sleep periods with e.e.g. delta waves. The long periods of silence between the bursts usually lasted over 200 msec and values greater than 1 sec were frequently found.

abstract = {1. We investigated the time domain transformation that thalamocortical relay cells of the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) perform on their retinal input, and used computational modeling to explore the biophysical properties that determine the dynamics of the LGN relay cells in vivo. 2. We recorded simultaneously the input (S potentials) and output (action potentials) of 50 cat LGN relay cells stimulated by drifting sinusoidal gratings of varying temporal frequency. The temporal modulation transfer functions (TMTFs) of the neurons were derived from these data. The burstiness of the LGN spike trains was also assessed using objective criteria. 3. We found that the form of the TMTF was quite variable among cells, ranging from low-pass to strongly band-pass. The optimal temporal frequency of band-pass neurons was between 2 and 8 Hz. In addition, the TMTF of some cells was nonstationary: their temporal tuning changed with time. 4. The temporal tuning of a cell was directly related to the degree of burstiness of its spike train. Tonically firing relay cells had low-pass TMTFs, whereas the most bursty neurons exhibited the most sharply band-pass transfer functions. This was also true for single cells that altered their temporal tuning: a shift to more band-pass tuning was associated with increased burstiness of the spike train, and vice versa. 5. We constructed a computer simulation of the LGN relay cell. The model was a simplified five-channel version of the thalamocortical neuron model of McCormick and Huguenard. It incorporated the quantitative kinetics of the Ca2+ T channel, as well as the Hodgkin-Huxley Na+ and K+ channels, as the only active membrane currents. To simulate the in vivo dynamics of the relay cell, the input to the model consisted of trains of synaptic potentials, recorded as S potentials in our physiological experiments. 6. When the resting membrane potential of the model neuron was relatively depolarized, the model’s TMTF was low-pass, with no bursting evident in the simulated spike train. At hyperpolarized resting membrane potentials, however, the modeled TMTF was band-pass, with frequent burst discharges. Thus the biophysical model reproduced not only the range of dynamics seen in real LGN relay cells, but also the dependence of the overall dynamics on the burstiness of the spike train. However, neither of these phenomena could be simulated without the T channel. Thus the simulations demonstrated that the T-type Ca2+ channel was necessary and sufficient to explain the LGN dynamics observed in physiological experiments.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The maintained discharge of neurons along the early visual pathway in mammals constitutes the noise from which the visual signal must be discriminated. The statistics of this background noise in cat retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) have been shown to conform to that of a gamma-distributed renewal process (Kuffler et al., 1957; Barlow & Levick, 1969), and power spectrum analysis reveals that this property allows for low noise levels at the temporal-frequency range (0-10 Hz) most important for visual performance (Troy & Robson, 1992). In this study, we compare the statistics of the maintained discharge of cat lateral geniculate neurons with those of its RGC input by simultaneous recordings of spikes and S-potentials in single relay cells of the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN). We demonstrate that, during primarily tonic spiking activity, the LGN maintained discharge preserves the renewal process statistics of its RGC input and also generates relatively little noise at the temporal frequencies important for vision. However, during burst spiking activity, the renewal process model breaks down and increased noise is generated at 2-10 Hz. This suggests that optimization of the visual signal/noise ratio is not a prime consideration in the behavioral states associated with bursting activity in the LGN. The occurrence of burst spikes in LGN relay cells is dependent on the activity of T-type calcium channels in their plasma membranes (Jahnsen & Llinas, 1984a,b). We show that a computational model of LGN relay cells that incorporates T-channel kinetics (Mukherjee & Kaplan, 1995) can correctly simulate LGN maintained discharge statistics during both tonic and bursty firing conditions, and indicates an essential role for this ion channel in determining the dynamic noise properties of the LGN. We also use the computational model to predict how the burstiness of the LGN maintained discharge is affected by the statistics of its RGC input Type: JOURNAL ARTICLE Language: Eng},

In doing this, it will draw on multiple sources of expertise, learned from experience, creating multiple, often conflicting, hypotheses which are integrated by the action of the thalamic neurons and then sent back to the standard input layer of the cortex. Thus this nucleus plays the role of an ‘active blackboard’ on which the current best reconstruction of some aspect of the world is always displayed. Evidence for this theory is reviewed and experimental tests are proposed. A sequel to this paper will discuss the cortico-cortical loops and propose quite different computational roles for them.},

abstract = {This paper is a sequel to an earlier paper which proposed an active role for the thalamus, integrating multiple hypotheses formed in the cortex via the thalamo-cortical loop. In this paper, I put forward a hypothesis on the role of the reciprocal, topographic pathways between two cortical areas, one often a ‘higher’ area dealing with more abstract information about the world, the other ‘lower’, dealing with more concrete data. The higher area attempts to fit its abstractions to the data it receives from lower areas by sending back to them from its deep pyramidal cells a template reconstruction best fitting the lower level view. The lower area attempts to reconcile the reconstruction of its view that it receives from higher areas with what it knows, sending back from its superficial pyramidal cells the features in its data which are not predicted by the higher area. The whole calculation is done with all areas working simultaneously, but with order imposed by synchronous activity in the various top-down, bottom-up loops. Evidence for this theory is reviewed and experimental tests are proposed. A third part of this paper will deal with extensions of these ideas to the frontal lobe.},

The method delivers a number, termed oscillation score, that estimates the degree to which a neuron is oscillating in a given frequency band. Moreover, it can also reliably identify the oscillation frequency and strength in the given band, independently of the oscillation in other frequency bands, and thus it can handle superimposed oscillations on multiple scales (theta, alpha, beta, gamma, etc.). The method is relatively simple and fast. It can cope with a low number of spikes, converging exponentially fast with the number of spikes, to a stable estimation of the oscillation strength. It thus lends itself to the analysis of spike-sorted single-unit activity from electrophysiological recordings. We show that the method performs well on experimental data recorded from cat visual cortex and also compares favorably to other methods. In addition, we provide a measure, termed confidence score, that determines the stability of the oscillation score estimate over trials.},

Recent reports of a marked and consistent dislocation between orientation columns in the superficial and deep layers of cat striate cortex (Bauer, 1982, 1983) directly contradict the traditional view of the system (Hubel & Wiesel, 1962). This has considerable implications for our current understanding of cortical organization, and in order to clarify the issue we have carried out experiments to test the continuity of the columnar system with depth, in central regions of area 17. 2. In twenty-four penetrations, eighteen of which were placed as perpendicular as possible to the surface of the cortex, orientation preference was assessed at regular intervals both qualitatively and using a randomly interleaved quantitative technique. The distribution of preferred orientations was analysed with reference to a detailed histological reconstruction of the electrode track, including the location of laminar boundaries and the course of radial tiers of cells and capillaries. 3. From a further series of eighteen near-perpendicular penetrations, the change in average orientation between one superficial and one deep layer recording site was compared with the deviation of the track from perpendicular to the surface and hence parallel to the orientation columns. 4. In penetrations perpendicular to the surface of the cortex, orientation preference showed little variation between superficial and deep laminae. In oblique penetrations, preferred orientation generally changed according to a single, smooth trend. Those irregularities that were encountered were confined to oblique penetrations, and were distributed throughout the cortical laminae. 5. In conclusion, our evidence does not support the presence of a systematic discontinuity with depth within the orientation columnar system. It is therefore entirely consistent with earlier evidence on the subject.},

abstract = {In the feline visual system, neurons exhibiting sensitivity to the length of a moving contour were first observed in the cortex and described as ‘hypercomplex cells’. In these cells an increase in stimulus length beyond an optimal value leads to a rapid decline in response. This decline has been attributed to an intracortical inhibitory input which may be driven by layer VI cells with very long receptive fields. It is now clear, however, that cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), exhibit a degree of length tuning similar to that of cortical ‘hypercomplex cells’, suggesting that this response property could be generated subcortically. Alternatively, as the dLGN receives a massive corticofugal projection from layer VI cells in the visual cortex, it is possible that this input has a function in generating length tuning in the dLGN. We have investigated this issue by comparing the length tuning of dLGN cells with and without corticofugal feedback. The data show that corticofugal feedback makes a highly significant contribution to the length tuning of dLGN cells. This raises the possibility that length tuning is an emergent property of the geniculo-cortical loop.},

abstract = {1. Cells in the A laminae of the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus receive their primary innervation from either the contralateral (A) or ipsilateral (A1) eye. This paper provides evidence concerning the responses they give to visual stimulation of what is commonly regarded as the ineffective or non-dominant eye. It also examines the contribution of the corticofugal input to these responses. 2. Cells were identified and classified according to their responses to stimulation of the dominant eye receptive field. This was then occluded and the corresponding location in the non-dominant eye field stimulated by a moving bar. Out of fifty-seven cells examined forty-three (75%) gave a response to stimulation of the non-dominant eye. There was no obvious difference between the effects on X and Y cells in these experiments. 3. In most cases (thirty-seven) the response involved an inhibition of the resting discharge level, but three cells gave a mixed excitatory and inhibitory response and three a pure excitatory response. All the responses were weak and only revealed by prolonged periods of averaging (20-100 trials). 4. Ionophoretic application of the GABA antagonist N-methyl-bicuculline (NMB) blocked the visually elicited inhibitory effects and in most cases (twenty-seven out of thirty-two tested) revealed an excitatory response. Out of a further eight cells previously unresponsive to the non-dominant eye, NMB application revealed excitatory responses in three. 5. Increasing background discharge levels and cell excitability by ionophoretic application of either acetylcholine or the excitatory amino acid, quisqualate, did not eliminate inhibitory responses and did not reveal excitatory responses. We suggest that the visually driven non-dominant eye suppression of the background discharge involves a GABA-mediated inhibitory input which masks an underlying excitatory input. 6. An excitatory non-dominant eye response could potentially derive from the influence of the corticofugal projection. However, removal of the corticofugal input by aspiration of areas 17 and 18 did not reduce either the excitatory or the inhibitory components of the response. 7. In the absence of corticofugal input all cells tested (fourteen) exhibited a non-dominant eye response and all studied during NMB application (eleven) gave an excitatory response. The primary effect of removing the corticofugal input appeared to involve the loss of a ‘damping’ influence on the excitatory and inhibitory responses, such that they were more easily revealed. The significance of these findings is discussed.},

In particular, directional bias increased for 36% (12/33) of the cells that were facilitated by acetylcholine or acetyl-beta-methacholine and 43% (nine out of 21) of those that were inhibited, as compared with 9% (three out of 33) and 24% (five out of 21) for which the bias decreased. Six additional cells, of which three showed a reduced selectivity, were apparently excited by the drugs, in that the background discharge level was greatly increased with a concomitant decrease in signal-to-noise ratio. It is known that cholinergic input has the potential to enhance cortical function, by facilitating both the excitatory and the inhibitory components of the neuronal circuit. Our data show that this combination of effects can precipitate an enhancement of selectivity as well as of response magnitude.},

abstract = {Transmission through the lateral geniculate nucleus is facilitated following activation of the cholinergic input from the brain stem, which is thought to reflect activity patterns seen during arousal. One of the underlying mechanisms is the suppression of inhibitory circuits local to the lateral geniculate nucleus. However, evidence exists that some visually driven inhibitory inputs to geniculate nucleus. preserved or even enhanced under conditions of arousal, and during electrical activation of the parabrachial region of the brain stem. We have therefore reexamined the effect of brain-stem activation on the visual responses of one group of local inhibitory inputs to geniculate relay cells, those emanating from the adjacent perigeniculate nucleus. We recorded single perigeniculate cells in anesthetized, paralyzed cats. Axons innervating the lateral geniculate and perigeniculate nuclei from the parabrachial region of the brain stem were electrically activated, and the effect of this activation was assessed on both spontaneous and visually evoked responses. Visual stimulation consisted of sinusoidally modulated sine-wave gratings of varying spatial and temporal frequency. For the great majority of perigeniculate cells (32 of 40), brain-stem activation inhibited spontaneous activity, while one cell was excited, three showed a mixed effect and four were unaffected. Nevertheless, the responses of most cells (30 of 40) were facilitated when brain-stem activation was paired with certain spatio-temporal patterns of visual stimulation. Spatial tuning curves were constructed for 17 cells and temporal tuning curves for 14, before and during parabrachial activation. The responses of any one cell could be facilitated, unchanged, or suppressed, depending on the visual stimulus used. In some cases, this substantially modified the cell’s spatial and temporal tuning properties. We conclude that activation of the brain stem disinhibits geniculate relay cells in the absence of visual stimulation, but it has the potential to enhance either the magnitude or specificity of visually driven inhibition arising from the perigeniculate nucleus.},

abstract = {1. Vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) was iontophoretically applied to a population of 90 single cells in the primary visual cortex (area 17) of the cat. Response magnitude, response selectivity, spontaneous activity, and the ratio between the visual response and spontaneous activity (signal-to-noise ratio) of the cells were assessed quantitatively before and during drug application. 2. VIP had little effect in the absence of visual stimulation, with only 29/90 (32%) of the cells showing a change of even 1 sp/s in their spontaneous activity. In contrast it had a clear effect on the visual responses of the majority (73/90, 81%) of the cells tested. 3. VIP produced a substantial change (i.e., > or = 40%) in optimal response magnitude for 57 of the affected cells. Of these 65% were facilitated, usually with no change or an improvement in signal-to-noise ratio and direction selectivity. The remaining cells were inhibited, with more variable effects on their visual response characteristics, and were found predominantly in the superficial laminae. 4. The effects of VIP bore a remarkable resemblance to those reported previously for the muscarinic action of acetylcholine (ACh). VIP and a muscarinic cholinergic agonist, either ACh or acetyl-beta-methacholine (MeCh), were therefore applied in turn to a group of 40 cells. In 23 cases VIP and the muscarinic agonist were also applied simultaneously. 5. The effects of VIP and the cholinergic agonist matched in 92% of the cases where both drugs were effective. That is to say, cells that were facilitated by VIP were facilitated also by ACh or MeCh, and vice versa. In many instances there was a clear similarity in the pattern as well as the direction of the effects produced by the two substances. The result of simultaneous application was generally additive. 6. These data suggest that VIP and ACh activate very similar postsynaptic mechanisms, and share a closely related function at the level of individual cortical cells. Thus VIP may facilitate the responses of both the excitatory and the inhibitory components of the cortical circuit, leading to an overall increase in responsiveness and selectivity. In contrast to the cholinergic input from the basal forebrain, however, the VIP-positive cortical cells are likely to exert a very localized influence, over a circumscribed region of the cortex, in response to the presence of an effective visual stimulus.},

abstract = {The feedback from area 18 of the cat visual cortex to the lateral geniculate nucleus has been investigated by labeling and reconstructing seventeen axons of known receptive field position and eye preference. The distribution of boutons from each axon was quantified with respect to the compartments of the geniculate complex, and the results were compared with an equivalent analysis of fourteen area 17 axons. Area 18 axons form large, sparse arborizations that extend up to 1.9 mm laterally (1170 +/- 85 microm; mean +/- SEM), with a core of relatively dense innervation spanning on average 600 +/- 70 microm (mean +/- SEM). Thus, they have the potential to influence the transmission of visual information from well beyond their own classical receptive fields. In this respect, they are surprisingly similar to the axons from area 17, despite the fact that the two cortical areas have very different retinotopy. However, there are important differences between the pathways. Area 18 axons project more heavily to the C layers and medial interlaminar nucleus. Whereas the input from both areas to the A layers is biased toward the layer appropriate to the eye preference of each axon, the area 18 input to magnocellular layer C is not. The distribution of area 18 boutons favors the bottom of their preferred A layer, and the area 17 boutons favor the top. These differences mirror those seen in the afferent pathways, suggesting that each cortical area preferentially targets the cells from which it receives input. Finally, their greater diameter suggests that area 18 axons provide the earliest feedback signal in the corticogeniculate loop.},

Real-time quantitative PCR and in situ hybridization analyses confirmed the findings. Expression profiling of individual nuclei microdissected from the dorsal thalamus revealed additional subsets of nucleus-specific genes. Functional annotation using Gene Ontology (GO) vocabulary and Ingenuity Pathways Analysis revealed overrepresentation of GO categories related to development, morphogenesis, cell-cell interactions, and extracellular matrix within the thalamus- and nucleus-specific genes, many involved in the Wnt signaling pathway. Examples included the transcription factor TCF7L2, localized exclusively to excitatory neurons; a calmodulin-binding protein PCP4; the bone extracellular matrix molecules SPP1 and SPARC; and other genes involved in axon outgrowth and cell matrix interactions. Other nucleus-specific genes such as CBLN1 are involved in synaptogenesis. The genes identified likely underlie nuclear specification, cell phenotype, and connectivity during development and their maintenance in the adult thalamus.},

Neurons were also tested with static, luminance defined gratings to establish cue invariance. In addition, we used eight shapes defined either by relative motion or by luminance contrast, as used previously to test cue invariance in the infero-temporal (IT) cortex. A sizeable fraction (10-20%) of the V4 neurons responded selectively to kinetic patterns. Most neurons selective for kinetic contours had receptive fields (RFs) within the central 10 degrees of the visual field. Neurons selective for the orientation of kinetic gratings were defined as having similar orientation preferences for the two types of kinetic gratings, and the vast majority of these neurons also retained the same orientation preference for luminance defined gratings. Also, kinetic shape selective neurons had similar shape preferences when the shape was defined by relative motion or by luminance contrast, showing a cue-invariant form processing in V4. Although shape selectivity was weaker in V4 than what has been reported in the IT cortex, cue invariance was similar in the two areas, suggesting that invariance for luminance and motion cues of IT originates in V4. The neurons selective for kinetic patterns tended to be clustered within dorsal V4.},

abstract = {Motion is a potent cue for breaking camouflage in the natural world. To understand the neural basis of this phenomenon, one must utilize moving shapes defined by coherent motion of random texture elements against a similar, but stationary texture. To investigate how well neurons in area V4 process this novel, ecologically relevant stimulus and to compare shape selectivity for these shapes with static and other moving shapes, we tested V4 neurons with 5 static or moving shapes defined either by luminance or kinetic cues. The kinetic cues included a temporal frequency cue due to the difference in temporal frequencies of the moving dots inside the shape boundary and stationary dots outside the boundary. Therefore, static opponent motion‚Äìdefined shapes without this cue were tested as an additional control. Approximately 44% (95/216) of V4 neurons showed shape selectivity. Analyses of these selective neurons both at single-neuron and population levels revealed that the shape-selective V4 neurons responded selectively to the moving kinetic shapes and that these neurons demonstrated robust invariance for shape preference across different shape conditions. Cue-invariant shape selectivity was more pronounced when kinetic shapes included the temporal frequency cue. This invariance may be rooted in nonlinearities occurring early in the visual pathway.},

abstract = {Motion is a potent cue for the perception of three-dimensional (3D) shape in primates, but little is known about its underlying neural mechanisms. Guided by recent functional magnetic resonance imaging results, we tested neurons in the fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST) area of two macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta, one male) using motion-defined surface patches with various 3D shapes such as slanted planes, saddles, or cylinders. The majority of the FST neurons (>80%) were selective for stimuli depicting specific shapes, and all the surfaces tested were represented among the selective FST neurons. Importantly, this selectivity tolerated changes in speed, position, size, or between binocular and monocular presentations. This tolerance demonstrates that the 3D structure-from-motion (3D-SFM) selectivity of FST neurons is a higher-order selectivity, which cannot be reduced to a lower-order speed selectivity. The 3D-SFM selectivity of FST neurons was unaffected by removal of the opposed-motion cue that supplemented the speed gradient cue in the standard stimuli. When tested with the same standard stimuli, fewer neurons in the middle temporal/visual 5 (MT/V5) area were selective than FST neurons. In addition, selective MT/V5 neurons represented fewer types of surfaces and were less tolerant of stimulus changes than FST neurons. Overall, these results indicate that FST neurons code motion-defined 3D shape fragments, underscoring the central role of FST in processing 3D-SFM.},

Four hollow glass spheres filled with copper sulfate and iohexol were affixed to the surface of the animal’s skull prior to the acquisition of a series of coronal magnetic resonance (MR) images. These reference beads were visible in both X-ray and MR images. Cranial recording chambers were then implanted bilaterally over the amygdaloid complex. A microelectrode was advanced to various depths in the subject’s brain. At each selected microelectrode site, five radiographs were obtained and a small electrolytic lesion was made. Based on the data from the radiographs, we computed the position of the microelectrode tip at each site relative to the reference beads. With a precision of 625 microns, this method was used to predict the neuroanatomical location of ten microlesions placed in both subcortical and cortical structures. Postmortem histological analysis revealed that the actual location of the lesions closely matched predictions arrived at using the X-ray/MRI localization technique. This technique thus provides an accurate, reliable and noninvasive method for in vivo localization of microelectrode recording sites.},

J Neurosci 24:1428-1438]. To further test this hypothesis, we compared the strength of orientation and spatial phase selectivity of surround suppression, and the spatial extent of the extraclassical receptive field (ECRF) between the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and V1 neurons of anesthetized cats. Extraclassical surround suppression in the LGN was well tuned to orientation-contrast and relative spatial phase between the classical receptive field (CRF) and ECRF stimuli. Significant orientation-tuned surround suppression was observed in 72.6% of the LGN neurons and the 66.7% of the V1 neurons tested. The degree of orientation selectivity of ECRF in LGN was comparable to that in V1; however, the strength of the relative spatial phase selectivity of ECRF in LGN was higher than that previously reported for V1 [Akasaki T, Sato H, Yoshimura Y, Ozeki H, Shimegi S (2002) Suppressive effects of receptive field surround on neuronal activity in the cat primary visual cortex. Neurosci Res 43:207-220; DeAngelis GC, Freeman RD, Ohzawa I (1994) Length and width tuning of neurons in the cat’s primary visual cortex. J Neurophysiol 71:347-374]. In 70% of the LGN neurons that exhibited significant orientation-tuned extraclassical surround suppression, the effective orientation of the suppression varied according to a change in the orientation of CRF stimulus, while the remaining 30% exhibited a fixed preferred orientation of the suppression regardless of the orientation of the CRF grating. These results suggest that the basic properties of surround suppression, such as orientation and spatial phase tuning, already exist in cat LGN and that a decrease of surround suppression in excitatory inputs from LGN by surround suppression is the primary cause of surround suppression in V1. Corticogeniculate feedback may further elaborate the properties of surround suppression in LGN.},

Here, we develop a visually cued interval timing task that requires rats to decide when to perform an action following a brief visual stimulus. Using single-unit recordings and optogenetics in this task, we show that activity generated by the primary visual cortex (V1) embodies the target interval and may instruct the decision to time the action on a trial-by-trial basis. A spiking neuronal model of local recurrent connections in V1 produces neural responses that predict and drive the timing of future actions, rationalizing our observations. Our data demonstrate that the primary visual cortex may contribute to the instruction of visually cued timed actions.},

The efficacy of bottom-up signals modulated ongoing activity in dorsal fronto-parietal regions and transient activation of the ventral attention system. Our results demonstrate that the combination of computational, behavioral, and imaging techniques enables studying cognitive functions in ecologically valid contexts.

abstract = {In nonhuman primates (NHPs), secondary visual cortex (V2) is composed of repeating columnar stripes, which are evident in histological variations of cytochrome oxidase (CO) levels. Distinctive “thin” and “thick” stripes of dark CO staining reportedly respond selectively to stimulus variations in color and binocular disparity, respectively. Here, we first tested whether similar color-selective or disparity-selective stripes exist in human V2. If so, available evidence predicts that such stripes should (1) radiate “outward” from the V1–V2 border, (2) interdigitate, (3) differ from each other in both thickness and length, (4) be spaced ∼3.5–4 mm apart (center-to-center), and, perhaps, (5) have segregated functional connections. Second, we tested whether analogous segregated columns exist in a “next-higher” tier area, V3. To answer these questions, we used high-resolution fMRI (1 × 1 × 1 mm3) at high field (7 T), presenting color-selective or disparity-selective stimuli, plus extensive signal averaging across multiple scan sessions and cortical surface-based analysis. All hypotheses were confirmed. V2 stripes and V3 columns were reliably localized in all subjects. The two stripe/column types were largely interdigitated (e.g., nonoverlapping) in both V2 and V3. Color-selective stripes differed from disparity-selective stripes in both width (thickness) and length. Analysis of resting-state functional connections (eyes closed) showed a stronger correlation between functionally alike (compared with functionally unlike) stripes/columns in V2 and V3. These results revealed a fine-scale segregation of color-selective or disparity-selective streams within human areas V2 and V3. Together with prior evidence from NHPs, this suggests that two parallel processing streams extend from visual subcortical regions through V1, V2, and V3.

These pathways remain anatomically separate and distinct from their origination in different retinal ganglion cell types, through distinct layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus, and into primary visual cortex (V1), with the M pathway terminating primarily in layer 4Calpha, the P pathway in layer 4Cbeta, and the K pathway in the cytochrome oxidase blobs of layer 2/3. Recent studies indicate that outputs from V1 are less compartmental than previously thought, making it difficult to assess the contributions of M and P pathways to areas beyond V1 in the dorsal and ventral streams. Here we use rabies virus as a retrograde transsynaptic tracer to study the contributions of M and P pathways to areas middle temporal (MT), V3, and V2 of macaque monkey. We find that, although disynaptic inputs through layer 4C of V1 to dorsal stream area MT are dominated by the M pathway, within an additional three synapses MT receives a substantial P input. This P input is unlikely to reach MT via V3, which we show also receives disynaptic inputs dominated by the M pathway. We find that disynaptic inputs to V2, however, can be more balanced and may carry convergent M and P input to MT. Our observations provide evidence for multiple pathways from V1 to MT, with varying degrees of M and P convergence. Each pathway likely provides functionally specialized information to MT and dorsal stream visual processing.},

Using a modified rabies virus that expresses green fluorescent protein, we show that layer 4B neurons projecting to MT are a majority spiny stellate, whereas those projecting to V2 are overwhelmingly pyramidal. Regardless of cell type, MT-projecting neurons have larger cell bodies, more dendritic length, and are deeper within layer 4B. Furthermore, MT-projecting pyramidal neurons are located preferentially underneath cytochrome oxidase blobs, indicating that MT-projecting neurons of both types restrict their dendrites to M-recipient zones. We conclude that MT-projecting layer 4B neurons are specialized for the fast transmission of information from the M pathway, while V2-projecting neurons are likely to mediate slower computations involving mixed M and P signals.},

abstract = {Feedback connections are prevalent throughout the cerebral cortex, yet their function remains poorly understood. Previous studies in anesthetized monkeys found that inactivating feedback from extrastriate visual cortex produced effects in striate cortex that were relatively weak, generally suppressive, largest for visual stimuli confined to the receptive field center, and detectable only at low stimulus contrast. We studied the influence of corticocortical feedback in alert monkeys using cortical cooling to reversibly inactivate visual areas 2 (V2) and 3 (V3) while characterizing receptive field properties in primary visual cortex (V1). We show that inactivation of feedback from areas V2 and V3 results in both response suppression and facilitation for stimuli restricted to the receptive field center, in most cases leading to a small reduction in the degree of orientation selectivity but no change in orientation preference. For larger-diameter stimuli that engage regions beyond the center of the receptive field, eliminating feedback from V2 and V3 results in strong and consistent response facilitation, effectively reducing the strength of surround suppression in V1 for stimuli of both low and high contrast. For extended contours, eliminating feedback had the effect of reducing end stopping. Inactivation effects were largest for neurons that exhibited strong surround suppression before inactivation, and their timing matched the dynamics of surround suppression under control conditions. Our results provide direct evidence that feedback contributes to surround suppression, which is an important source of contextual influences essential to vision.},

abstract = {Normalization has been proposed as a canonical computation operating across different brain regions, sensory modalities, and species. It provides a good phenomenological description of non-linear response properties in primary visual cortex (V1), including the contrast response function and surround suppression. Despite its widespread application throughout the visual system, the underlying neural mechanisms remain largely unknown. We recently observed that corticocortical feedback contributes to surround suppression in V1, raising the possibility that feedback acts through normalization. To test this idea, we characterized area summation and contrast response properties in V1 with and without feedback from V2 and V3 in alert macaques and applied a standard normalization model to the data. Area summation properties were well explained by a form of divisive normalization, which computes the ratio between a neuron’s driving input and the spatially integrated activity of a “normalization pool.” Feedback inactivation reduced surround suppression by shrinking the spatial extent of the normalization pool. This effect was independent of the gain modulation thought to mediate the influence of contrast on area summation, which remained intact during feedback inactivation. Contrast sensitivity within the receptive field center was also unaffected by feedback inactivation, providing further evidence that feedback participates in normalization independent of the circuit mechanisms involved in modulating contrast gain and saturation. These results suggest that corticocortical feedback contributes to surround suppression by increasing the visuotopic extent of normalization and, via this mechanism, feedback can play a critical role in contextual information processing.},

Here we use rabies virus as a retrograde transynaptic tracer to show that the dorsal area MT receives strong input, via a single relay, from both M and P cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus. This surprising P input, likely relayed via layer 6 Meynert cells in primary visual cortex, can provide MT with sensitivity to a more complete range of spatial, temporal, and chromatic cues than the M pathway alone.

We tested this by optogenetically activating excitatory neurons in alert macaque primary visual cortex and measuring changes in neuronal activity as a function of stimulation intensity, with or without variable-contrast visual stimulation. Optogenetic depolarization of excitatory neurons either facilitated or suppressed baseline activity, consistent with indirect recruitment of inhibitory networks. As predicted by the normalization model, neurons exhibited sub-additive responses to optogenetic and visual stimulation, which depended lawfully on stimulation intensity and luminance contrast. We conclude that the normalization computation persists even under the artificial conditions of optogenetic stimulation, underscoring the canonical nature of this form of neural computation.},

Spikes at each location generated outward traveling LFP waves. When the visual stimulus was absent or had low contrast, these LFP waves had large amplitudes and traveled over long distances. Their effect was strong: LFP traces at any site could be predicted by the superposition of waves that were evoked by spiking in a 1.5-mm radius. As stimulus contrast increased, both the magnitude and the distance traveled by the waves progressively decreased. We conclude that the relative weight of feedforward and lateral inputs in visual cortex is not fixed, but rather depends on stimulus contrast. Lateral connections dominate at low contrast, when spatial integration of signals is perhaps most beneficial.},

abstract = {Although the role of the middle temporal (MT/V5) area and its medial superior temporal (MST) satellites in motion processing has been well explored, relatively little is known about motion regions located more rostrally in the superior temporal sulcus (STS), such as the fundus of the superior temporal (FST) area, the superior temporal polysensory (STP) region, or beyond. To fill this void, we used contrast-enhanced functional magnetic resonance imaging in awake macaques and a five-step testing procedure that allowed us to identify six motion-sensitive regions within the STS. Direction adaptation tests confirmed the motion sensitivity of these six regions. Five of them [MT/V5, its three satellites, and the middle part of the STP (STPm) region in the upper bank of the STS] have been documented by previous single-cell studies. A sixth, previously unknown motion-responsive region, which we termed the lower superior temporal (LST) region, was observed on the lower bank and fundus of the STS, 6-8 mm anterior to the FST area. In contrast to the MST areas, the LST region responds to slow as well as fast speeds and is responsive to static and moving images of objects, to patterns defined by opponent motion, and to actions. These results, obtained in both group and single-subject analyses, suggest that motion information in the STS might follow a second path, in addition to the MT/V5-MST path. This ventral path including the LST region, FST area, and STPm region is likely involved in the visual analysis of actions and biological motion.},

abstract = {In the early stages of image analysis, visual cortex represents scenes as spatially organized maps of locally defined features (e.g., edge orientation). As image reconstruction unfolds and features are assembled into larger constructs, cortex attempts to recover semantic content for object recognition. It is conceivable that higher level representations may feed back onto early processes and retune their properties to align with the semantic structure projected by the scene; however, there is no clear evidence to either support or discard the applicability of this notion to the human visual system. Obtaining such evidence is challenging because low and higher level processes must be probed simultaneously within the same experimental paradigm. We developed a methodology that targets both levels of analysis by embedding low-level probes within natural scenes. Human observers were required to discriminate probe orientation while semantic interpretation of the scene was selectively disrupted via stimulus inversion or reversed playback. We characterized the orientation tuning properties of the perceptual process supporting probe discrimination; tuning was substantially reshaped by semantic manipulation, demonstrating that low-level feature detectors operate under partial control from higher level modules. The manner in which such control was exerted may be interpreted as a top-down predictive strategy whereby global semantic content guides and refines local image reconstruction. We exploit the novel information gained from data to develop mechanistic accounts of unexplained phenomena such as the classic face inversion effect.},

We demonstrate how this system can be used to decouple neuronal firing levels from ongoing changes in network excitability due to multi-hour periods of glutamatergic or GABAergic neurotransmission blockade in vitro as well as impinging vibrissal sensory drive in vivo. This technology enables continuous, precise optical control of firing in neuronal populations in order to disentangle causally related variables of circuit activation in a physiologically and ethologically relevant manner.},

We measured the threshold intensity for which the monkey could successfully complete a direction discrimination. In the contrast task, we measured the threshold contrast for which the monkeys could successfully discriminate the orientation of stationary gratings. Injections of ibotenic acid into MT caused striking elevations in motion thresholds, but had little or no effect on contrast thresholds.

abstract = {The pulvinar nuclei appear to function as the subcortical visual pathway that bypasses the striate cortex, rapidly processing coarse facial information. We investigated responses from monkey pulvinar neurons during a delayed non-matching-to-sample task, in which monkeys were required to discriminate five categories of visual stimuli [photos of faces with different gaze directions, line drawings of faces, face-like patterns (three dark blobs on a bright oval), eye-like patterns and simple geometric patterns]. Of 401 neurons recorded, 165 neurons responded differentially to the visual stimuli. These visual responses were suppressed by scrambling the images. Although these neurons exhibited a broad response latency distribution, face-like patterns elicited responses with the shortest latencies (approximately 50 ms). Multidimensional scaling analysis indicated that the pulvinar neurons could specifically encode face-like patterns during the first 50-ms period after stimulus onset and classify the stimuli into one of the five different categories during the next 50-ms period. The amount of stimulus information conveyed by the pulvinar neurons and the number of stimulus-differentiating neurons were consistently higher during the second 50-ms period than during the first 50-ms period. These results suggest that responsiveness to face-like patterns during the first 50-ms period might be attributed to ascending inputs from the superior colliculus or the retina, while responsiveness to the five different stimulus categories during the second 50-ms period might be mediated by descending inputs from cortical regions. These findings provide neurophysiological evidence for pulvinar involvement in social cognition and, specifically, rapid coarse facial information processing.},

abstract = {Viral vectors are promising tools for the dissection of neural circuits. In principle, they can manipulate neurons at a level of specificity not otherwise achievable. While many studies have used viral vector-based approaches in the rodent brain, only a few have employed this technique in the non-human primate, despite the importance of this animal model for neuroscience research. Here, we report evidence that a viral vector-based approach can be used to manipulate a monkey’s behavior in a task. For this purpose, we used the allatostatin receptor/allatostatin (AlstR/AL) system, which has previously been shown to allow inactivation of neurons in vivo. The AlstR was expressed in neurons in monkey V1 by injection of an adeno-associated virus 1 (AAV1) vector. Two monkeys were trained in a detection task, in which they had to make a saccade to a faint peripheral target. Injection of AL caused a retinotopic deficit in the detection task in one monkey. Specifically, the monkey showed marked impairment for detection targets placed at the visual field location represented at the virus injection site, but not for targets shown elsewhere. We confirmed that these deficits indeed were due to the interaction of AlstR and AL by injecting saline, or AL at a V1 location without AlstR expression. Post-mortem histology confirmed AlstR expression in this monkey. We failed to replicate the behavioral results in a second monkey, as AL injection did not impair the second monkey’s performance in the detection task. However, post-mortem histology revealed a very low level of AlstR expression in this monkey. Our results demonstrate that viral vector-based approaches can produce effects strong enough to influence a monkey’s performance in a behavioral task, supporting the further development of this approach for studying how neuronal circuits control complex behaviors in non-human primates.},

We trained humans and monkeys to discriminate between the members of small natural-image sets. We employed the “Bubbles” procedure to determine the stimulus features used by the observers. On average, monkeys used image features drawn from a diagnostic region covering about 7% +/- 2% of the images. Humans were able to use image features drawn from a much larger diagnostic region covering on average 51% +/- 4% of the images. Similarly for the two species, however, about 2% of the image needed to be visible within the diagnostic region on any individual trial for correct performance. We characterize the low-level image properties of the diagnostic regions and discuss individual differences among the monkeys. Our results reveal that monkeys base their behavior on confined image patches and essentially ignore a large fraction of the visual input, whereas humans are able to gather visual information with greater flexibility from large image regions.},

Correlations between reported disparity signs and disparity noise samples for each trial yielded detection ‘filters’. Filter amplitude was greater at near disparities than at far disparities, indicating that the subjects relied more on near disparities. Recordings from both macaques’ disparity-selective V2 neurons showed a correlation between neuronal responses and perceptual judgment in near-preferring, but not far-preferring, units, mirroring the psychophysically measured strategy. After one monkey learned to weight near and far disparities equally, activity in its far-preferring neurons correlated with choice.

abstract = {During perceptual decisions, the activity of sensory neurons correlates with a subject’s percept, even when the physical stimulus is identical. The origin of this correlation is unknown. Current theory proposes a causal effect of noise in sensory neurons on perceptual decisions, but the correlation could result from different brain states associated with the perceptual choice (a top-down explanation). These two schemes have very different implications for the role of sensory neurons in forming decisions. Here we use white-noise analysis to measure tuning functions of V2 neurons associated with choice and simultaneously measure how the variation in the stimulus affects the subjects’ (two macaques) perceptual decisions. In causal models, stronger effects of the stimulus upon decisions, mediated by sensory neurons, are associated with stronger choice-related activity. However, we find that over the time course of the trial these measures change in different directions-at odds with causal models. An analysis of the effect of reward size also supports this conclusion. Finally, we find that choice is associated with changes in neuronal gain that are incompatible with causal models. All three results are readily explained if choice is associated with changes in neuronal gain caused by top-down phenomena that closely resemble attention. We conclude that top-down processes contribute to choice-related activity. Thus, even forming simple sensory decisions involves complex interactions between cognitive processes and sensory neurons.},

abstract = {Eye evolution is driven by the evolution of visually guided behavior. Accumulation of gradually more demanding behaviors have continuously increased the performance requirements on the photoreceptor organs. Starting with nondirectional photoreception, I argue for an evolutionary sequence continuing with directional photoreception, low-resolution vision, and finally, high-resolution vision. Calculations of the physical requirements for these four sensory tasks show that they correlate with major innovations in eye evolution and thus work as a relevant classification for a functional analysis of eye evolution. Together with existing molecular and morphological data, the functional analysis suggests that urbilateria had a simple set of rhabdomeric and ciliary receptors used for directional photoreception, and that organ duplications, positional shifts and functional shifts account for the diverse patterns of eyes and photoreceptors seen in extant animals. The analysis also suggests that directional photoreception evolved independently at least twice before the last common ancestor of bilateria and proceeded several times independently to true vision in different bilaterian and cnidarian groups. This scenario is compatible with Pax-gene expression in eye development in the different animal groups. The whole process from the first opsin to high-resolution vision took about 170 million years and was largely completed by the onset of the Cambrian, about 530 million years ago. Evolution from shadow detectors to multiple directional photoreceptors has further led to secondary cases of eye evolution in bivalves, fan worms, and chitons.},

abstract = {Parallel visual pathways in the primate brain known as the dorsal and ventral streams receive retinal inputs mainly through the magnocellular (M) and parvocellular (P) layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Inputs from these layers terminate within distinct parts of layer 4C of V1 (visual area 1). Due to the complexity of M- and P-derived neural connectivity in V1 and higher visual areas, the contributions of M and P inputs to the dorsal and ventral streams remain unclear. Employing retrograde transsynaptic transport of rabies virus, we analyzed the architecture of bottom-up pathways toward ventral stream area V4 (visual area 4) and dorsal stream area MT (middle temporal area). We found that V4 receives both M and P inputs “trisynaptically” from layer 4C via layer 2/3 of V1, whereas MT receives M-dominant input “disynaptically” from layer 4C via layer 4B of V1. V4 also receives disynaptic input from the dorsal stream portion of V2 (visual area 2) (i.e., cytochrome oxidase-stained thick stripes). Moreover, both M and P inputs reach V4 trisynaptically and MT disynaptically through “short-cut” pathways that bypass layer 4C of V1. The differential patterns of multisynaptic geniculo-cortical pathways to V4 and MT imply distinct modes of information processing in the dorsal and ventral streams.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: To what extent is activity of individual neurons coupled to the local field potential (LFP) and to blood-oxygenation-level dependent (BOLD) functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI)? This issue is of high significance for understanding brain function and for relating animal studies to fMRI, yet it is still under debate. RESULTS: Here we report data from simultaneous recordings of isolated unit activity and LFP by using multiple electrodes in the human auditory cortex. We found a wide range of coupling levels between the activity of individual neurons and gamma LFP. However, this large variability could be predominantly explained (r = 0.66) by the degree of firing-rate correlations between neighboring neurons. Importantly, this phenomenon occurred during both sensory stimulation and spontaneous activity. Concerning the coupling of neuronal activity to BOLD fMRI, we found that gamma LFP was well coupled to BOLD measured across different individuals (r = 0.62). By contrast, the coupling of single units to BOLD was highly variable and, again, tightly related to interneuronal-firing-rate correlations (r = 0.70). CONCLUSIONS: Our results offer a resolution to a central controversy regarding the coupling between neurons, LFP, and BOLD signals by demonstrating, for the first time, that the coupling of single units to the other measures is variable yet it is tightly related to the degree of interneuronal correlations in the human auditory cortex.},

abstract = {The sequential analysis of information in a coarse-to-fine manner is a fundamental mode of processing in the visual pathway. Spatial frequency (SF) tuning, arguably the most fundamental feature of spatial vision, provides particular intuition within the coarse-to-fine framework: low spatial frequencies convey global information about an image (e.g., general orientation), while high spatial frequencies carry more detailed information (e.g., edges). In this paper, we study the development of cortical spatial frequency tuning. As feedforward input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) has been shown to have significant influence on cortical coarse-to-fine processing, we present a firing-rate based thalamocortical model which includes both feedforward and feedback components. We analyze the relationship between various model parameters (including cortical feedback strength) and responses. We confirm the importance of the antagonistic relationship between the center and surround responses in thalamic relay cell receptive fields (RFs), and further characterize how specific structural LGN RF parameters affect cortical coarse-to-fine processing. Our results also indicate that the effect of cortical feedback on spatial frequency tuning is age-dependent: in particular, cortical feedback more strongly affects coarse-to-fine processing in kittens than in adults. We use our results to propose an experimentally testable hypothesis for the function of the extensive feedback in the corticothalamic circuit.},

Temporal patterning of inputs to different modalities may provide critical information about whether those inputs are related or not. We studied effects of temporal correspondence between auditory and visual streams on human brain activity with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI). Streams of visual flashes with irregularly jittered, arrhythmic timing could appear on right or left, with or without a stream of auditory tones that coincided perfectly when present (highly unlikely by chance), were noncoincident with vision (different erratic, arrhythmic pattern with same temporal statistics), or an auditory stream appeared alone. fMRI revealed blood oxygenation level-dependent (BOLD) increases in multisensory superior temporal sulcus (mSTS), contralateral to a visual stream when coincident with an auditory stream, and BOLD decreases for noncoincidence relative to unisensory baselines. Contralateral primary visual cortex and auditory cortex were also affected by audiovisual temporal correspondence or noncorrespondence, as confirmed in individuals. Connectivity analyses indicated enhanced influence from mSTS on primary sensory areas, rather than vice versa, during audiovisual correspondence. Temporal correspondence between auditory and visual streams affects a network of both multisensory (mSTS) and sensory-specific areas in humans, including even primary visual and auditory cortex, with stronger responses for corresponding and thus related audiovisual inputs.},

Sequences of flashes at 4, 6, and 8 Hz were presented centrally, or at horizontal eccentricities of 6 degrees or 18 degrees. Concurrent sequences of clicks were presented at the same rate as the flashes, or at higher or lower rates. Subjects judged whether the flash rate was the same as (synchronous with), faster than, or slower than the click rate. With the 4- and 6-Hz flash rates, subjects’ judgments of audiovisual synchrony increased with increasing eccentricity, but only when the click rate was more rapid than the flash rate. This effect remained even when the size of the peripheral visual stimuli was adjusted to compensate for cortical magnification, and was not significantly influenced by the spatial proximity of the auditory and visual signals. However, it was absent when the auditory and visual stimuli were presented serially rather than concurrently. With the 8-Hz flash rate, synchrony judgments were prevalent irrespective of eccentricity. When two serially presented flash rates were compared, visual-visual matching judgments increased with eccentricity at flash rates of 6 Hz and higher, but decreased at flash rates below 6 Hz. Finally, when two concurrent flash rates were compared, visual-visual synchrony judgments increased with eccentricity at all flash-rate combinations. Together, these results suggest that while perceptual uncertainty can play a role in synchrony judgments at rates of 6 Hz and higher, below 6 Hz eccentricity produces a widening of the window of apparent audiovisual temporal synchrony which perceptual uncertainty cannot explain.},

By fitting the summation curves to a difference of Gaussians model, we attributed this contrast-dependent effect to an actual change in the size of the center mechanism. Analogous changes in spatial frequency tuning were also observed, specifically increased peaks and cut-off frequencies with contrast. These effects were seen across the populations of both X and Y cell types. In a few cases, LGN cells were recorded simultaneously with one of their retinal ganglion cell (RGC) inputs (S-potentials). In every case, the RGCs exhibited similar contrast-dependent effects in the space and spatial-frequency domains. We propose that this contrast dependency in the retinal ganglion cells results directly from a reduction in the size of the center mechanism due to an increase in contrast. We also propose that these properties first arise in the retina and are transmitted passively through the LGN to visual cortex.},

abstract = {The receptive fields of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are shaped by their diverse set of impinging inputs: feedforward synaptic inputs stemming from retina, and feedback inputs stemming from the visual cortex and the thalamic reticular nucleus. To probe the possible roles of these feedforward and feedback inputs in shaping the temporal receptive-field structure of LGN relay cells, we here present and investigate a minimal mechanistic firing-rate model tailored to elucidate their disparate features. The model for LGN relay ON cells includes feedforward excitation and inhibition (via interneurons) from retinal ON cells and excitatory and inhibitory (via thalamic reticular nucleus cells and interneurons) feedback from cortical ON and OFF cells. From a general firing-rate model formulated in terms of Volterra integral equations, we derive a single delay differential equation with absolute delay governing the dynamics of the system. A freely available and easy-to-use GUI-based MATLAB version of this minimal mechanistic LGN circuit model is provided. We particularly investigate the LGN relay-cell impulse response and find through thorough explorations of the model’s parameter space that both purely feedforward models and feedback models with feedforward excitation only, can account quantitatively for previously reported experimental results. We find, however, that the purely feedforward model predicts two impulse response measures, the time to first peak and the biphasic index (measuring the relative weight of the rebound phase) to be anticorrelated. In contrast, the models with feedback predict different correlations between these two measures. This suggests an experimental test assessing the relative importance of feedforward and feedback connections in shaping the impulse response of LGN relay cells.},

We performed voltage-sensitive dye imaging across the primary visual cortex (V1) to capture responses to sequences of natural scene contours. We presented vertically and horizontally filtered natural images, and their superpositions, at 10 or 33 Hz. At low frequency, the encoding was found to represent not the currently presented images, but differences in orientation between consecutive images. This was in sharp contrast to more rapid sequences for which we found an ongoing representation of current input, consistent with earlier studies. Our finding that for slower image sequences, V1 does no longer report actual features but represents their relative difference in time counteracts the view that the first cortical processing stage must always transfer complete information. Instead, we show its capacities for change detection with a new emphasis on the role of automatic computation evolving in the 100-ms range, inevitably affecting information transmission further downstream.},

In 146 cells, responses to a single line over the center of the receptive field were compared with those to full texture patterns in which the center line was surrounded by similar lines at either the same orientation (uniform texture) or the orthogonal orientation (orientation contrast). On average, the responses to single lines were reduced by 42% when texture was presented in the surround. Uniform textures often produced stronger suppression (7% more, on average) so that lines with orientation contrast on average evoked larger responses than lines in uniform texture fields. This difference is correlated with perceptual differences between such stimuli, suggesting that physiological mechanisms contributing to the saliency (”popout”) of textural stimuli operate, at least to some degree, even under anesthesia. Significant response modulation by the texture surround was seen in 112 cells (77%). Fifty-three cells (36%) responded differently to the two texture patterns; response preferences for orientation contrast (35 cells; 24%) were seen more often than preferences for uniform textures (18 cells; 12%). The remaining 59 cells (40%) were similarly suppressed by both texture surrounds. Detailed analysis of texture modulation revealed two major components of surround effects: (1) fast nonspecific (”general”) suppression that occurred at about the same latency as excitatory responses and was found in all layers of striate cortex; and (2) differential response modulation that began about 60-70 ms after stimulus onset (about 15-20 ms after the onset of the excitatory response) and was less homogeneously distributed over cortical layers.},

abstract = {Human speed discrimination thresholds follow Weber’s law over a large range of reference (i.e., pedestal) speeds, that is, the just-noticeable-difference in speed scales in proportion to the reference speed. We analyzed the neural representation of speed information in macaque middle temporal visual area (MT) to determine whether this representation can account for the basic form of psychophysical data. Based on theoretical considerations, we hypothesized: (1) that the speed tuning curves of MT neurons should be bell-shaped (Gaussian) as a function of the logarithm of speed, (2) that the set of speed-tuning curves should be approximately scale-invariant, (3) that the distribution of speed preferences should be approximately uniform in log speed, and (4) that response variability should be independent of speed preference. Our quantitative analysis of data from 501 MT neurons shows that the neural representation of speed approximately obeys these constraints, with modest deviations particularly at slow speeds. We then used the MT data to predict how speed discrimination thresholds should depend on pedestal speed. The shape of this prediction matches very closely to that of human psychophysical data, accounting for constant Weber fractions over a large range of intermediate speeds as well as a marked departure from Weber’s law at slow speeds. Moreover, we show that deviations of the MT representation from the above constraints are important for predicting how psychophysical thresholds depart from Weber’s law at slow speeds. These findings support the notion that a logarithmic, approximately scale-invariant representation of speed in area MT limits perceptual speed discrimination.},

abstract = {Much is known about the anatomy of corticocortical connections, yet little is known concerning their physiology. In order to have access to the synaptic and temporal aspects of the activity elicited through corticocortical connections, we developed an in vitro approach on slices of rat visual cortex. We used extracellular recordings of field potentials combined with electrical stimulation to localise regions of areas 17 and 18a that are connected. We found that corticocortical connections between areas 17 and 18a can be preserved in 500 microm thick slices, with a focus of activity separated from the stimulating electrode by 1.5 mm to more than 3 mm. The potentials elicited in one area after stimulation of its neighbour displayed fast events, corresponding to action potentials, and slow events, corresponding to synaptic potentials. Intracellular recordings showed that the earliest synaptic responses consisted of monosynaptic excitatory potentials. Measurement of response latency showed that axons involved in both feedforward and feedback corticocortical connections are slowly conducting (0.3-0.8 m/s). Conduction velocity for antidromically activated cells was not significantly different for the two sets of connections. In an attempt to establish the spatial organisation of functional synaptic inputs, field potential recordings were performed in the different cortical layers and used to establish current source density (CSD) graphs along the depth axis. The CSD maps obtained were found to be somewhat variable from one case to another. It is suggested that this variability results from the use of electrical stimulation, which activates axons that are both afferent and efferent to a given cortical area. The field potentials are therefore likely to contain responses that correspond to the activity mediated by the intrinsic collaterals mixed in variable amount with responses produced by corticocortical synapses. With this restriction in mind, it is suggested that, after stimulation of the supragranular layers, the functional synaptic inputs of feedforward connections are concentrated in layer 4 and the bottom of layer 3, while those of feedback axons involve mainly the upper part of the supragranular layers. The intrinsic collaterals of the neurones participating in corticocortical connections seem also to provide the bulk of their inputs to the upper part of the supragranular layers. The laminar pattern of activity obtained after infragranular layer stimulation was comparable to that obtained after supragranular layer stimulation, except for the addition of a supplementary region of activated synapses in the infragranular layers Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

Electrophysiological Classes of Cat Primary Visual Cortical Neurons In Vivo as Revealed by Quantitative Analyses. J. Neurophysiol. 89: 1541-1566, 2003. To facilitate the characterization of cortical neuronal function, the responses of cells in cat area 17 to intracellular injection of current pulses were quantitatively analyzed. A variety of response variables were used to separate the cells into subtypes using cluster analysis. Four main classes of neurons could be clearly distinguished: regular spiking (RS), fast spiking (FS), intrinsic bursting (IB), and chattering (CH). Each of these contained significant subclasses. RS neurons were characterized by trains of action potentials that exhibited spike frequency adaptation. Morphologically, these cells were spiny stellate cells in layer 4 and pyramidal cells in layers 2, 3, 5, and 6. FS neurons had short-duration action potentials (<0.5 ms at half height), little or no spike frequency adaptation, and a steep relationship between injected current intensity and spike discharge frequency. Morphologically, these cells were sparsely spiny or aspiny nonpyramidal cells. IB neurons typically generated a low frequency (<425 Hz) burst of spikes at the beginning of a depolarizing current pulse followed by a tonic train of action potentials for the remainder of the pulse. These cells were observed in all cortical layers, but were most abundant in layer 5. Finally, CH neurons generated repetitive, high-frequency (350-700 Hz) bursts of short-duration (<0.55 ms) action potentials. Morphologically, these cells were layer 2-4 (mainly layer 3) pyramidal or spiny stellate neurons. These results indicate that firing properties do not form a continuum and that cortical neurons are members of distinct electrophysiological classes and subclasses},

abstract = {Neurons in cat area 17 can be grouped in 4 different electrophysiological cell classes (regular spiking, intrinsically bursting, chattering, and fast spiking [FS]). However, little is known of the functional properties of these different cell classes. Here we compared orientation and direction selectivity between these cell classes in cat area 17 and found that a subset of FS inhibitory neurons, usually with complex receptive fields, exhibited little selectivity in comparison with other cell types. Differences in occurrence and amplitude of gamma-range membrane fluctuations, as well as in numbers of action potentials in response to optimal visual stimuli, did not parallel differences observed for orientation and direction selectivity. Instead, differences in selectivity resulted mostly from differences in tuning of the membrane potential responses, although variations in spike threshold also contributed: weakly selective FS neurons exhibited both a lower spike threshold and more broadly tuned membrane potential responses in comparison with the other cell classes. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that a subgroup of FS neurons receives connections and possesses intrinsic properties allowing the generation of weakly selective responses. The existence of weakly selective inhibitory neurons is consistent with orientation selectivity models that rely on broadly tuned inhibition.},

abstract = {How does the brain learn to recognize objects visually, and perform this difficult feat robustly in the face of many sources of ambiguity and variability? We present a computational model based on the biology of the relevant visual pathways that learns to reliably recognize 100 different object categories in the face of naturally occurring variability in location, rotation, size, and lighting. The model exhibits robustness to highly ambiguous, partially occluded inputs. Both the unified, biologically plausible learning mechanism and the robustness to occlusion derive from the role that recurrent connectivity and recurrent processing mechanisms play in the model. Furthermore, this interaction of recurrent connectivity and learning predicts that high-level visual representations should be shaped by error signals from nearby, associated brain areas over the course of visual learning. Consistent with this prediction, we show how semantic knowledge about object categories changes the nature of their learned visual representations, as well as how this representational shift supports the mapping between perceptual and conceptual knowledge. Altogether, these findings support the potential importance of ongoing recurrent processing throughout the brain’s visual system and suggest ways in which object recognition can be understood in terms of interactions within and between processes over time.},

We examined how the relative importance of each of these processes dynamically changes over the course of a visual search in area V4 of two macaque monkeys. The animals were trained to perform a multidimensional visual search task in which a search array that consisted of two singleton stimuli, unique in shape and color, and four nonsingleton stimuli was presented. The task was to select one of the singletons as the saccade target, depending on the instructed search dimension, which was switched between shape and color. The strengths of the neural modulations caused by the bottom-up and top-down factors were, respectively, evaluated by assessing the dependence of the visual responses on the singleton type and the behavioral significance of the receptive field stimulus. We found that the initial visual responses of V4 neurons predominantly specified the singleton type of the receptive field stimulus, while the late presaccadic response primarily specified its behavioral significance. For comparison, recordings were also made from the frontal eye field (FEF) of one monkey and we found that the predominant activity of FEF neurons signaled the behavioral significance of the receptive field stimulus over time. These findings suggest that area V4 might function as an intermediate stage where both sensory- and behavior-based signals are dynamically represented, depending on their online requirements during a visual search, whereas the FEF predominantly represents behavior-based signals for upcoming saccade responses.},

In this study, we examine the effects of five optogenetic constructs in the macaque frontal eye field and use electrical microstimulation to assess whether optical perturbation of the local network leads to observable motor changes during optical, electrical, and combined stimulation. We report a significant increase in the probability of evoking saccadic eye movements when low current electrical stimulation is coupled to optical stimulation compared with when electrical stimulation is used alone. Experiments combining channelrhodopsin 2 (ChR2) and electrical stimulation with simultaneous fMRI revealed no discernible fMRI activity at the electrode tip with optical stimulation but strong activity with electrical stimulation. Our findings suggest that stimulation with current ChR2 optogenetic constructs generates subthreshold activity that contributes to the initiation of movements but, in most cases, is not sufficient to evoke a motor response.},

This map contains ‘orientation pinwheels’, structures that are arranged like the spokes of a wheel such that orientation changes continuously around a centre. Conventional optical imaging first demonstrated these pinwheels, but the technique lacked the spatial resolution to determine the response properties and arrangement of cells near pinwheel centres. Electrophysiological recordings later demonstrated sharply selective neurons near pinwheel centres, but it remained unclear whether they were arranged randomly or in an orderly fashion. Here we use two-photon calcium imaging in vivo to determine the microstructure of pinwheel centres in cat visual cortex with single-cell resolution. We find that pinwheel centres are highly ordered: neurons selective to different orientations are clearly segregated even in the very centre. Thus, pinwheel centres truly represent singularities in the cortical map. This highly ordered arrangement at the level of single cells suggests great precision in the development of cortical circuits underlying orientation selectivity.},

We performed multielectrode recordings in the LGN of immature awake ferrets and found simple fall-off-shaped, rather than Mexican hat-shaped, patterns of correlated activity. A weak surround in the LGN neuron’s receptive field and the statistics of the input contributed to this pattern of correlated activity. Computer simulation of cortical receptive field development incorporating the experimentally observed activity patterns demonstrated that a simple-cell receptive field emerges when a newly devised ‘split’ constraint on synaptic growth is combined with Hebbian synaptic modification rules. Thus, given certain developmental constraints on synaptic plasticity, patterns of correlated activity within the LGN are compatible with Hebbian models of simple-cell receptive field development.},

This model, which uses a simple functional operation (normalization) for which there is considerable experimental support, also accounts for the recent observation that the mathematical rule by which multisensory neurons combine their inputs changes with cue reliability. The normalization model, which makes a strong testable prediction regarding cross-modal suppression, may therefore provide a simple unifying computational account of the important features of multisensory integration by neurons.},

year = {1992}, 
abstract = {1. We studied how neurons in the middle temporal visual area (MT) of anesthetized macaque monkeys responded to textured and nontextured visual stimuli. Stimuli contained a central rectangular “figure” that was either uniform in luminance or consisted of an array of oriented line segments. The figure moved at constant velocity in one of four orthogonal directions. The region surrounding the figure was either uniform in luminance or contained a texture array (whose elements were identical or orthogonal in orientation to those of the figure), and it either was stationary or moved along with the figure. 2. A textured figure moving across a stationary textured background (”texture bar” stimulus) often elicited vigorous neural responses, but, on average, the responses to texture bars were significantly smaller than to solid (uniform luminance) bars. 3. Many cells showed direction selectivity that was similar for both texture bars and solid bars. However, on average, the direction selectivity measured when texture bars were used was significantly smaller than that for solid bars, and many cells lost significant direction selectivity altogether. The reduction in direction selectivity for texture bars generally reflected a combination of decreased responsiveness in the preferred direction and increased responsiveness in the null (opposite to preferred) direction. 4. Responses to a texture bar in the absence of a texture background (”texture bar alone”) were very similar to the responses to solid bars both in the magnitude of response and in the degree of direction selectivity. Conversely, adding a static texture surround to a moving solid bar reduced direction selectivity on average without a reduction in response magnitude. These results indicate that the static surround is largely responsible for the differences in direction selectivity for texture bars versus solid bars. 5. In the majority of MT cells studied, responses to a moving texture bar were largely independent of whether the elements in the bar were of the same orientation as the background elements or of the orthogonal orientation. Thus, for the class of stimuli we used, orientation contrast does not markedly affect the responses of MT neurons to moving texture patterns. 6. The optimum figure length and the shapes of the length tuning curves determined with the use of solid bars and texture bars differed significantly in most of the cells examined. Thus neurons in MT are not simply selective for a particular figure shape independent of whatever cues are used to delineate the figure.},

Here we show that a similar normalization occurs during olfactory processing in the Drosophila antennal lobe. We exploit the orderly anatomy of this circuit to independently manipulate feedforward and lateral input to second-order projection neurons (PNs). Lateral inhibition increases the level of feedforward input needed to drive PNs to saturation, and this normalization scales with the total activity of the olfactory receptor neuron (ORN) population. Increasing total ORN activity also makes PN responses more transient. Strikingly, a model with just two variables (feedforward and total ORN activity) accurately predicts PN odor responses. Finally, we show that discrimination by a linear decoder is facilitated by two complementary transformations: the saturating transformation intrinsic to each processing channel boosts weak signals, while normalization helps equalize responses to different stimuli.},

In this paper, we review and discuss these observations and results in a number of different contexts and applications. Specifically, the intelligibility of phase-only reconstruction for images, speech, and crystallographic structures are illustrated. Several approaches to justifying the relative importance of phase through statistical arguments are presented, along with a number of informal arguments suggesting reasons for the importance of phase. Specific conditions under which a sequence can be exactly reconstructed from phase are reviewed, both for one-dimensional and multi-dimensional sequences, and algorithms for both approximate and exact reconstruction of signals from phase information are presented. A number of applications of the observations and results in this paper are suggested.},

year = {1999}, 
abstract = {It is not clear how information related to cognitive or psychological processes is carried by or represented in the responses of single neurons. One provocative proposal is that precisely timed spike patterns play a role in carrying such information. This would require that these spike patterns have the potential for carrying information that would not be available from other measures such as spike count or latency. We examined exactly timed (1-ms precision) triplets and quadruplets of spikes in the stimulus-elicited responses of lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and primary visual cortex (V1) neurons of the awake fixating rhesus monkey. Large numbers of these precisely timed spike patterns were found. Information theoretical analysis showed that the precisely timed spike patterns carried only information already available from spike count, suggesting that the number of precisely timed spike patterns was related to firing rate. We therefore examined statistical models relating precisely timed spike patterns to response strength. Previous statistical models use observed properties of neuronal responses such as the peristimulus time histogram, interspike interval, and/or spike count distributions to constrain the parameters of the model. We examined a new stochastic model, which unlike previous models included all three of these constraints and unlike previous models predicted the numbers and types of observed precisely timed spike patterns. This shows that the precise temporal structures of stimulus-elicited responses in LGN and V1 can occur by chance. We show that any deviation of the spike count distribution, no matter how small, from a Poisson distribution necessarily changes the number of precisely timed spike patterns expected in neural responses. Overall the results indicate that the fine temporal structure of responses can only be interpreted once all the coarse temporal statistics of neural responses have been taken into account.},

The optimal velocities of the main responses to a moving light bar, representing center responses (i.e., due to entering the ON center or leaving the OFF center) were significantly lower for X-cells than for Y-cells. The velocity upper cutoffs were significantly higher for Y-cells than for X-cells, whereas responses to slow movement were significantly stronger in X-cells than in Y-cells. The velocity range over which secondary responses were found was significantly lower for X-cells than for Y-cells. The velocity characteristics of LGN cells were compared with those measured under precisely the same experimental conditions in areas 17 and 18. Overall, the LGN cells were sensitive to much faster velocities than cortical cells. The differences between these cortical areas were found to be much larger than the differences in velocity selectivity observed in the LGN between X- and Y-cells or within the X and Y classes. In particular, the ubiquitous presence of cells responding only to very low velocities (less than 10 degrees/s) in area 17 subserving central vision cannot directly reflect LGN velocity selectivity, since such extreme preference for low velocities was not found in the LGN sample. Changes in eccentricity had much less effect on the velocity characteristics in the LGN than in the cortex. The latency of responses to a moving light bar as estimated using a spatial lag-velocity method was on average 46 and 37 ms for X-ON and Y-ON cells as opposed to 75 and 68 ms for X-OFF and Y-OFF cells, respectively. These latencies were slightly shorter than the ON and OFF latencies (time to peak) measured with stationary presentations of the same light bar (averages 61 and 53 ms for X-ON and Y-ON, 113 and 93 ms for X-OFF and Y-OFF). For a moving dark bar the average latency was 35 and 29 ms for X-OFF and Y-OFF cells, respectively, whereas it was 47 and 54 ms for X-ON and Y-ON cells. There were no significant differences in response strength between ON and OFF cells nor between X- and Y-cells. Many Y-OFF cells had nonlinear spatial lag-velocity relationships. This indicates a shift in response origin from distal to more proximal parts of the receptive field when going from low to high velocities.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {The influence of a moving textured background on direction selectivity for a moving bar was tested in 118 striate neurons and in 19 dorsal lateral geniculate neurons of anesthetized and paralyzed cats. In the standard conditions the background was a two-dimensional noise pattern, the bar moved at optimal speed, and its contrast was adjusted to the level producing 50% of the maximum response. These experiments revealed a new typology of cortical cells based on relative direction selectivity. Six different relative-direction-selectivity types are described. Two types of cells were found to have opposite kinds of relative direction selectivity: antiphase direction-selective cells (5% of the cortical sample) preferred the direction of the bar opposite to the direction of background motion, and absolutely direction-selective cells (20% of the cortical sample) kept their direction selectivity for bar motion independently of the background motion. Three types of cortical cells were direction selective for bar motion only in restricted background motion conditions: conditionally direction-selective cells (20% of cortical sample) only expressed their direction selectivity when the bar and the background moved in antiphase, differencing direction-selective cells (5% of the cortical sample) only expressed their direction selectivity when the bar and the background differed in speed, and limited direction-selective cells (20% of the cortical sample) only expressed their direction selectivity for near zero background speeds. The sixth type, relative nondirection-selective cells (30% of the cortical sample and all of the geniculate cells) were direction selective for none of the background motion conditions. These different relative-direction-selectivity types differed in RF organization, in ocular dominance, velocity sensitivity, in laminar distribution, and in distribution in the visual field. The relative-direction-selectivity types were invariant for changes in the contrast and bar speed. The construction of these relative-direction-selectivity types from the geniculate input requires some inhibitory, but mainly facilitatory, intracortical interactions. These experimental findings suggest that area 17 in the cat has the neuronal machinery to extract depth from motion (limited direction-selective cells) and to segregate visual scenes by motion cues (antiphase, conditionally and differencing direction-selective cells).},

abstract = {We have used a combination of theory and experiment to assess how information is represented in a realistic cortical population response, examining how motion direction and timing is encoded in groups of neurons in cortical area MT. Combining data from several single-unit experiments, we constructed model population responses in small time windows and represented the response in each window as a binary vector of 1s or 0s signifying spikes or no spikes from each cell. We found that patterns of spikes and silence across a population of nominally redundant neurons can carry up to twice as much information about visual motion than does population spike count, even when the neurons respond independently to their sensory inputs. This extra information arises by virtue of the broad diversity of firing rate dynamics found in even very similarly tuned groups of MT neurons. Additionally, specific patterns of spiking and silence can carry more information than the sum of their parts (synergy), opening up the possibility for combinatorial coding in cortex. These results also held for populations in which we imposed levels of nonindependence (correlation) comparable to those found in cortical recordings. Our findings suggest that combinatorial codes are advantageous for representing stimulus information on short time scales, even when neurons have no complicated, stimulus-dependent correlation structure.},

The authors investigated this process in anesthetized, paralyzed cats by recording from LGN relay neurons, together with their retinal input, which appeared as slow (S) potentials. The major findings are: (1) The transfer ratio (LGN firing/retinal firing) fluctuated slowly and (2) these fluctuations in transfer ratio were synchronized across the nucleus, did not depend on visual stimulation, and were highly correlated with neural activity in the parabrachial nucleus of the brainstem (PBN). Electrical stimulation of the PBN increased transmission from retina to cortex through the LGN. It is concluded that the PBN, which is part of the Ascending Arousal System, can modulate globally the transmission of information through the thalamus.},

abstract = {Visual neurons are often characterized in terms of their tuning for various stimulus properties, such as shape, color, and velocity. Generally, these tuning curves are further modulated by the overall intensity of the stimulus, such that increasing the contrast increases the firing rate, up to some maximum. In this paper, we describe the tuning of neurons in the middle temporal area (MT or V5) of macaque visual cortex for moving stimuli of varying contrast. We find that, for some MT neurons, tuning curves for stimulus direction, speed, and size are shaped in part by suppressive influences that are present at high stimulus contrast but weak or nonexistent at low contrast. For most neurons, the suppression is direction-specific and strongest for large, slow-moving stimuli. The surprising consequence of this phenomenon is that some MT neurons actually fire more vigorously to a large low-contrast stimulus than to one of high contrast. These results are consistent with recent perceptual observations, as well as with information-theoretic models, which hypothesize that the visual system seeks to reduce redundancy at high contrast while maintaining sensitivity at low contrast.},

Selectivity for motion is first found in individual neurons in the primate visual cortex (V1), in which many simple cells respond selectively to the direction and speed of moving stimuli. Beyond simple cells, most studies of direction selectivity have focused on either V1 complex cells or neurons in the middle temporal area (MT/V5). To understand how visual information is transferred along this pathway, we have studied all three types of neurons, using a reverse correlation procedure to obtain high spatial and temporal resolution maps of activity for different motion stimuli. Most complex and MT cells showed strong second-order interactions, indicating that they were tuned for particular displacements of an apparent motion stimulus. The spatiotemporal structure of these interactions showed a high degree of similarity between the populations of V1 complex cells and MT cells, in terms of the spatiotemporal limits and preferences for motion and their two-dimensional spatial structure. Much of the structure in the V1 and MT second-order kernels could be accounted for on the basis of the first-order responses of V1 simple cells, under the assumption of a Reichardt or motion-energy type of computation.},

In the domain of visual motion processing, the response to a stimulus presented to a neuron’s classical receptive field can be modulated by presenting stimuli to its surround. The nature of these center-surround interactions is often inhibitory; the neural response decreases when the same direction of motion is presented to center and surround. Here we use binocular rivalry as a tool to study center-surround interactions. We show that magnitude of surround suppression varies as a function of luminance contrast and surround width. Increasing the size of surround motion increased surround suppression at high contrast. Furthermore, large, high-contrast surrounds facilitated opposite-direction motion in the center. For stimuli presented at low contrast, surround suppression peaked at a smaller surround width. In addition, we provide evidence that surround inhibition occurs at multiple levels of visual processing: Surround inhibition in motion processing is likely to originate from both monocular and binocular processing stages.},

A key prediction of the theory is that the centers of iso-orientation domains must be arranged in a hexagonal lattice on the cortical surface. Here we show that such a pattern is observed in individuals of four different species: monkeys, cats, tree shrews and ferrets. The proposed mechanism explains how orientation maps can develop without requiring precise patterns of spontaneous activity or molecular guidance. Further, it offers a possible account for the emergence of orientation tuning in single neurons despite the absence of orderly orientation maps in rodents species.},

To elucidate potential top-down mechanisms that govern TCL processing in awake, behaving animals, we simultaneously recorded neuronal ensemble activity across multiple cortical and thalamic areas while rats performed an active aperture discrimination task. Single neurons located in the primary somatosensory cortex (S1), the ventroposterior medial, and the posterior medial thalamic nuclei of the trigeminal somatosensory pathways exhibited prominent anticipatory firing modulations before the whiskers touching the aperture edges. This cortical and thalamic anticipatory firing could not be explained by whisker movements or whisker stimulation, because neither trigeminal ganglion sensory-evoked responses nor EMG activity were detected during the same period. Both thalamic and S1 anticipatory activity were predictive of the animal’s discrimination accuracy. Inactivation of the primary motor cortex (M1) with muscimol affected anticipatory patterns in S1 and the thalamus, and impaired the ability to predict the animal’s performance accuracy based on thalamocortical anticipatory activity. These findings suggest that neural processing in TCLs is launched in anticipation of whisker contact with objects, depends on top-down effects generated in part by M1 activity, and cannot be explained by the classical feedforward model of the rat trigeminal system.},

Specifically, we used fMRI to investigate whether the representational content of prestimulus activity in early visual cortex is linked to subsequent perception during a challenging detection task. Human participants were asked to detect oriented gratings of a particular orientation that were embedded in noise. We found two characteristics of prestimulus activity that predisposed participants to hallucinations: overall lower prestimulus activity and a bias in the prestimulus activity patterns toward the to-be-detected (expected) grating. These results suggest that perceptual hallucinations may be due to an imprecise and biased state of sensory circuits preceding sensory evidence collection.

abstract = {The origin of orientation selectivity in primary visual cortex (V1) is a model problem for understanding cerebral cortical circuitry. A key constraint is that orientation tuning width is invariant under changes in stimulus contrast. We have previously shown that this can arise from the combination of feedforward LGN input and an orientation-untuned component of feedforward inhibition that dominates excitation. However, these models did not include the large background voltage noise observed in vivo. Here, we include this noise and examine a simple model of cat V1 response. Constraining our simulations to fit physiological data, our single model parameter is the strength of feedforward inhibition relative to LGN excitation. With physiological noise, the contrast-invariance of orientation tuning depends little on inhibition level, although very weak or very strong inhibition lead to weak broadening or sharpening, respectively of tuning with contrast. For any inhibition level the circular variance decreases with contrast as observed experimentally. These results arise primarily because the voltage noise causes large inputs to be much more strongly amplified than small ones in evoking spiking responses. However, inhibition comparable to or stronger than excitation appears necessary to suppress spiking responses to non-preferred orientations to the extent seen in vivo and to allow the emergence of a tuned mean voltage response. These two response properties provide the strongest constraints on model details. Antiphase inhibition from inhibitory simple cells, and not just untuned inhibition from inhibitory complex cells, appears necessary to fully explain these aspects of cortical orientation tuning.},

Previous electrophysiological single-cell recordings demonstrate that a subgroup of cells in macaque V1 and V2 signal the presence of illusory contours, whereas recent human brain imaging studies reveal higher-order visual cortices playing a central role in illusory figure processing. It seems that the processing of illusory contours/figures may engage multiple cortical interactions between hierarchically organized processing stages in the ventral visual pathway of primates. However, it is not yet known in which brain areas illusory contours are represented in the same manner as real contours at both the population and single-cell levels. Here, by combining intrinsic optical imaging in anesthetized rhesus macaques with single-cell recordings in awake ones, we found a complete overlap of orientation domains in visual cortical area V4 for processing real and illusory contours. In contrast, the orientation domains mapped in early visual areas V1 and V2 mainly encoded the local physical stimulus features inducing the subjective perception of global illusory contours. Our results indicate that real and illusory contours are encoded equivalently by the same functional domains in V4, suggesting that V4 is a key cortical locus for integration of local features into global contours.},

The main difficulty in its practical application to spike train analysis is that estimates of neuronal information from experimental data are prone to a systematic error (called “bias”). This bias is an inevitable consequence of the limited number of stimulus-response samples that it is possible to record in a real experiment. In this paper, we first explain the origin and the implications of the bias problem in spike train analysis. We then review and evaluate some recent general-purpose methods to correct for sampling bias: the Panzeri-Treves, Quadratic Extrapolation, Best Universal Bound, Nemenman-Shafee-Bialek procedures, and a recently proposed Shuffling bias reduction procedure. Finally, we make practical recommendations for the accurate computation of information from spike trains. Our main recommendation is to estimate information using the Shuffling bias reduction procedure in combination with one of the other four general purpose bias reduction procedures mentioned above. This provides information estimates with acceptable variance and which are unbiased even when the number of trials per stimulus is as small as the number of possible discrete neuronal responses.},

These intralaminar interneurons possess unique electrophysiological characteristics, including (1) action potentials of a short duration (average width at half amplitude of 0.34 ms). (2) the ability to generate high-frequency trains of action potentials exceeding 500 Hz, without strong spike frequency adaptation, and (3) a low-threshold regenerative response with variable magnitude of expression, ranging from a subthreshold depolarization towards the generation of one to several action potentials in different cells. The low-threshold regenerative depolarization following a hyperpolarizing current pulse was increased in size by application of 4-aminopyridine, was reduced by nickel, and was not influenced by extracellular cesium. These findings indicate that this event is mediated by an underlying Ca(2+)-dependent mechanism, such as a low-threshold Ca(2+) current, that is regulated by the activation of opposing transient K+ currents. Every interneuron tested responded to glutamate, kainate, quisqualate, or N-methyl-D-aspartate with depolarization and action potential discharge. In contrast, we did not observe a postsynaptic response to activation of the metabotropic receptors with 1S,3R-(+/-)-1-amino-cyclopentane-1,3-dicarboxylate. Application of gamma-amino-butyric acid (GABA) strongly inhibited spike firing through a biphasic hyperpolarization and increase in membrane conductance, a response that reversed close to the presumed chloride equilibrium potential and was imitated by the GABAA receptor agonist muscimol. The GABAB receptor agonist baclofen evoked only a weak membrane hyperpolarization from rest and suppression of spontaneous spike activity. Application of acetylcholine, or the muscarinic agonist acetyl-beta-methylcholine, inhibited spontaneous action potential activity through hyperpolarization of the membrane potential, presumably resulting from an increase in membrane potassium conductance. In contrast, application of serotonin only slightly facilitated tonic activity in a subpopulation of interneurons, histamine induced a small slow depolarization apparently through activation of presynaptic excitatory pathways, and noradrenaline and adenosine had no detectable effect on the spontaneous firing or resting potential of interneurons. We suggest that intralaminar interneurons may function in a relatively linear manner to transform retinal and cortical inputs into a local field of inhibition in the dorsal lateral geniculate and that the excitability of these neurons is largely controlled by retinal, cortical, GABAergic, and cholinergic (brainstem) afferents.},

It is then assumed that the perceived orientation of visual contours is determined by the pattern of neuronal activity across orientation columns. Using statistical estimation theory, limits on the precision of orientation estimation and discrimination are calculated. These limits are functions of single unit response properties such as orientation tuning width, response amplitude and response variability, as well as the degree of organization in the neural network. It is shown that a network of modest size, consisting of broadly orientation selective units, can reliably discriminate orientation with a precision equivalent to human performance. Of the various network parameters, the discrimination threshold depends most critically on the number of cells in the hypercolumn. The form of the dependence on cell number correctly predicts the results of psychophysical studies of orientation discrimination. The model system’s performance is also consistent with psychophysical data in two situations in which human performance is not optimal. First, interference with orientation discrimination occurs when multiple stimuli activate cells in the same hypercolumn. Second, systematic errors in the estimation of orientation can occur when a stimulus is composed of intersecting lines. The results demonstrate that it is possible to relate neural activity to visual performance by an examination of the pattern of activity across orientation columns. This provides support for the hypothesis that perceived orientation is determined by the distributed pattern of neural activity. The results also encourage the view that limits on visual discrimination are determined by the responses of many neurons rather than the sensitivity of individual cells.},

Illusions of duration distortion beg an important question of time representation: when durations dilate or contract, does time in general slow down or speed up during that moment? In other words, what entailments do duration distortions have with respect to other timing judgments? We here show that when a sound or visual flicker is presented in conjunction with an unexpected visual stimulus, neither the pitch of the sound nor the frequency of the flicker is affected by the apparent duration dilation. This demonstrates that subjective time in general is not slowed; instead, duration judgments can be manipulated with no concurrent impact on other temporal judgments. Like spatial vision, time perception appears to be underpinned by a collaboration of separate neural mechanisms that usually work in concert but are separable. We further show that the duration dilation of an unexpected stimulus is not enhanced by increasing its saliency, suggesting that the effect is more closely related to prediction violation than enhanced attention. Finally, duration distortions induced by violations of progressive number sequences implicate the involvement of high-level predictability, suggesting the involvement of areas higher than primary visual cortex. We suggest that duration distortions can be understood in terms of repetition suppression, in which neural responses to repeated stimuli are diminished.},

Here we show that despite their inability to report the orientation of an individual patch, observers can reliably estimate the average orientation, demonstrating that the local orientation signals are combined rather than lost. Our results imply that crowding is distinct from ordinary masking, and is perhaps related to texture perception. Under crowded conditions, the orientation signals in primary visual cortex are pooled before they reach consciousness},

abstract = {The output of retinal ganglion cells depends on local and global aspects of the visual scene. The local receptive field is well studied and classically consists of a linear excitatory center and a linear antagonistic surround. The global receptive field contains pools of nonlinear subunits that are distributed widely across the retina. The subunit pools mediate in uncertain ways various nonlinear behaviors of ganglion cells, like temporal-frequency doubling, saccadic suppression, and contrast adaptation. To clarify mechanisms of subunit function, we systematically examined the effect of remote grating patterns on the spike activity of cat X- and Y-type ganglion cells in vivo. We present evidence for two distinct subunit types based on spatiotemporal relationships between response nonlinearities elicited by remote drifting and contrast-reversing gratings. One subunit type is excitatory and activated by gratings of approximately 0.1 cycles per degree, while the other is inhibitory and activated by gratings of approximately 1 cycle per degree. The two subunit pools contribute to a global gain control mechanism that differentially modulates ganglion cell response dynamics, particularly for ON-center cells, where excitatory and inhibitory subunit stimulation respectively makes responses to antipreferred and preferred contrast steps more transient. We show that the excitatory subunits also have a profound influence on spatial tuning, turning cells from lowpass into bandpass filters. Based on difference-of-Gaussians model fits to tuning curves, we attribute the increased bandpass selectivity to changes in center-surround strength and relative phase and not center-surround size. A conceptual model of the extraclassical receptive field that could explain many observed phenomena is discussed.},

In most model systems, little is known about the transformation of visual information as it occurs along visual pathways. We examined how visual information is transformed physiologically as it is communicated from the eye to higher-order brain centers using bumblebees, which are known for their visual capabilities. We recorded intracellularly in vivo from 30 neurons in the central bumblebee brain (the lateral protocerebrum) and compared these neurons to 132 neurons from more distal areas along the visual pathway, namely the medulla and the lobula. In these three brain regions (medulla, lobula, and central brain), we examined correlations between the neurons’ branching patterns and their responses primarily to color, but also to motion stimuli. Visual neurons projecting to the anterior central brain were generally color sensitive, while neurons projecting to the posterior central brain were predominantly motion sensitive. The temporal response properties differed significantly between these areas, with an increase in spike time precision across trials and a decrease in average reliable spiking as visual information processing progressed from the periphery to the central brain. These data suggest that neurons along the visual pathway to the central brain not only are segregated with regard to the physical features of the stimuli (e.g., color and motion), but also differ in the way they encode stimuli, possibly to allow for efficient parallel processing to occur.},

Cortical input to sensory thalamus is thought to mainly evoke feed-forward synaptic inhibition of thalamocortical (TC) cells via reticular thalamic nucleus (nRT) neurons, especially during oscillations. This relies on a stronger synaptic strength in the cortico-nRT pathway than in the cortico-TC pathway, allowing the feed-forward inhibition of TC cells to overcome direct cortico-TC excitation. We found a systemic and specific reduction in strength in GluA4-deficient (Gria4(-/-)) mice of one excitatory synapse of the rhythmogenic cortico-thalamo-cortical system, the cortico-nRT projection, and observed that the oscillations could still be initiated by cortical inputs via the cortico-TC-nRT-TC pathway. These results reveal a previously unknown mode of cortico-thalamo-cortical transmission, bypassing direct cortico-nRT excitation, and describe a mechanism for pathological oscillation generation. This mode could be active under other circumstances, representing a previously unknown channel of cortico-thalamo-cortical information processing.},

Here, in historical context, we describe recent evidence that humans do not always rely on propositional internal representations but, instead, can also rely on at least one other format: depictive representation. We propose that the debate should now move on to characterizing all of the different forms of human mental representation.},

Here, we present evidence that this applies also to visual features that do not cross yet but might cross the VM in the future. During reversible deactivation of the contralateral visual cortex in cats, we observed that ipsilaterally recorded neurons close to the border between areas 17 and 18 receive selective excitatory callosal input on both ongoing and evoked activity. In detail, neurons responding well to a vertical Gabor patch moving away from the deactivated hemifield decreased prestimulus and stimulus-driven activity much more than those preferring motion toward the cooled hemifield. Further, activity of neurons responding to horizontal lines decreased more than the response to vertical lines. Embedding a single Gabor into a collinear line context selectively stabilized responses, especially when the context was limited to the intact hemifield. These findings indicate that CCs interconnect not only neurons coding for similar orientations but also for similar directions of motion. We conclude that CCs anticipate stimulus features that are potentially relevant for both hemifields (i.e., coherent motion but also collinear shape) because already prestimulus activity and activity to stimuli not crossing the VM revealed feature specificity. Finally, we hypothesize that intrinsic and callosal networks processing different orientations and directions are anisotropic close to the VM facilitating perceptual grouping along likely future motion or (shape) trajectories before the visual stimulus arrives.},

We then focus on (c) the comparison of perception and cell responses to images of faces presented in sequences of unrelated images. Specifically the paper concerns the cell function and perception in circumstances where meaningful patterns occur momentarily in the context of a naturally or unnaturally changing visual environment. Experience of visual sequences allows anticipation, yet one sensory stimulus also “masks” perception and neural processing of subsequent stimuli. To understand this paradox we compared cell responses in monkey temporal cortex to body images presented individually, in pairs and in action sequences. Responses to one image suppressed responses to similar images for approximately 500 ms. This suppression led to responses peaking 100 ms earlier to image sequences than to isolated images (e.g., during head rotation, face-selective activity peaks before the face confronts the observer). Thus forward masking has unrecognized benefits for perception because it can transform neuronal activity to make it predictive during natural change.},

When measured in spatiotemporal frequency space, such MT spectral receptive field (SRF) properties are closely matched to the spectrum generated by a moving edge. In contrast, V1 neurons have SRF properties that are poorly matched to moving edge spectra, indicating that V1 neurons are not tuned to a particular image speed but rather to specific spatial and temporal frequencies. Here we describe a neural mechanism based directly on the properties of V1 neurons that is able to explain the SRF change that occurs between V1 and MT. We outline the theory behind this transformation and posit an explanation for how the visual system extracts true speed (independent of spatial frequency) from retinal image motion. We tested this speed model against our MT neuron data and found that it provides an excellent account of speed tuning in MT.},

abstract = {Horseradish peroxidase was deposited in the optic nerve to retrogradely label and reveal the dendritic form of all classes of ganglion cell, or it was injected into the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus to reveal only those classes projecting to the thalamus. The results were compared with those of the accompanying paper in which the ganglion cells projecting to the midbrain are selectively revealed. Two major classes of ganglion cells are described, the P alpha and P beta cells. For both classes dendritic field size increases with eccentricity from the fovea and there is no overlap in the two classes at any given eccentricity. Cell body size shows a similar mean difference but with a slight overlap. Both cell bodies and dendritic fields are larger along the temporal horizontal meridian than the nasal horizontal meridian, for P alpha and for P beta cells, but these differences are reduced when naso-temporal differences in ganglion cell density are taken into account, that is, size correlates closely with density. Injections restricted to the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus labelled almost exclusively P beta cells, whereas injections confined to the magnocellular layers labelled almost exclusively P alpha cells. As midbrain injections label no P beta cells and few P alpha cells it can be shown that about 80% of ganglion cells are P beta cells projecting to parvocellular lateral geniculate nucleus, and that about 10% are P alpha cells projecting to magnocellular layers. The coverage factor, that is the number of cells covering each point on the retina, varied from 1.9-2.3 for P beta cells, and from 2-7 for P alpha cells. Comparing the results with those of comparable investigations on cats and rabbits shows a much clearer segregation of the terminal targets of different classes of ganglion cell in monkeys, the greatest difference being the absence in the monkey of a projection to the geniculate from gamma- and epsilon-like cells. Further, axons which branch and innervate both thalamus and midbrain are rare in monkeys but common in other mammals. Comparing the results with those from physiological investigations suggests that the P beta cells correspond to colour-opponent cells, whereas P alpha cells correspond to the achromatic broad-band magnocellular cells.},

title = {Recurrent Feedback Loops in Associative Learning}, 
journal = {Neuron}, 
volume = {89}, 
number = {3}, 
pages = {427–430}, 
year = {2016}, 
abstract = {The brain, like other computational devices, often uses feedback to fine-tune and optimize its computations. For example, iterative computational circuits frequently sample their own output to estimate error in their intended outcome and use this information to improve their computational accuracy in the next iteration. In addition to the traditional global feedback loop that originates from the final output of the circuit, local feedback loops also offer computational benefits. Consider, for example, a computational device made of a number of discrete operational stages, each of which transforms the information it receives to generate its own output. In such a case, local feedback loops, embedded in each operational stage, offer tremendous flexibility and specificity for modulation of the overall computational capacity and accuracy of the device. In many cases, local feedback mechanisms are indispensable for circuit optimization, for example, when the computation performed at each stage is not linear, or when additional (external) inputs are incorporated at each operational stage. In addition to providing a mechanism for error minimization, feedback can also be used to alter the gain of a circuit, or as a plasticity mechanism for learning.

In artificial computational devices, feedback mechanisms work at both the local and global level. It is therefore no surprise that in the brain, where computations occur at many different scales, feedback loops appear to be used at almost every level: within single neurons, within cortical layers, between cortical layers, and between cortex and subcortical structures. In this issue of Neuron, Gao et al. (2016) use the many advantages of cerebellum as a circuit ideally suited for reverse engineering the brain (Khodakhah, 2015) to examine the properties and function of a local feedback loop from the cerebellar nuclei to the cerebellar cortex and provide convincing evidence for the role of this feedback loop for motor learning in associative conditioning.

To appreciate the contribution of Gao et al. (2016), it would be helpful to consider the overall design of the cerebellum (Figure 1): the cerebellum is an evolutionarily conserved, layered structure emerging from the hindbrain that is critical for refining motor control, motor learning, and analogous cognitive sharpening. The input layer, the granule cell layer, houses half the neurons in the brain, with each granule cell receiving just four or so mossy fiber inputs. Granule cells project into the superficial molecular layer where they branch to form parallel fibers, which innervate the spectacular dendrites of Purkinje cells, along with a smattering of molecular layer inhibitory interneurons (MLIs), and apical dendrites of inhibitory interneurons of the granule cell layer, Golgi cells. Purkinje neurons also receive olivary climbing fiber inputs that wrap around the dendrites like a vine and trigger associative plasticity of parallel fiber inputs onto Purkinje cells. Purkinje neurons in turn project to and inhibit the cerebellar nuclei, which form the sole output of most of the cerebellum. By in large, this circuit is feedforward, which makes the long-known (Houck and Person, 2014) but little-studied feedback pathway from the cerebellar nuclei to the cerebellar cortex so tantalizing: how is this local feedback used in motor learning and cerebellar computation?

To address this question, Gao et al. (2016) use optogenetics to selectively manipulate activity in this pathway during a cerebellar-dependent learning task. Delay eyeblink conditioning is a cerebellar-dependent form of classical conditioning that exploits the ability of the circuit to associate arbitrary stimuli to generate a conditioned motor output. In the first part of their study, Gao et al. (2016) examine structural plasticity in nucleocortical pathway during motor learning. They corroborated recent work showing that the nucleocortical pathway innervates part of the cerebellar cortex involved in eyeblink conditioning (Houck and Person, 2015) and then go on to explore whether nucleocortical filopodia show structural plasticity during eyeblink conditioning as they have been shown to do with rotarod training (Ruediger et al., 2011). Indeed, comparing nucleocortical terminals in naive and trained mice revealed dramatic structural plasticity, with a nearly 70% increase in the number of filopodial extensions.

The structural plasticity observed in this population of mossy fibers raises many important questions. Among the most important are the implications for the combinatorial pattern recognition of granule cells. A foundation of cerebellar theory revolves around the idea that granule cells respond to coincident inputs from diverse mossy fiber sources, which converge onto sparse granule cell dendrites. This convergence is hypothesized to produce an expansion recoding by the granule cell layer that could be used by Purkinje neurons in pattern recognition (Marr, 1969 and Albus, 1971). The combinatorial expansion theorized to be produced by granule cells could be modulated if mossy fiber filopodia extend to integrate with granule cells that receive other sources of information: if mossy fiber filopodia sprout to invade sensory glomeruli contacting granule cells, for example, combinatorial expansion may transform, as would receptive field properties of granule cells and their overlying Purkinje neurons.

In addition to the coding implications of feedback mossy fiber sprouting, questions arise around the molecular underpinnings of the expansion. What drives filopodial outgrowth upon learning, and are the changes stable or transient? Regardless of the specific dynamics of mature mossy fiber filopodia, identifying the molecular drivers of this structural plasticity will be essential to fully understand cerebellar learning processes. One clue could come from cerebellar development studies. Cerebellar mossy fiber filopodial plasticity is seen during development and is regulated by BMP4 signaling (Kalinovsky et al., 2011). Future studies are thus poised to investigate whether these developmental mechanisms are preserved in adults during periods of learning and, if so, how those processes are engaged.

It is interesting to note that filopodial extensions of other cerebellar mossy fiber sources targeting Lobules 5 and 9 sprout during cerebellar-dependent motor learning of a rotarod task (Ruediger et al., 2011). In the same study, it was noted that hippocampal mossy fibers also sprout filopodia during hippocampal-dependent learning, suggesting common mechanisms and computational principles associated with structural plasticity. There it was found that filopodia preferentially targeted inhibitory interneurons, which was not seen in the current study. The present observation of filopodial contacts onto granule cells is therefore novel and suggests that filopodial recruitment of feedforward inhibition through Golgi cells is not the whole story.

To look at how motor learning affects the inhibitory/excitatory (I/E) balance in Purkinje cells, Gao et al. (2016) examined feedforward inhibition into Purkinje cells and found a very intriguing pattern of Purkinje cell inhibition. Whereas before learning nucleocortical activation drove slightly more inhibition than excitation in Purkinje cells (I > E), after eyeblink condition the I/E difference was steeper, with a greater degree of inhibition onto Purkinje neurons. The pattern of high I/E ratio elicited by nucleocortical activation was in stark contrast to the pattern seen with electrical (i.e., nonspecific) mossy fiber activation, which evoked about half as much inhibition as excitation under basal conditions. Feedforward inhibition onto Purkinje neurons is presumably via granule cells driving MLI inhibition of Purkinje neurons. As such, the learning-related change in inhibition onto Purkinje cells points to yet another mechanism of cerebellar plasticity: that of increasing feedforward inhibition onto Purkinje cells by specific mossy fiber afferents.

The finding of altered I/E balance after learning is an exciting advance given the degree of debate in the field about the significance of traditional “cerebellar LTD” mechanisms in learning. While pauses develop in Purkinje neurons during acquisition of conditioned eyeblink responses, disinhibiting downstream nuclear neurons that drive eyelid closure, the mechanistic underpinnings of these pauses are under intense scrutiny. While there is not enough room to review the debate here, the finding that inhibition is plastic onto Purkinje neurons, even if the increase is owed to polysynaptic changes upstream, could complement concomitant changes in excitation or operate in a parallel manner to other synaptic changes underlying learned responses.

The final set of experiments reported here go on to show the functional role of nucleocortical feedback in delay eyelid conditioning. Optogenetic stimulation of the nucleocortical mossy fibers before conditioned responses are learned elicits no eyelid closure, but activation after learning enhances the amplitude and shortens the latency of the conditioned response. Conversely, optogenetic silencing of the nucleocortical pathway delays and truncates learned eyelid closures.

To make sense of these data, it is important to consider that the nucleocortical mossy fiber pathway is comprised of axon collaterals of cerebellar output neurons. As such, they send copies of motor-related signals to the cerebellar cortex (Houck and Person, 2015, Tolbert et al., 1978 and Gao et al., 2016). What makes this pathway enticing to study in the context of eyeblink conditioning is that we know how the activity patterns of these neurons change during learning. Before a conditioned response is learned, nuclear neuron firing rate is relatively unmodulated by the conditioning stimulus. After the CR is learned, however, nuclear neurons increase their firing rates to drive anticipatory eyelid closure. Thus, the content of the feedback information sent to the cortex is changing—increasing—with training, indicative of a positive feedback loop. Therefore, both physiological and structural changes occur during learning. Since optogenetic activation of the pathway only shows effects after learning, it points to the structural plasticity rather than the activity changes alone, as critical for altering the gain of other sensory inputs to Purkinje cells.

The findings have implications for the role of this local feedback loop in other cerebellar computations. If this local feedback is used to shape learned movements guided by the cerebellum, then silencing of the feedback nucleocortical branch during other cerebellar-dependent behaviors, such as locomotion (Machado et al., 2015), should alter coordination. The intriguing question is whether such a role could be observed only in newly learned skills, or whether all movements rely on analogous information to appropriately shape motor kinematics. Eyelid conditioning is convenient for its novelty and arbitrariness, since animals will not have naturally paired a tone with a reflex-eliciting stimulus. However, the paradigm is blind to the role of such information in naturally learned and previously integrated sensorimotor mappings. Future experiments would likely address these and related questions.

A question worthy of further scrutiny is whether the nucleocortical feedback loop can be considered to be a corollary discharge pathway. Corollary discharge, or efference copy as it is also known (Sperry, 1950 and von Holst and Mittelstaedt, 1950), has long been hypothesized to play a critical role in motor control and sensory processing throughout the brain (Sommer and Wurtz, 2008). Within the cerebellum, corollary discharge information has been postulated to contribute to kinematic predictions made by Purkinje neurons (Ito, 2006). By bypassing slow sensory reafference in guiding feedforward motor control, copies of motor commands can rapidly provide feedback to enhance motor control. Several features of the nucleocortical pathway make it of particular interest in the context of corollary discharge feedback in motor control. For example, by definition corollary discharge pathways must convey motor command signals. In delay eyelid conditioning, cerebellar nuclear neurons encode the conditioned eyelid closure, thus the nucleocortical pathway could, at least in this context, provide feedback of conditioned motor commands to the cerebellar cortex. However, whether under physiological conditions the nuclei generally encode motor command signals remains to be established.

The experiments presented by Gao et al. (2016) promise to be the tip of the iceberg in what will be a fast-moving field uncovering the specific role of local feedback loops in motor control, sensory processing, and even cognitive function. At long last, opto- and chemogenetic tools allowing for neuronal branch-specific manipulations open up these long-standing questions to experimental investigation. Stay tuned.},

Planning movements to select an alternative involves several areas in frontal and parietal cortex1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 that are anatomically connected into long-range circuits12. These areas must coordinate their activity to select a common movement goal, but how neural circuits make decisions remains poorly understood. Here we simultaneously record from the dorsal premotor area (PMd) in frontal cortex and the parietal reach region (PRR) in parietal cortex to investigate neural circuit mechanisms for decision making. We find that correlations in spike and local field potential (LFP) activity between these areas are greater when monkeys are freely making choices than when they are following instructions. We propose that a decision circuit featuring a sub-population of cells in frontal and parietal cortex may exchange information to coordinate activity between these areas. Cells participating in this decision circuit may influence movement choices by providing a common bias to the selection of movement goals.},

It is found that the convergence of geniculocortical afferents upon any one pyramidal cell module is enormous, since in any one location there is overlap between 360-540 X-axons and 300-540 Y-axons. In total, the X- and Y-axonal arbors provide some 1640 x 10(6) synapses to area 17, which is equivalent to a ratio of 160-200 synapses per layer IV neuron. These values assume that geniculocortical terminals synapse only with the spiny stellate cells of layer IV. The values are reduced to 100-125 per spiny stellate cell when account is taken of the synapses that involve the dendrites that enter layer IV from neurons with cell bodies in other layers. Since each layer IV neuron receives some 2500 asymmetric synapses, this means that only 5% of the total excitatory input to a layer IV neuron seems to be provided by the geniculocortical afferents. Further, if the boutons in the geniculocortical axonal arbors are distributed homogeneously across layer IV, each axon could only provide one synapse to about one in four of the layer IV neurons encompassed by its plexus. It may be, however, that instead of being spread evenly, boutons in individual arbors converge upon individual neurons to supply a number of synapses to them. But even so, it seems unlikely that any individual geniculate axon could dominate the activity of a particular cortical neuron.},

abstract = {An antibody to microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2) has been used to examine the arrangements of neurons in striate cortex of the cat. It is found that the apical dendrites of medium-sized and large pyramidal cells in layer V group together to form clusters that have a center-to-center spacing of about 56 microns. As these clusters ascend, the apical dendrites of pyramidal cells in layer II/III are added to them. The thinner apical dendrites of the smaller pyramidal cells in layer VIa also form groups that are referred to as bundles. These bundles ascend into layer IV independent of the clusters, and their arrangement suggests that the bundles are formed so that the apical dendrites of the layer VIa pyramids can pass between the groups of cell bodies of the layer V neurons. It is proposed that the clusters formed from the apical dendrites of the layer V and layer II/III pyramidal cells represent the axes of vertical modules of pyramidal cells, which represent the basic neuronal aggregates within area 17 of cat visual cortex. And it is suggested that these modules can be recruited in various combinations, most obviously by the excitation provided by the thalamic inputs, to form the functional columns, such as the ones that are concerned with eye preference and orientation. Based upon the distribution of the dendritic clusters, the pyramidal cell modules would have diameters of 56 microns, and since they are considered to extend through the depth of the cortex, each one would contain some 203 neurons. The striate cortex of one hemisphere contains 160,000 of these modules, which is about the same as the number of X-cells projecting to one hemisphere from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus and twice the number of X- or beta-ganglion cells in the retina. The form of the pyramidal cell modules in cat striate cortex is compared to those present in monkey striate cortex, in which the similar modules are about 10 times more numerous, but only 31 microns in diameter (Peters and Sethares, 1991a).},

The data suggest that only 1.3-1.9% of the excitatory, or asymmetric synapses in layer IVC alpha of striate cortex are provided by the neurons of the magnocellular layers of the LGN. This amounts to only 18-40 of the 1000-2100 asymmetric synapses that the average layer IVC alpha neuron receives. The parvicellular afferents to layer IVC beta, on the other hand, provide 3.7-8.7% of the asymmetric synapses formed by the average layer IVC beta neuron, or 37-191 synapses to each neuron. If it is assumed that the boutons in the geniculocortical axonal plexuses are evenly spread, it can be calculated that the input to an individual layer IVC neuron is provided by some 24 axonal plexuses. This is regardless of whether the neuron lies in layer IVC alpha or in IVC beta. This calculation suggests that a single axonal plexus provides not more than one or two of the excitatory synapses received by an individual layer IVC alpha neuron, and between one and eight excitatory synapses for a layer IVC beta neuron. Consequently, it is unlikely that the response properties of a particular cortical neuron are dominated by its input from a single geniculate neuron. Since the geniculocortical input essentially determines the response properties of neurons in layer IV of macaque striate cortex, it is surprising that this input amounts to such a small number of synapses to an individual neuron, although we obtained a somewhat similar result in our earlier quantitative analysis of the geniculate input to the striate cortex of the cat (Peters and Payne, 1993). But it has to be questioned whether the low values obtained are correct. Interestingly, the geniculocortical input to cortex has been largely neglected in favor of analyses of intracortical circuitry, but in view of the basic importance of this afferent input, it is suggested that more quantitative data about it should be generated, so that a better assessment can be made of its extent},

One basic property concerns the sensitivity to direction of a moving stimulus. This direction selectivity (DS) is a fundamental response characteristic of neurons in the visual cortex. We have conducted a neurophysiological study of cells in the visual cortex to determine how DS is affected by changes in stimulus contrast. Previous work shows that a neuron integration time is increased at low contrasts, causing temporal changes of response properties. This leads to the prediction that DS should change with stimulus contrast. However, the change could be in a counterintuitive direction, i.e., DS could increase with reduced contrast. This possibility is of intrinsic interest but it is also of potential relevance to recent behavioral work in which human subjects exhibit increased DS as contrast is reduced. Our neurophysiological results are consistent with this finding, i.e., the degree of DS of cortical neurons is inversely related to stimulus contrast. Temporal phase differences of inputs to cortical cells may account for this result.},

Advancing our understanding of the brain’s internal processing states, however challenging, could lead to breakthroughs in understanding states such as dreaming, consciousness, and mental disorders (1). Computational theories propose that internal models are broadcast throughout the brain, including to sensory areas of the brain (2). Techniques to read out internal mental models will deliver insight into how our brains use beliefs or predictions to “construct” the environment. Internal models in higher brain areas are complex though, creating a paradox that they are difficult to constrain if we want to decipher the brain’s coding of them. However, when internal models are fed back to sensory cortex, we assume that they are translated into sensory predictions that would intuitively have simpler content. In PNAS, Chong et al. (3) provide empirical evidence needed to drive this theory forward. Using brain reading, they show that the brain constructs new plausible predictions of expected sensory input, and that these predictions can be read out in sensory cortex.},

Surface Laplacian method was used to calculate skull-scalp currents corresponding to the measured scalp potentials. This allowed us to identify several distinct foci of skull-scalp currents and to analyse their individual time-courses. Response nonlinearity as a function of the stimulus size increased markedly from the occipital to temporal loci. Similarly, the nonlinearity of reactivations (late evoked response peaks) over the occipital, lateral-occipital, and frontal scalp regions increased with the peak latency. Response laterality (contralateral vs. ipsilateral) was analysed in lateral-occipital and temporal loci. Early lateral-occipital responses were strongly contralateral but the response laterality decreased and then disappeared for later peaks. Responses in temporal loci did not differ significantly between contralateral and ipsilateral stimulation. Overall, the results suggest that feedback from higher-tier visual areas, e.g., those in temporal cortices, may significantly contribute to reactivations in early visual areas.},

Although the frontal eye field cortex (FEF) has been linked to target selection and making saccades, little is known about its role in the control and performance of the sequences of saccades made during self-guided visual search. We recorded from FEF cells while monkeys searched for a target embedded in natural scenes and examined the degree to which cells with visual and visuo-movement activity showed evidence of target selection for future saccades. We found that for about half of these cells, activity during the fixation period between saccades predicted the next saccade in a sequence at an early time that precluded selection based on current visual input to a cell’s response field. In addition to predicting the next saccade, activity during the fixation prior to two successive saccades also predicted the direction and goal of the second saccade in the sequence. We refer to this as advanced predictive activity. Unlike activity indicating the upcoming saccade, advanced predictive activity occurred later in the fixation period, mirroring the order of the saccade sequence itself. The remaining cells without advanced predictive activity did not predict future saccades but reintroduced the signal for the upcoming saccade at an intermediate time in the fixation period. Together these findings suggest that during natural visual search the timing of FEF cell activity is consistent with a role in specifying targets for one or more future saccades in a search sequence.},

The former is more useful for shorter periods of recordings (2-4 months) separated by long intervals and the latter for longer periods of recordings at a time (6-12 months). With both systems, essentially the entire scalp is intact, allowing multi-site recordings from a number of dorsal cortical areas, as well as other areas, simultaneously. These recordings are performed through tiny craniotomies of usually less than 2mm diameter, which are fitted with small plastic cones that serve as guide tubes for the microelectrodes.

abstract = {Random dot motion (RDM) displays have emerged as one of the standard stimulus types employed in psychophysical and physiological studies of motion processing. RDMs are convenient because it is straightforward to manipulate the relative motion energy for a given motion direction in addition to stimulus parameters such as the speed, contrast, duration, density, aperture, etc. However, as widely as RDMs are employed so do they vary in their details of implementation. As a result, it is often difficult to make direct comparisons across studies employing different RDM algorithms and parameters. Here, we systematically measure the ability of human subjects to estimate motion direction for four commonly used RDM algorithms under a range of parameters in order to understand how these different algorithms compare in their perceptibility. We find that parametric and algorithmic differences can produce dramatically different performances. These effects, while surprising, can be understood in relationship to pertinent neurophysiological data regarding spatiotemporal displacement tuning properties of cells in area MT and how the tuning function changes with stimulus contrast and retinal eccentricity. These data help give a baseline by which different RDM algorithms can be compared, demonstrate a need for clearly reporting RDM details in the methods of papers, and also pose new constraints and challenges to models of motion direction processing.},

The purpose of this study was to identify and localize specific muscarinic receptors for acetylcholine in the DLG. Receptors were identified in rat and cat tissue by means of antibodies to muscarinic receptor subtypes, ml-m4. Brain sections were processed immunohistochemically and examined with light and electron microscopy. Rat DLG stained positively with antibodies to the m1, m2,and m3 receptor subtypes but not with antibodies to the m4 receptor subtype. The m1 and m3 antibodies appeared to label somata and dendrites of thalamocortical cells. The m1 immunostaining was pale, whereas m3-positive neurons exhibited denser labeling with focal concentrations of staining. Strong immunoreactivity to the m2 antibody was widespread in dendrites and somata of cells resembling geniculate interneurons. Most m2-positive synaptic contacts were classified as F2-type terminals, which are the presynaptic dendrites of interneurons. The thalamic reticular nucleus also exhibited robust m2 immunostaining. Cat DLG exhibited immunoreactivity to the m2 and m3 antibodies. The entire DLG stained darkly for the m2 receptor subtype, except for patchy label in the medial interlaminar nucleus and the ventralmost C laminae. The staining for m3 was lighter and was distributed more homogeneously across the DLG. The perigeniculate nucleus also was immunoreactive to the m2 and m3 subtype-specific antibodies. Immunoreactivity in cat to the m1 or m4 receptor antibodies was undetectable. These data provide anatomical evidence for specific muscarinic-mediated actions of acetylcholine on DLG thalamocortical cells and thalamic interneurons.},

One particular practice that has become common is ‘reverse inference’, by which the engagement of a particular cognitive process is inferred from the activation of a particular brain region. Such inferences are not deductively valid, but can still provide some information. Using a Bayesian analysis of the BrainMap neuroimaging database, I characterize the amount of additional evidence in favor of the engagement of a cognitive process that can be offered by a reverse inference. Its usefulness is particularly limited by the selectivity of activation in the region of interest. I argue that cognitive neuroscientists should be circumspect in the use of reverse inference, particularly when selectivity of the region in question cannot be established or is known to be weak.},

Images fade and may eventually disappear when the physiological motion of the retinal stimulus is reduced or eliminated. According to a widespread theory, microsaccades are responsible for maintaining visibility during fixation. However, while it is clear that the sudden changes in visual input caused by microsaccades are sufficient to restore visibility, it has long been questioned whether this effect might be an epiphenomenon, rather than an important function of microsaccades. In this study, we compared the eye movements measured under conditions that either simulated or induced loss of visibility to those recorded when fading did not occur. Both drifts and microsaccades were unaffected by changes in the stimulus contrast and bandwidth that recreated the percept experienced during image fading. Under retinal stabilization, a condition in which observers reported fading, microsaccade rates decreased, instead of increasing as predicted by the fading prevention hypothesis. While image fading had no influence on oculomotor activity, eye movements were instead strongly modulated by the onset of the stimulus and by the requested precision of fixation. Microsaccades occurred more frequently and were more corrective for preceding drifts during accurate fixation on a cue than during relaxed fixation on a region of the screen. These results do not support a causal relationship between image fading and microsaccade production and show that the precision of required fixation is a major contributor to microsaccades.},

abstract = {Neurological findings suggest that the human striate cortex (V1) is an indispensable component of a neural substratum subserving static achromatic form perception in its own right and not simply as a central distributor of retinally derived information to extrastriate visual areas. This view is further supported by physiological evidence in primates that the finest-grained conjoined representation of spatial detail and retinotopic localization that underlies phenomenal visual experience for local brightness discriminations is selectively represented at cortical levels by the activity of certain neurons in V1. However, at first glance, support for these ideas would appear to be undermined by incontrovertible neurological evidence (visual hemineglect and the simultanagnosias) and recent psychophysical results on ‘crowding’ that confirm that activation of neurons in V1 may, at times, be insufficient to generate a percept. Moreover, a recent proposal suggests that neural correlates of visual awareness must project directly to those in executive space, thus automatically excluding V1 from a related perceptual space because V1 lacks such direct projections. Both sets of concerns are, however, resolved within the context of adaptive resonance theories. Recursive loops, linking the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) through successive cortical visual areas to the temporal lobe by means of a series of ascending and descending pathways, provide a neuronal substratum at each level within a modular framework for mutually consistent descriptions of sensory data. At steady state, such networks obviate the necessity that neural correlates of visual experience project directly to those in executive space because a neural phenomenal perceptual space subserving form vision is continuously updated by information from an object recognition space equivalent to that destined to reach executive space. Within this framework, activity in V1 may engender percepts that accompany figure-ground segregations only when dynamic incongruities are resolved both within and between ascending and descending streams. Synchronous neuronal activity on a short timescale within and across cortical areas, proposed and sometimes observed as perceptual correlates, may also serve as a marker that a steady state has been achieved, which, in turn, may be a requirement for the longer time constants that accompany the emergence and stability of perceptual states compared to the faster dynamics of adapting networks and the still faster dynamics of individual action potentials. Finally, the same consensus of neuronal activity across ascending and descending pathways linking multiple cortical areas that in anatomic sequence subserve phenomenal visual experiences and object recognition may underlie the normal unity of conscious experience.},

If so, we further inquire as to whether such recursive processing is essential only for loops between extrastriate cortical areas explicitly representing experiences such as color or motion back to V1 or whether it is processing between still higher levels and the areas computing such explicit representations that is exclusively or additionally essential for visual experience. If recursive processing is not essential for the emergence of conscious visual experience, then it should also be possible to determine whether it is only the intracortical sensory processing within areas computing explicit sensory representations that is required for perceptual experience or whether it is the subsequent processing of the output of such areas within more anterior cortical regions that engenders perception. The present analysis suggests that the questions posed here may ultimately become experimentally resolvable. Whatever the outcome, the results will likely open new approaches to identify the neural correlates of conscious visual perception.},

Activity in primary visual cortex (V1) increased when subjects perceived the higher contrast pattern and decreased when subjects perceived the lower contrast pattern. These fluctuations in V1 activity during rivalry were about 55% as large as those evoked by alternately presenting the two monocular images without rivalry. The rivalry-related fluctuations in V1 activity were roughly equal to those observed in other visual areas (V2, V3, V3a and V4v).

If so, second-order statistics could themselves carry information, rather than being invariably detrimental. Here we show that rate variability and noise correlation vary systematically with stimulus direction in directionally selective middle temporal (MT) neurons, leading to characteristic tuning curves. We show that such tuning emerges in a stochastic recurrent network, for a set of connectivity parameters that overlaps with a single-state scenario and multistability. Information theoretic analysis shows that second-order statistics carry information that can improve the accuracy of the population code.},

An example of the parallel architecture of the primate visual system is the existence of two principal pathways providing input to the middle temporal visual area (MT): namely, a direct projection from striate cortex (V1), and a set of indirect projections that also originate in V1 but then relay through V2 and V3. Here we have reversibly inactivated the indirect pathways while recording from MT neurons and measuring eye movements in alert monkeys, a procedure that has enabled us to assess whether the two different input pathways are redundant or whether they carry different kinds of information. We find that this inactivation causes a disproportionate degradation of binocular disparity tuning relative to direction tuning in MT neurons, suggesting that the indirect pathways are important in the recovery of depth in three-dimensional scenes.},

Each visual area receives an average of 10 to 15 inputs, many of them from cortical areas with overlapping, but not identical, functional properties. In this study, we assessed the functional significance of this anatomical parallelism to the middle temporal area (MT) of the macaque visual cortex. MT receives major feedforward inputs from areas V1, V2, and V3, but little is known about the properties of each of these pathways. We previously demonstrated that reversible inactivation of V2 and V3 causes a disproportionate degradation of tuning for binocular disparity of MT neurons, relative to direction tuning (Ponce et al., 2008). Here we show that MT neurons continued to encode speed and size information during V2/3 inactivation; however, many became significantly less responsive to fast speeds and others showed a modest decrease in surround suppression. These changes resemble previously reported effects of reducing stimulus contrast (Pack et al., 2005; Krekelberg et al., 2006), but we show here that they differ in their temporal dynamics. We find no evidence that the indirect pathways selectively target different functional regions within MT. Overall, our findings suggest that the indirect pathways to MT primarily convey modality-specific information on binocular disparity, but that they also contribute to the processing of stimuli moving at fast speeds.},

It is believed that the collinear flankers exert these effects through lateral interactions between neurons in the primary visual cortex (area V1), but the precise mechanisms underlying these contextual interactions remain unknown. Here, we directly examined this question by recording the effects of flankers on the responses of V1 neurons at parafoveal representations while monkeys performed a fixation task or a contrast detection task. We found, unexpectedly, that collinear flankers reduce the monkeys’ perceptual sensitivity for a central target element. This behavioral effect was explained by a flanker-induced increase in the activity of V1 neurons in the absence of the central target stimulus, which reduced the amplitude of the target response. Our results indicate that the dominant effect of collinear flankers in parafoveal vision is suppression and suggest that these suppressive effects are caused by a decrease in the dynamic range of neurons coding the central target.},

These attentional signals are weaker than the feature-selective responses, and their reliability may therefore be limited by the noisiness of neuronal responses. Here we show that it is possible to decode the locus of attention on a single trial from the activity of a small population of neurons in area V1. Previous studies suggested that correlations between the activities of neurons that are part of a population limit the information gain, but here we report that the impact of these noise correlations depends on the relative position of the neurons’ receptive fields. Correlations reduce the benefit of pooling neuronal responses evoked by the same object but actually enhance the advantage of pooling responses evoked by different objects. These opposing effects cancelled each other at the population level, so that the net effect of the noise correlations was negligible and attention could be decoded reliably. Our results suggest that noise correlations are caused by large-scale fluctuations in cortical excitability, which can be removed by a comparison of the response strengths evoked by different objects.},

Improvements in behavioral performance were closely associated with increasingly distinguishable population-level representations of task-relevant stimuli, as a result of stabilization of existing and recruitment of new neurons selective for these stimuli. These effects correlated with the appearance of multiple task-dependent signals during learning: those that increased neuronal selectivity across the population when expert animals engaged in the task, and those reflecting anticipation or behavioral choices specifically in neuronal subsets preferring the rewarded stimulus. Therefore, learning engages diverse mechanisms that modify sensory and non-sensory representations in V1 to adjust its processing to task requirements and the behavioral relevance of visual stimuli.},

abstract = {Understanding the impact of active dendritic properties on network activity in vivo has so far been restricted to studies in anesthetized animals. However, to date no study has been made to determine the direct effect of the anesthetics themselves on dendritic properties. Here, we investigated the effects of three types of anesthetics commonly used for animal experiments (urethane, pentobarbital and ketamine/xylazine). We investigated the generation of calcium spikes, the propagation of action potentials (APs) along the apical dendrite and the somatic firing properties in the presence of anesthetics in vitro using dual somatodendritic whole cell recordings. Calcium spikes were evoked with dendritic current injection and high-frequency trains of APs at the soma. Surprisingly, we found that the direct actions of anesthetics on calcium spikes were very different. Two anesthetics (urethane and pentobarbital) suppressed dendritic calcium spikes in vitro, whereas a mixture of ketamine and xylazine enhanced them. Propagation of spikes along the dendrite was not significantly affected by any of the anesthetics but there were various changes in somatic firing properties that were highly dependent on the anesthetic. Last, we examined the effects of anesthetics on calcium spike initiation and duration in vivo using high-frequency trains of APs generated at the cell body. We found the same anesthetic-dependent direct effects in addition to an overall reduction in dendritic excitability in anesthetized rats with all three anesthetics compared with the slice preparation.},

We found that the amplitude of excitatory synaptic currents necessary to fire rodent pyramidal cells, the threshold excitatory current, increased with stimulus strength. Consequently, the relative contribution of individual afferents in firing a neuron was inversely proportional to the total number of active afferents. Feedforward inhibition, acting homogeneously across pyramidal cells, ensured that threshold excitatory currents increased with stimulus strength. In contrast, heterogeneities in the distribution of excitatory currents in the neuronal population determined the specific set of pyramidal cells recruited. Together, these mechanisms expand the range of afferent input strengths that neuronal populations can represent.},

abstract = {People often remain “blind” to visual changes occurring during a brief interruption of the display. The processing stages responsible for such failure remain unresolved. We used event-related potentials to determine the time course of brain activity during conscious change detection versus change blindness. Participants saw two successive visual displays, each with two faces, and reported whether one of the faces changed between the first and second displays. Relative to blindness, change detection was associated with a distinct pattern of neural activity at several successive processing stages, including an enhanced occipital P1 response and a sustained frontal activity (CNV-like potential) after the first display, before the change itself. The amplitude of the N170 and P3 responses after the second visual display were also modulated by awareness of the face change. Furthermore, a unique topography of event-related potential activity was observed during correct change and correct no-change reports, but not during blindness, with a recurrent time course in the stimulus sequence and simultaneous sources in the parietal and temporo-occipital cortex. These results indicate that awareness of visual changes may depend on the attentional state subserved by coordinated neural activity in a distributed network, before the onset of the change itself.},

abstract = {The membrane conductance of a pyramidal neuron in vivo is substantially increased by background synaptic input. Increased membrane conductance, or shunting, does not simply reduce neuronal excitability. Recordings from hippocampal pyramidal neurons using dynamic clamp revealed that adaptation caused complete cessation of spiking in the high conductance state, whereas repetitive spiking could persist despite adaptation in the low conductance state. This behavior was reproduced in a phase plane model and was explained by a shunting-induced increase in voltage threshold. The increase in threshold allows greater activation of the M current (I(M)) at subthreshold potentials and reduces the minimum adaptation required to stabilize the system; in contrast, activation of the afterhyperpolarization current is unaffected by the increase in threshold and therefore remains unable to stop repetitive spiking. The nonlinear interaction between shunting and I(M) has other important consequences. First, timing of spikes elicited by brief stimuli is more precise when background spikes elicited by sustained input are prohibited, as occurs exclusively with I(M)-mediated adaptation in the high conductance state. Second, activation of I(M) at subthreshold potentials, which is increased in the high conductance state, hyperpolarizes average membrane potential away from voltage threshold, allowing only large, rapid fluctuations to reach threshold and elicit spikes. These results suggest that the shift from a low to high conductance state in a pyramidal neuron is accompanied by a switch from encoding time-averaged input with firing rate to encoding transient inputs with precisely timed spikes, in effect, switching the operational mode from integration to coincidence detection.},

abstract = {Within the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the thalamus, retinal ganglion cell (RGC) projections excite thalamocortical (TC) cells that in turn relay visual information to the cortex. Local interneurons in the dLGN regulate the output of TC cells by releasing GABA from their axonal boutons and specialized dendritic spines. Here we examine the functional role of these highly specialized interneurons and how they inhibit TC cells in mouse brain slices. It was widely thought that activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5) on interneuron spines leads to local GABA release restricted to sites receiving active RGC inputs. We reexamined experiments that supported this view, and found that in the presence of TTX, mGluR5 agonists evoked GABA release that could instead be explained by interneuron depolarization and widespread intracellular calcium increases. We also examined GABA release evoked by RGC activation and found that high-frequency stimulation induces a long-lasting subthreshold afterdepolarization, persistent firing, or prolonged plateau potentials in interneurons and evokes sustained GABA release. mGluR5 antagonists virtually eliminated sustained spiking and the resulting widespread calcium-signals, and reduced inhibition by >50%. The remaining inhibition appeared to be mediated by a fraction of interneurons in which plateau potentials produced large and widespread calcium increases. Local calcium signals required for local GABA release were not observed. These findings indicate that, contrary to the previous view, RGC activation does not simply evoke localized GABA release by activating mGluR5, rather, synaptic activation of mGluR5 acts primarily by depolarizing interneurons and evoking widespread dendritic GABA release.},

abstract = {We studied neurons in areas V1, V2 and PMLS of anaesthetized cats, assessing their speed tuning using steps to constant speeds, and acceleration and deceleration tuning using speed ramps. The results show that the speed tuning of neurons in all three cortical areas is highly dependent on prior motion history, with early responses during speed steps tuned to higher speeds than later responses. The responses to speed ramps are profoundly influenced by speed-dependent response latencies and ongoing changes in neuronal speed tuning due to adaptation. Acceleration evokes larger transient and sustained responses than subsequent deceleration of the same rate, with this disparity increasing with ramp rate. Consequently, there was little correlation between preferred speeds measured using speed steps, acceleration or deceleration. From 146 recorded cells, the proportion of cells that were clearly speed tuned ranged from 69-100% across the three brain areas. However, only 13 cells showed good skewed Gaussian fits and systematic variation in their responses to a range of accelerations. Although suggestive of acceleration coding, this apparent tuning was attributable to a cell’s speed tuning and the different stimulus durations at each acceleration rate. Thus, while the majority of cells showed speed tuning, none unequivocally showed acceleration tuning. The results are largely consistent with an existing model that predicts responses to accelerating stimuli developed for macaque MT, which showed that the responses to acceleration can be decoded if adaptation is taken into account. However, the present results suggest future models should include stimulus-specific adaptation and speed-dependent response latencies.},

The ocular dominance (OD) of individual cortical neurons varies and may be changed by altering visual experience during the developmental critical period. Estimates of OD, commonly used to quantify the right and left eye synaptic inputs, have previously been based on spike rate. Membrane potential (V(m)), however, is more closely related to the synaptic inputs onto neurons and should therefore more closely reflect the degree of input from the two eyes. To determine the relationship between OD based on membrane potential and on spike rate, intracellular recordings were made from visual cortical neurons. OD based on spike rate was systematically more monocular than OD based on membrane potential. The discrepancy between membrane-potential OD and spike-rate OD may be accounted for by a simple model of V(m)-to-spike-rate transformation.},

This cross-orientation suppression has been interpreted as evidence for cross-orientation inhibition: synaptic inhibition among cortical cells with different preferred orientations. In intracellular recordings from simple cells, however, we found that cross-oriented stimuli suppressed, rather than enhanced, synaptic inhibition and, at the same time, suppressed synaptic excitation. Much of the suppression of excitation could be accounted for by the behavior of geniculate relay cells: contrast saturation and rectification in relay cell responses, when applied to a linear feed-forward model, predicted cross-orientation suppression of the modulation (F1) component of excitation evoked in simple cells. In addition, we found that the suppression of the spike output of simple cells was almost twice the suppression of their synaptic inputs. Thus, cross-orientation suppression, like orientation selectivity, is strongly amplified by threshold.},

pages = {2941–2950}, 
year = {2006}, 
abstract = {We recorded the responses of direction-selective simple and complex cells in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. When studied with sine-wave gratings, almost all simple cells in V1 had responses that were separable for spatial and temporal frequency: the preferred temporal frequency did not change and preferred speed decreased as a function of the spatial frequency of the grating. As in previous recordings from the middle temporal visual area (MT), approximately one-quarter of V1 complex cells had separable responses to spatial and temporal frequency, and one-quarter were “speed tuned” in the sense that preferred speed did not change as a function of spatial frequency. Half fell between these two extremes. Reducing the contrast of the gratings caused the population of V1 complex cells to become more separable in their tuning for spatial and temporal frequency. Contrast dependence is explained by the contrast gain of the neurons, which was relatively higher for gratings that were either both of high or both of low temporal and spatial frequency. For stimuli that comprised two spatially superimposed sine-wave gratings, the preferred speeds and tuning bandwidths of V1 neurons could be predicted from the sum of the responses to the component gratings presented alone, unlike neurons in MT that showed nonlinear interactions. We conclude that spatiotemporal modulation of contrast gain creates speed tuning from separable inputs in V1 complex cells. Speed tuning in MT could be primarily inherited from V1, but processing that occurs after V1 and possibly within MT computes selective combinations of speed-tuned signals of special relevance for downstream perceptual and motor},

In the equiluminant plane, wherein stimuli are modulated in chromaticity with luminance held constant, such enhancement is strongly contrast dependent. These projections also robustly enhance the responses of magnocellular neurons but contrast independently only at high contrasts.

abstract = {The responses of monkey retinal ganglion cells to sinusoidal stimuli of various temporal frequencies were measured and analyzed at a number of mean light levels. Temporal modulation tuning functions (TMTFs) were measured at each mean level by varying the drift rate of a sine-wave grating of fixed spatial frequency and contrast. The changes seen in ganglion cell temporal responses with changes in adaptation state were similar to those observed in human subjects and in turtle horizontal cells and cones tested with sinusoidally flickering stimuli; “Weber’s Law” behavior was seen at low temporal frequencies but not at higher temporal frequencies. Temporal responses were analyzed in two ways: (1) at each light level, the TMTFs were fit by a model consisting of a cascade of low- and high-pass filters; (2) the family of TMTFs collected over a range of light levels for a given cell was fit by a linear negative feedback model in which the gain of the feedback was proportional to the mean light level. Analysis (1) revealed that the temporal responses of one class of monkey ganglion cells (M cells) were more phasic at both photopic and mesopic light levels than the responses of P ganglion cells. In analysis (2), the linear negative feedback model accounted reasonably well for changes in gain and dynamics seen in three P cells and one M cell. From the feedback model, it was possible to estimate the light level at which the dark-adapted gain of the cone pathways in the primate retina fell by a factor of two. This value was two to three orders of magnitude lower than the value estimated from recordings of isolated monkey cones. Thus, while a model which includes a single stage of negative feedback can account for the changes in gain and dynamics associated with light adaptation in the photopic and mesopic ranges of vision, the underlying physical mechanisms are unknown and may involve elements in the primate retina other than the cone.},

Reversibly inactivating lateral pulvinar prevented supra-granular V1 neurons from responding to visual stimulation. Reversible, focal excitation of lateral pulvinar receptive fields increased the visual responses in coincident V1 receptive fields fourfold and shifted partially overlapping V1 receptive fields toward the center of excitation. V1 responses to regions surrounding the excited lateral pulvinar receptive fields were suppressed. LGN responses were unaffected by these lateral pulvinar manipulations.

I argue that the new evidence from neural imaging and clinical neuropsychology does little to justify this recidivism because it does not address the format of mental images. I also discuss some reasons why the picture theory is so resistant to counterarguments and suggest ways in which non-pictorial theories might account for the apparent spatial nature of images},

Recent research has revealed mechanisms for figure-ground organization in the visual cortex, but how these mechanisms relate to the attention process remains unclear. Here we show that the influences of figure-ground organization and volitional (top-down) attention converge in single neurons of area V2 in Macaca mulatta. Although we found assignment of border ownership for attended and for ignored figures, attentional modulation was stronger when the attended figure was located on the neuron’s preferred side of border ownership. When the border between two overlapping figures was placed in the receptive field, responses depended on the side of attention, and enhancement was generally found on the neuron’s preferred side of border ownership. This correlation suggests that the neural network that creates figure-ground organization also provides the interface for the top-down selection process.},

However,the brain typically makes decisions based on single events by evaluating the activity of large neuronal populations. Therefore, to further understand how the brain processes information, it is important to shift from a single-neuron, multiple-trial framework to multiple-neuron, single-trial methodologies. Two related approaches--decoding and information theory--can be used to extract single-trial information from the activity of neuronal populations. Such population analysis can give us more information about how neurons encode stimulus features than traditional single-cell studies.},

In this report we describe the ultrastructure of these fibers and their relations with other elements in the neuropil of the lateral geniculate nucleus. Cholinergic fibers were labeled with an antibody to choline acetyltransferase (ChAT), the synthesizing enzyme for acetylcholine (ACh). In the A-laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus, ChAT + profiles are small and contain tightly packed, mostly round vesicles. Some end in encapsulated synaptic zones where they form asymmetrical synaptic contacts with processes of both projection cells and interneurons. Others form synapses upon the shafts of dendrites. Of the four classical types of vesicle-containing profiles identified by Guillery (Z. Zellforsch. Mikrosk. 96:1-38, ‘69; Vision Res. [Suppl.] 3:211-227, ‘71), ChAT + profiles most closely resemble RSD profiles (Round vesicles, Small profile, Dark mitochondria). However, as a population, ChAT + profiles can be distinguished from the unlabeled population of RSD profiles because they are larger in size, contain more mitochondria, and make synapses with smaller postsynaptic membrane specializations. Each of these differences is statistically significant and together they indicate that ChAT + profiles are a distinct morphological type of synaptic profile. ChAT + profiles in the perigeniculate nucleus resemble those found in the lateral geniculate nucleus; they also make synapses with obvious postsynaptic thickenings.},

Here I argue that the latter view best captures the essence of brain function, a position that accords well with the allocation of the brain’s energy resources. Recognizing the importance of intrinsic activity will require integrating knowledge from cognitive and systems neuroscience with cellular and molecular neuroscience where ion channels, receptors, components of signal transduction and metabolic pathways are all in a constant state of flux.},

The size and shape of the receptive field (RF) was mapped with small patches of translating random dots and the resulting data were fitted with a generalized Gaussian. Results show that the RF area increases with eccentricity, and is larger in lamina 5 than in other layers. Most of these RFs are elongated, and the axis of elongation tends to be orthogonal to the preferred direction of motion. The direction selectivity is maintained in all positions in the RF, but layer 5 cells are less direction-selective than cells in other layers. In a second series of experiments, radial dimensions of the classical RF and the antagonistic surround were estimated from area summation tests. These data were fitted with the difference of the integrals of two Gaussians. Surrounds were weakest in layer 4 and strongest in layer 2. Optimal stimulus diameters, also estimated from the area summation curve, were larger in the infragranular layers than in the other layers. The maximum sensitivity of the surround was clearly displaced from the classical RF (CRF) centre, indicating that the surround is not concentric with the CRF. This radial offset and the extent of the surround were largest in layers 2 and 5 and smallest in 3a. The extent of the surround half-height equalled, on average, 3-4 times that of the CRF. These results suggest that antagonistic surrounds are constructed in MT, probably through horizontal connections, and that a strong vertical organization exists in area MT, as has been shown for V1.},

abstract = {A total of 310 MT/V5 single cells were tested in anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys with moving random-dot stimuli. At optimum stimulus parameters, latencies ranged from 35 to 325 ms with a mean of 87+/-45 (SD) ms. By examining the relationship between latency and response levels, stimulus parameters, and stimulus selectivities, we attempted to isolate the contributions of these factors to latency and to identify delays representing intervening synapses (circuitry) and signal processing (flow of information through that circuitry). First, the relationship between stimulus parameters and latency was investigated by varying stimulus speed and direction for individual cells. Resulting changes in latencies were explainable in terms of response levels corresponding to how closely the actual stimulus matched the preferred stimulus of the cell. Second, the relationship between stimulus selectivity and latency across the population of cells was examined using the optimum speed and direction of each neuron. A weak tendency for cells tuned for slow speeds to have longer latencies was explainable by lower response rates among slower-tuned neurons. In contrast, sharper direction tuning was significantly associated with short latencies even after taking response rate into account, (P = 0.002, ANCOVA). Accordingly, even the first 10 ms of the population response fully demonstrates direction tuning. A third study, which examined the relationship between antagonistic surrounds and latency, revealed a significant association between the strength of the surround and the latency that was independent of response levels (P < 0.002, ANCOVA). Neurons having strong surrounds exhibited latencies averaging 20 ms longer than those with little or no surround influence, suggesting that neurons with surrounds represent a later stage in processing with one or more intervening synapses. The laminar distribution of latencies closely followed the average surround antagonism in each layer, increasing with distance from input layer IV but precisely mirroring response levels, which were highest near the input layer and gradually decreased with distance from input layer IV. Layer II proved the exception with unexpectedly shorter latencies (P< 0.02, ANOVA) yet showing only modest response levels. The short latency and lack of strong direction tuning in layer II is consistent with input from the superior colliculus. Finally, experiments with static stimuli showed that latency does not vary with response rate for such stimuli, suggesting a fundamentally different mode of processing than that for a moving stimulus.},

The present study examines the effects of training in an orientation discrimination task on the response properties of V4 neurons in awake rhesus monkeys. Results indicate that the changes induced in V4 are indeed larger than those in V1. Nonspecific effects of training included a decrease in response variance, and an increase in overall orientation selectivity in V4. The orientation-specific changes involved a local steepening in the orientation tuning curve around the trained orientation that selectively improved orientation discriminability at the trained orientation. Moreover, these changes were largely confined to the population of neurons whose orientation tuning was optimal for signaling small differences in orientation at the trained orientation. Finally, the modifications were restricted to the part of the tuning curve close to the trained orientation. Thus, we conclude that it is the most informative V4 neurons, those most directly involved in the discrimination, that are specifically modified by perceptual learning.},

We found that conscious perception and both measures of unconscious processing of chromatic information depended on activity in early visual cortex 70-100 msec after stimulus presentation.

Distinct regions within IT cortex are also selective to specific object categories such as faces. Here we tested the topographic relationship between retinotopic maps and face-selective patches in macaque visual cortex using high-resolution fMRI and retinotopic face stimuli. Distinct subregions within face-selective patches showed either (1) a coarse retinotopic map of eccentricity and polar angle, (2) a retinotopic bias to a specific location of visual field, or (3) nonretinotopic selectivity. In general, regions along the lateral convexity of IT cortex showed more overlap between retinotopic maps and face selectivity, compared with regions within the STS. Thus, face patches in macaques can be subdivided into smaller patches with distinguishable retinotopic properties.},

A homogeneous grey square subtending 1.5 degrees was displayed against a background of twinkling two-dimensional noise of equal mean luminance. On steady eccentric fixation for 10 s the square vanished and was filled in by the twinkling noise from the surround. Using this display we found that ‘filling in’ is an active visual process that probably involves creating an actual neural representation of the surround rather than merely ignoring the absence of information from the scotoma; filling in can occur separately for colour and texture, suggesting separate mechanisms; the filling-in process does not completely suppress information from the scotoma, even after an image has faded completely from consciousness it can nevertheless contribute to motion perception; and the process can be strongly influenced by illusory contours.},

Due to variations in LTS amplitude, the number of action potentials evoked by an LTS could vary between 1 and 8. These data confirm the presence of two modes of firing in the monkey for thalamic relay cells, tonic and burst, the latter related to the activation of LTSs. With these details of the cellular processes underlying burst firing, we could account for many of the firing patterns we recorded from the lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus in behaving monkeys. In particular, we found clear evidence of burst firing during alert wakefulness, which had been thought to occur only during sleep or certain pathological states. This makes it likely that the burst firing seen in awake humans has the same cellular basis of LTSs, and this supports previous suggestions that burst firing represents an important relay mode for visual processing.},

Recent psychophysical studies have suggested that this is due to a reduction in responsiveness of magnocellular (M), but not parvocellular (P), cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus. To address this and other phenomena of responsiveness during saccades, we recorded from geniculate neurons in the behaving monkey before, during, and after saccades. Specifically, we measured neuronal responses to a flashing, whole-field illumination. Contrary to the prediction, most M neurons showed pronounced enhancement of visual activity during saccades, whereas such responsiveness of parvocellular (P) neurons was not significantly affected by saccades. We also analyzed the extent to which saccades affected burst firing, which results from activation of a voltage-dependent Ca2+ conductance. We found that both M and P cells displayed a significant suppression of burst firing during saccades. These results do not support the idea that saccadic suppression has an obvious substrate in reduced responsiveness of geniculate cells, but this suppression may be related to an increased visual threshold for detection associated with reduced burst firing.},

Primates have traditionally been used in these studies because of their ability to perform more complex behaviors closely akin to those of humans, a desirable prerequisite since our ultimate aim is to elucidate the neuronal correlates of human behaviors. A wealth of knowledge has accumulated on the sensory and motor systems such as vision, audition, and eye movements. For more demanding behaviors where the main focus has been on attention, recordings in awake primates have begun to yield valuable data on the centers of the brain that are reactive to different attributes of this behavior. As a result, various hypotheses of the origin and distribution of attentional effects have evolved. For instance, visual attentional effects have been described not only in the higher cortical area (V4) but also in areas earlier in the visual pathway which presumably involve a feedback mechanism in the latter region. Here we outline the ways in which we have successfully used these methods to make single-cell recordings in awake macaques to show how certain behavioral paradigms affect neurons of the thalamus (with emphasis on the lateral geniculate nucleus). As we have done with established techniques these methods can be readily adapted to incorporate most behaviors needed to be tested and allow recordings to be made in virtually any part of the brain.},

Certain differences between first- and higher-order thalamic relays (which relay peripheral information to the cortex versus information from one cortical area to another, respectively) suggest that more bursting might occur in the higher-order relays. Accordingly, we recorded bursting behavior in single cells from awake, behaving rhesus monkeys in first-order (the lateral geniculate nucleus, the ventral posterior nucleus, and the ventral portion of the medial geniculate nucleus) and higher-order (pulvinar and the medial dorsal nucleus) thalamic relays. We found that the extent of bursting was dramatically greater in the higher-order than in the first-order relays, and this increased bursting correlated with lower spontaneous activity in the higher-order relays. If bursting effectively signals the introduction of new information to a cortical area, as suggested, this increased bursting may be more important in corticocortical transmission than in transmission of primary information to cortex.},

Here, we address the functional significance of the IDS cortical operating points by investigating our model cortex response to the Hikosaka line-motion illusion (LMI) stimulus-a cue of a quickly flashed stationary square followed a few milliseconds later by a stationary bar. As revealed by voltage-sensitive dye imaging, there is an intriguing similarity between the cortical spatiotemporal activity in response to (i) the Hikosaka LMI stimulus and (ii) a small moving square. This similarity is believed to be associated with the preattentive illusory motion perception. Our numerical cortex produces similar spatiotemporal patterns in response to the two stimuli above, which are both in very good agreement with experimental results. The essential network mechanisms underpinning the LMI phenomenon in our model are (i) the spatiotemporal structure of the LMI input as sculpted by the lateral geniculate nucleus, (ii) a priming effect of the long-range NMDA-type cortical coupling, and (iii) the NMDA conductance-voltage correlation manifested in the IDS state. This mechanism in our model cortex, in turn, suggests a physiological underpinning for the LMI-associated patterns in the visual cortex of anaesthetized cat.},

A subset of neurons responsible for carrying the residual errors showed endstopping and other extra-classical receptive-field effects. These results suggest that rather than being exclusively feedforward phenomena, nonclassical surround effects in the visual cortex may also result from cortico-cortical feedback as a consequence of the visual system using an efficient hierarchical strategy for encoding natural images.},

abstract = {We investigated whether it is possible to infer spike trains solely on the basis of the underlying local field potentials (LFPs). Using support vector machines and linear regression models, we found that in the primary visual cortex (V1) of monkeys, spikes can indeed be inferred from LFPs, at least with moderate success. Although there is a considerable degree of variation across electrodes, the low-frequency structure in spike trains (in the 100-ms range) can be inferred with reasonable accuracy, whereas exact spike positions are not reliably predicted. Two kinds of features of the LFP are exploited for prediction: the frequency power of bands in the high -range (40‚Äì90 Hz) and information contained in low-frequency oscillations (<10 Hz), where both phase and power modulations are informative. Information analysis revealed that both features code (mainly) independent aspects of the spike-to-LFP relationship, with the low-frequency LFP phase coding for temporally clustered spiking activity. Although both features and prediction quality are similar during seminatural movie stimuli and spontaneous activity, prediction performance during spontaneous activity degrades much more slowly with increasing electrode distance. The general trend of data obtained with anesthetized animals is qualitatively mirrored in that of a more limited data set recorded in V1 of non-anesthetized monkeys. In contrast to the cortical field potentials, thalamic LFPs (e.g., LFPs derived from recordings in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus) hold no useful information for predicting spiking activity.},

Using a white noise stimulus and reverse correlation analysis, we compared the receptive fields associated with retinal spikes over a range of ISIs (0-120 ms). Results showed that, although the location and sign of retinal ganglion cell receptive fields are invariant to ISI, the size and amplitude of receptive fields vary with ISI. These results support the notion that ISI-based filtering of retinal spikes can serve as a mechanism for shaping receptive fields.},

By recording from monosynaptically connected pairs of retinal ganglion cells and LGN neurons in vivo in the cat, we show that relayed spikes are more likely than nonrelayed spikes to be evoked by stimuli that match the receptive fields of the recorded cells and that an interspike interval-based mechanism contributes to the process. Relayed spikes are also more reliable in their timing and number where they often achieve the theoretical limit of minimum variance. As a result, relayed spikes carry more visual information per spike. Based on these results, we conclude that retinogeniculate processing increases sparseness in the neural code by selectively relaying the highest fidelity spikes to the visual cortex.},

Activation was found in regions corresponding to the retinotopic visual areas of sighted humans, including the calcarine sulcus (V1). No such occipital activation was found in sighted humans. One year later, the same blind subjects participated in a second fMRI scan, to study the contribution of semantic elements and episodic memory to the occipital activation. The subjects performed an episodic-memory task, requiring recognition of words that were originally presented in the first scan. We demonstrate here that the magnitude of V1 activation during the recognition task is correlated with memory performance, assessed during the scan. Across the blind, the better-remembered set of words elicited greater V1 activation than words from the poorly-remembered set, although the semantic components and the behavioral task were similar in the two sets. This indicates that on top of semantic processing (suggested previously), V1 activation in the blind is probably associated with long-term episodic memory. Indeed, within the blind, those who showed better recognition-memory performance had greater V1 activation compared with the poorer performers. We conclude that the posterior occipital cortex (including V1) of the congenitally blind is likely to be involved in episodic retrieval.},

We show that the responses of many visual neurons in the cat retinal ganglion, cat lateral geniculate nucleus, and macaque primary visual cortex fall into the second class, which implies that the pattern of spike times can carry significant information about visual stimuli.

We show here that the information conveyed by an action potential depends on the duration of the immediately preceding interspike interval (ISI). The interspike intervals can be grouped into several different classes on the basis of reproducible features in the interspike interval histograms. Spikes in different classes bear different relationships to the visual stimulus, both qualitatively (in terms of the average stimulus preceding each spike) and quantitatively (in terms of the amount of information encoded per spike and per second). Spikes preceded by very short intervals (3 msec or less) convey information most efficiently and contribute disproportionately to the overall receptive-field properties of the neuron. Overall, V1 neurons can transmit between 5 and 30 bits of information per second in response to rapidly varying, pseudorandom stimuli, with an efficiency of ~25%. Although some (but not all) of our results would be expected from neurons that use a firing-rate code to transmit information, the evidence suggests that visual neurons are well equipped to decode stimulus-related information on the basis of relative spike timing and ISI duration},

abstract = {We estimate the rates at which neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized macaque monkeys transmit stimulus-related information in response to three types of visual stimulus. The stimulirandomly modulated checkerboard patterns, stationary sinusoidal gratings, and drifting sinusoidal gratingshave very different spatiotemporal structures. We obtain the overall rate of information transmission, which we call formal information, by a direct method. We find the highest information rates in the responses of simple cells to drifting gratings (median: 10.3 bits/s, 0.92 bits/spike); responses to randomly modulated stimuli and stationary gratings transmit information at significantly lower rates. In general, simple cells transmit information at higher rates, and over a larger range, than do complex cells. Thus in the responses of V1 neurons, stimuli that are rapidly modulated do not necessarily evoke higher information rates, as might be the case with motion-sensitive neurons in area MT. By an extension of the direct method, we parse the formal information into attribute-specific components, which provide estimates of the information transmitted about contrast and spatiotemporal pattern. We find that contrast-specific information rates vary across neuronsabout 0.3 to 2.1 bits/s or 0.05 to 0.22 bits/spikebut depend little on stimulus type. Spatiotemporal pattern-specific information rates, however, depend strongly on the type of stimulus and neuron (simple or complex). The remaining information rate, typically between 10 and 32% of the formal information rate for each neuron, cannot be unambiguously assigned to either contrast or spatiotemporal pattern. This indicates that some information concerning these two stimulus attributes is confounded in the responses of single neurons in V1. A model that considers a simple cell to consist of a linear spatiotemporal filter followed by a static rectifier predicts higher information rates than are found in real neurons and completely fails to replicate the performance of real cells in generating the confounded information},

In this paper, the information that V1 responses convey about the contrast of static visual stimuli is explicitly calculated. These responses often contain several easily distinguished temporal components, which will be called latency, transient, tonic, and off. Calculating the information about contrast conveyed in each component and in groups of components makes it possible to delineate aspects of the temporal structure that may be relevant for contrast encoding. The results indicate that as much or more contrast-related information is encoded into the temporal structure of spike train responses as into the firing rate and that the temporally coded information is manifested most strongly in the latency to response onset. Transient, tonic, and off responses contribute relatively little. The results also reveal that temporal coding is important for distinguishing subtle contrast differences, whereas firing rates are useful for gross discrimination. This suggests that the temporal structure of neurons’ responses may extend the dynamic range for contrast encoding in the primate visual system},

We recorded from individual neurons in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) while presenting randomly modulated visual stimuli. The responses to repeated stimuli were reproducible, whereas the responses evoked by nonrepeated stimuli drawn from the same ensemble were variable. Stimulus-dependent information was quantified directly from the difference in entropy of these neural responses. We show that a single LGN cell can encode much more visual information than had been demonstrated previously, ranging from 15 to 102 bits/sec across our sample of cells. Information rate was correlated with the firing rate of the cell, for a consistent rate of 3.6 +/- 0.6 bits/spike (mean +/- SD). This information can primarily be attributed to the high temporal precision with which firing probability is modulated; many individual spikes were timed with better than 1 msec precision. We introduce a way to estimate the amount of information encoded in temporal patterns of firing, as distinct from the information in the time varying firing rate at any temporal resolution. Using this method, we find that temporal patterns sometimes introduce redundancy but often encode visual information. The contribution of temporal patterns ranged from -3.4 to +25.5 bits/sec or from -9.4 to +24.9% of the total information content of the responses.},

Over the initial 40 ms of visual stimulation, excitation from recurrent circuits in visual cortex progressively increased to exceed direct thalamocortical excitation. Even when recurrent excitation exceeded thalamic excitation, upon silencing thalamus, sensory-evoked activity in cortex decayed rapidly, with a time constant of 10 ms, which is similar to a neuron’s integration time window. In awake mice, this cortical decay function predicted the time-locking of cortical activity to thalamic input at frequencies <15 Hz and attenuation of the cortical response to higher frequencies. Under anesthesia, depression at thalamocortical synapses disrupted the fidelity of sensory transmission. Thus, we determine dynamics intrinsic to cortical recurrent circuits that transform afferent input in time.},

abstract = {Differences between visual pathways representing darks and lights have been shown to affect spatial resolution and detection timing. Both psychophysical and physiological studies suggest an underlying retinal origin with amplification in primary visual cortex (V1). Here we show that temporal asymmetries in the processing of darks and lights create motion in terms of propagating activity across V1. Exploiting the high spatiotemporal resolution of voltage-sensitive dye imaging, we captured population responses to abrupt local changes of luminance in cat V1. For stimulation we used two neighboring small squares presented on either bright or dark backgrounds. When a single square changed from dark to bright or vice versa, we found coherent population activity emerging at the respective retinal input locations. However, faster rising and decay times were obtained for the bright to dark than the dark to bright changes. When the two squares changed luminance simultaneously in opposite polarities, we detected a propagating wave front of activity that originated at the cortical location representing the darkened square and rapidly expanded toward the region representing the brightened location. Thus, simultaneous input led to sequential activation across cortical retinotopy. Importantly, this effect was independent of the squares’ contrast with the background. We suggest imbalance in dark–bright processing as a driving force in the generation of wave-like activity. Such propagation may convey motion signals and influence perception of shape whenever abrupt shifts in visual objects or gaze cause counterchange of luminance at high-contrast borders.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT An elementary process in vision is the detection of darks and lights through the retina via ON and OFF channels. Psychophysical and physiological studies suggest that differences between these channels affect spatial resolution and detection thresholds. Here we show that temporal asymmetries in the processing of darks and lights create motion signals across visual cortex. Using two neighboring squares, which simultaneously counterchanged luminance, we discovered propagating activity that was strictly drawn out from cortical regions representing the darkened location. Thus, a synchronous stimulus event translated into sequential wave-like brain activation. Such propagation may convey motion signals accessible in higher brain areas, whenever abrupt shifts in visual objects or gaze cause counterchange of luminance at high-contrast borders.},

However, a wide class of neuronal computations requires input integration on long timescales. As a paradigmatic example, entorhinal grid fields have been thought to be generated by the democratic summation of independent dendritic oscillations performing direction-selective path integration. We analyzed how multiple dendritic oscillators embedded in the same neuron integrate inputs separately and determine somatic membrane voltage jointly. We found that the interaction of dendritic oscillations leads to phase locking, which sets an upper limit on the timescale for independent input integration. Factors that increase this timescale also decrease the influence that the dendritic oscillations exert on somatic voltage. In entorhinal stellate cells, interdendritic coupling dominates and causes these cells to act as single oscillators. Our results suggest a fundamental trade-off between local and global processing in dendritic trees integrating ongoing signals.},

ON responses are thought to originate by exclusive use of metabotropic glutamate receptor 6 (mGluR6) expressed in retinal ON bipolar cells. Paradoxically, we find ON responses in retinal ganglion cells of mGluR6-null mice, but they occur at long latency. The long-latency ON responses are not blocked by metabotropic glutamate or cholinergic receptor antagonists and are not produceby activation of receptive field surrounds. We show that these longer-latency ON responses are initiated in the OFF pathways. Our results expose a previously unrecognized intrinsic property of OFF retinal pathways that generates responses to light onset. In mGluR6-null mice, long-latency ON responses are observed in the visual cortex, indicating that they can be conducted reliably to higher visual areas. In wild-type (WT) mice, APB (DL-2-amino-4-phosphonobutyric acid), an mGluR6 agonist, blocks normal, short-latency ON responses but unmasks longer-latency ones. We find that these potentially confusing ON responses in the OFF pathway are actively suppressed in WT mice via two pharmacologically separable retinal circuits that are activated by the ON system in the retina. Consequently, we propose that a major function of the signaling of the ON pathway to the OFF pathway is suppression of these mistimed, and therefore inappropriate, light-evoked responses.},

abstract = {Our ability to explore our surroundings requires a combination of high-resolution vision and frequent rotations of the visual axis toward objects of interest. Such gaze shifts are themselves a source of powerful retinal stimulation, and so the visual system appears to have evolved mechanisms to maintain perceptual stability during movements of the eyes in space. The mechanisms underlying this perceptual stability can be probed in the laboratory by briefly presenting a stimulus around the time of a saccadic eye movement and asking subjects to report its position. Under such conditions, there is a systematic misperception of the probes toward the saccade end point. This perisaccadic compression of visual space has been the subject of much research, but few studies have attempted to relate it to specific brain mechanisms. Here, we show that the magnitude of perceptual compression for a wide variety of probe stimuli and saccade amplitudes is quantitatively predicted by a simple heuristic model based on the geometry of retinotopic representations in the primate brain. Specifically, we propose that perisaccadic compression is determined by the distance between the probe and saccade end point on a map that has a logarithmic representation of visual space, similar to those found in numerous cortical and subcortical visual structures. Under this assumption, the psychophysical data on perisaccadic compression can be appreciated intuitively by imagining that, around the time of a saccade, the brain confounds nearby oculomotor and sensory signals while attempting to localize the position of objects in visual space.},

This assumption plays an important role in our understanding of visual processing, and models of motion processing in particular. We used extracellular recordings in area MT of awake, behaving monkeys (M. mulatta) to test this assumption with a novel reverse correlation approach. Nearly half of the MT neurons in our sample deviated significantly from the classical view. First, in many cells, direction preference changed with the location of the stimulus within the receptive field. Second, the spatial response profile often had multiple peaks with apparent gaps in between. This shows that visual motion analysis in MT has access to motion detectors that are more complex than commonly thought. This complexity could be a mere byproduct of imperfect development, but can also be understood as the natural consequence of the non-linear, recurrent interactions among laterally connected MT neurons. An important direction for future research is to investigate whether these in homogeneities are advantageous, how they can be incorporated into models of motion detection, and whether they can provide quantitative insight into the underlying effective connectivity.},

abstract = {During behavioral quiescence, the neocortex generates spontaneous slow oscillations that consist of Up and Down states. Up states are short epochs of persistent activity that resemble the activated neocortex during arousal and cognition. Although Up states are generated within the cortex, the impact of extrinsic (thalamocortical) and intrinsic (intracortical) inputs on the persistent activity is not known. Using thalamocortical slices, we found that the persistent cortical activity during spontaneous Up states effectively drives thalamocortical relay cells through corticothalamic connections. However, thalamic activity can also precede the onset of cortical Up states, which suggests a role of thalamic activity in triggering cortical Up states through thalamocortical connections. In support of this hypothesis, we found that cutting the connections between thalamus and cortex reduced the incidence of spontaneous Up states in the cortex. Consistent with a facilitating role of thalamic activity on Up states, electrical or chemical stimulation of the thalamus triggered cortical Up states very effectively and enhanced those occurring spontaneously. In contrast, stimulation of the cortex triggered Up states only at very low intensities but otherwise had a suppressive effect on Up states. Moreover, cortical stimulation suppressed the facilitating effect of thalamic stimulation on Up states. In conclusion, thalamocortical inputs facilitate and intracortical inputs suppress cortical Up states. Thus, extrinsic and intrinsic cortical inputs differentially regulate persistent activity, which may serve to adjust the processing state of thalamocortical networks during behavior.},

A simplified model of this transformation is one in which an underlying “generator potential,” representing a measure of overall neuronal drive, is passed through a static nonlinearity to produce an instantaneous firing rate. An important question is how adaptive mechanisms adjust the mean and SD of the generator potential to define an “operating point” that controls spike generation. In early sensory pathways adaptation has been shown to rescale the generator potential to maximize the amount of transmitted information. In contrast, we demonstrate that the operating point in the cortex is tuned so that cells respond only when the generator potential executes a large excursion above its mean value. The distance from the mean of the generator potential to spike threshold is, on average, 1 SD of the ongoing activity. Signals above threshold are amplified linearly and do not reach saturation. The operating point is adjusted dynamically so that it remains relatively invariant despite changes in stimulus contrast. We conclude that the operating regimen of the cortex is suitable for the detection of signals in background noise and for enhancing the selectivity of spike responses relative to those of the generator potential (the so-called “iceberg effect”), but not to maximize the transmission of total information.},

In the cat lateral geniculate nucleus, part of this cortical feedback is mediated by type 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluR1s), which are exclusively located on distal segments of the relay-cell dendrites. Here we show that in adult cats the cortex uses a synaptic drive mediated by these receptors (mGluR1) specifically to enhance the excitatory center of the thalamic receptive field. Moreover the effect is maximum in response to those stimuli that effectively drive cortical cells, and importantly, it does not affect the spatiotemporal structure of the thalamic receptive field. Therefore, cortex, by closing this corticofugal “loop,” is able to increase the gain of its thalamic input within a focal spatial window, selecting key features of the incoming signal.},

This is traditionally viewed as a sleep-like phenomenon, with a shift to tonic mode at wake-up. However, bursts have also been seen in the wake state and may be a significant feature for full activation of recipient cortical cells. Here we show that for visual stimulation of anaesthetised cats, burst firing is restricted to a reduced area within the receptive field centre of lateral geniculate nucleus cells. Consistently, the receptive field size of all the recorded neurons decreased in size proportionally to the percentage of spikes in bursts versus tonic spikes, an effect that is further demonstrated with pharmacological manipulation. The role of this shrinkage may be distinct from that also seen in sleep-like states and we suggest that this is a mechanism that trades spatial resolution for security of information transfer.},

abstract = {Cortical motion analysis continuously encodes image velocity but might also be used to predict future patterns of sensory input along the motion path. We asked whether this predictive aspect of motion is exploited by the human visual system. Targets can be more easily detected at the leading as compared to the trailing edge of motion [1], but this effect has been attributed to a nonspecific boost in contrast gain at the leading edge, linked to motion-induced shifts in spatial position [1-4]. Here we show that the detectability of a local sinusoidal target presented at the ends of a region containing motion is phase dependent at the leading edge, but not at the trailing edge. These two observations rule out a simple gain control mechanism that modulates contrast energy and passive filtering explanations, respectively. By manipulating the relative orientation of the moving pattern and target, we demonstrate that the resulting spatial variation in detection threshold along the edge closely resembles the superposition of sensory input and an internally generated predicted signal. These findings show that motion induces a forward prediction of spatial pattern that combines with the cortical representation of the future stimulus.},

At the neuronal level, noise exclusion might result in altered spatial integration properties. We tested this proposal by recording neuronal activity and length tuning in neurons of the primary visual cortex of the macaque when attention was directed toward or away from stimuli presented in each neuron’s classical receptive field. For cells with central-parafoveal receptive fields, attention reduced spatial integration, as demonstrated by a reduction in preferred stimulus length and in the size of the spatial summation area. Conversely, in cells that represented more peripheral locations, attention increased spatial integration by increasing the cell’s summation area. This previously unknown dichotomy between central and peripheral vision could support accurate analysis of attended foveal objects and target selection for impending eye movements to peripheral objects.},

Injections of HRP into the optic radiations near the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus result in Golgi-like filling of both geniculate relay neurons and corticogeniculate axons. In the present material at least two main types of axons could be defined. The most common type is called the type I axon because it so closely resembles the type I axons described by Guillery (’66, ‘67) in Golgi preparations. These fine axons have smooth surfaces and consistent fiber diameter. Most terminal swellings are at the ends of short collateral branches and these swellings form asymmetric synaptic contacts onto small and medium-sized dendrites. Type I axons typically innervate more than one lamina as well as interlaminar zones and they clearly arise from the cerebral cortex. The second type of axon is called the beaded axon because of its numerous swellings, en passant. These swellings frequently are larger than those on type I axons and they differ from previously described corticogeniculate axon terminals in their ultrastructural features. That is, their synaptic contacts appear symmetrical and they form axosomatic contacts. Because of these differences, the possibility that beaded axons are of subcortical origin, particularly from the perigeniculate nucleus, is discussed. When type I axons and geniculate relay neurons are filled in the same region of the nucleus it is possible to identify probable sites of synaptic contact by using the light microscope. Such analyses indicate that corticogeniculate axons synapse directly onto relay cells, primarily on peripheral dendritic branches. Further, it appears that single axons contact many geniculate neurons and that single neurons are contacted by many axons.},

abstract = {The functional specificity of callosal connections was investigated in visual areas 17 and 18 of adult cats, by combining in vivo optical imaging of intrinsic signals with labeling of callosal axons. Local injections of neuronal tracers were performed in one hemisphere and eight single callosal axons were reconstructed in the opposite hemisphere. The distributions of injection sites and callosal axon terminals were analyzed with respect to functional maps in both hemispheres. Typically, each callosal axon displayed 2 or 3 clusters of synaptic boutons in layer II/III and the upper part of layer IV. These clusters were preferentially distributed in regions representing the same orientation and the same visuotopic location as that at the corresponding injection sites in the opposite hemisphere. The spatial distribution of these clusters was elongated and its main axis correlated well with the preferred orientation at the injection site. These results demonstrate a specific organization of interhemispheric axons that link cortical regions representing the same orientation and the same location of visual stimuli. Visual callosal connections are thus likely involved in the processing of coherent information in terms of shape and position along the midline of the visual field, which may facilitate the fusion of both hemifields into the percept of a single visual scene.},

Injections of anterograde tracers in anterior occipital and temporal areas, however, consistently produce labeled terminals in area V1. In order to confirm these results and display the full range of foci projecting to V1, we injected V1 in two monkeys with the retrograde tracer fast blue. Feedback connections were found, as expected, from several prestriate areas (V2, V3, V4, and MT), These originate from neurons in layers 3A and 6. Connections were also found from several more distal regions, namely, areas TEO, TE, TF, TH, and from cortex in the occipitotemporal and superior temporal (STS) sulci. Filled neurons occurred in two small foci in the caudal intraparietal sulcus. These more distal feedback connections tend to originate only from layer 6. An additional injection of the retrograde tracer diamidino yellow in area V2 of one animal revealed a similarly widespread network of feedback connections. In some areas (in the STS and in TEO), 10-15% of fluorescent neurons were double-labeled. These results indicate that feedback connections to early visual cortex derive from a widespread network of areas, including limbic-associated cortices. These connectional patterns testify to the massive recursiveness of anatomical pathways. As there are no reports of projections from V1 to anterior temporal cortices, our results also indicate that some cortical feedback connections may not be strictly reciprocal},

abstract = {A group of readily recognized amacrine cells were observed in Golgi-impregnated and flat-mounted macaque, baboon, and human retinas. These cells had roughly-circular or oval dendritic fields that were narrowly stratified within the inner plexiform layer (IPL). Most of these cells stratified in the inner half (sublamina b) of the IPL, and they had their somata in the ganglion-cell layer; a few stratified in the outer half (sublamina a) of the IPL and had their somata in the amacrine-cell layer. Typically, a single dendrite issued from the soma, and, after passing for 10 microns or so, gave rise to five or more radiate processes. As these processes neared the edge of the dendritic field they branched, turned, and became varicose. Most showed no evidence of an axon, although a few had a short process extending inward, toward the optic-fiber layer. Dendritic-field diameters were about 100 microns near the fovea and increased to about 350 microns in the peripheral retina. Mean somal diameter also increased slightly from near the fovea (7.8 microns) to the periphery (8.7 microns). Although the primate cells are smaller, and there are some minor differences in the form of the dendritic fields, these cells appear to be morphologically equivalent to the starburst amacrines of the rabbit retina, whose counterparts have also been observed in the retinas of rats and cats. Presuming that these cells correspond to the choline acetyltransferase immunoreactive primate cells described by Mariani and Hersh (J. Comp. Neurol. 267:269-280, ‘87), their overlap factor is about ten for the type whose somata lay in the ganglion-cell layer and about 0.25 for those whose somata lay in the amacrine-cell layer.},

This review captures our current knowledge of V4, largely derived from electrophysiological and imaging studies in the macaque monkey. Based on recent discovery of functionally specific domains in V4, we propose that the unifying function of V4 circuitry is to enable selective extraction of specific functional domain-based networks, whether it be by bottom-up specification of object features or by top-down attentionally driven selection.},

However, it is unknown if working memories influence spiking activity in the primary visual cortex. To address this question, we recorded neuronal activity in the primary visual cortex of monkeys trained to perform attentional and working memory tasks with a probe that records activity in all the cortical layers. We found a consistent working memory trace in the spiking activity in the superficial and deep layers of monkey V1, and only a weak memory representation in input layer 4. This V1 memory trace could be disrupted with a visual mask, but it then quickly recovered. The advantage of the laminar probe is that is also gives insight into the current-source density, which reveals the putative synaptic sources of memory activity. The current-source density measurements revealed a characteristic signature of feedback processing with putative synaptic inputs in the superficial and deep layers for working memory. This signature resembles the signature of selective attention, supporting the view that top-down modulation of activity in primary visual cortex underlies both working memory and attention. Our results provide new insights into the role of early visual cortex in working memory.},

Here we test these theories by recording from the primary visual cortex (area V1) of monkeys. We demonstrate that the V1 neurons first register the features (at a latency of 48 ms), then segregate figures from the background (after 57 ms), and finally select relevant figures over irrelevant ones (after 137 ms). We conclude that the psychological processing stages map onto distinct time episodes that unfold in the visual cortex after the presentation of a new stimulus, so that area V1 may contribute to all these processing steps.},

This stimulus is formed by adjacent fields of black and white spots, which flicker in counterphase at 15 Hz, on a uniform gray field. Although subjects can not discriminate the temporal phase relationship between the fields of spots, they can, nevertheless see a “Phantom Contour” separating the two indiscriminable fields. The surface characteristics (temporal phase relationship of the spots) can only be seen when the stimulus is significantly slower (flicker < 7 Hz). In addition, phantom contours disappear with equiluminant spots but can be seen with very low contrast spots (< 10% contrast), and are enhanced with peripheral viewing. Taken together, the results suggest that the fast contour-extracting system may be the magnocellular system or a magno-recipient area. Implications for a stimulus which could isolate a contour extracting system, or a magno-recipient area are discussed.},

Both perceptual and cognitive processes have been proposed to explain these spontaneous inferences, but without decisive evidence one way or the other, the question remains wide open. Here, we address this long-standing debate using visual adaptation-a powerful tool to uncover neural populations that specialize in the analysis of specific visual features. After prolonged viewing of causal collision events called “launches”, subsequently viewed events were judged more often as noncausal. These negative aftereffects of exposure to collisions are spatially localized in retinotopic coordinates, the reference frame shared by the retina and visual cortex. They are not explained by adaptation to other stimulus features and reveal visual routines in retinotopic cortex that detect and adapt to cause and effect in simple collision stimuli.},

This intermediate level of recordings should help to bridge the gap between multiunit and scalp recordings. Both averaged and single-trial responses to small flashed stimuli, for which we varied the retinotopic position, the luminance and the color, were analyzed in the time-frequency domain using a wavelet-based decomposition of the signal. Large gamma oscillations (40-55 Hz), not phase locked to stimulus onset, were observed during the whole stimulus presentation, whereas visual evoked potentials (VEPs) were present mainly at stimulus onset and offset. Cortical mapping showed that both activities were restricted in spatial extent and followed the retinotopic organization of area V1 on the operculum, thus strongly suggesting they were generated in the underlying cortex. Oscillatory burst detection in single trials showed that one to two bursts lasting from 100 ms to 500 ms occurred in the first 500 ms following stimulus onset, and that bursts occurring during the subsequent phases of the response had a smaller amplitude and duration. Finally, we showed that gamma activity was stronger with higher luminances and for red than for green, yellow, or white stimuli of same luminance. In one animal we recorded gamma activity over area V4. This was of lower magnitude than the activity recorded over V1 and was delayed by 40 ms with respect to the beginning of gamma activity in V1, in contrast with the VEPs that were delayed by 20 ms only. Both gamma oscillations and early VEP followed the retinotopic organization of V4 over the prelunate gyrus. The results show that gamma oscillations are dependent upon the same parameters as the VEPs (retinotopic position, luminance, and color). However, the differences in the time course of VEPs and gamma activity (transient vs. sustained) suggests that these two responses may reflect different cell populations, different networks, or different firing modes.},

During learning these neurons become tuned to relevant features and start to represent them with persistent activity during memory delays. This learning process is not well understood. Here we develop a biologically plausible learning scheme that explains how trial-and-error learning induces neuronal selectivity and working memory representations for task-relevant information. We propose that the response selection stage sends attentional feedback signals to earlier processing levels, forming synaptic tags at those connections responsible for the stimulus-response mapping. Globally released neuromodulators then interact with tagged synapses to determine their plasticity. The resulting learning rule endows neural networks with the capacity to create new working memory representations of task relevant information as persistent activity. It is remarkably generic: it explains how association neurons learn to store task-relevant information for linear as well as non-linear stimulus-response mappings, how they become tuned to category boundaries or analog variables, depending on the task demands, and how they learn to integrate probabilistic evidence for perceptual decisions.},

abstract = {Evidence of multisensory interactions within low-level cortices and at early post-stimulus latencies [1-6] has prompted a paradigm shift in conceptualizations of sensory organization [7-10]. However, the mechanisms of these interactions and their link to behavior remain largely unknown. One behaviorally salient stimulus is a rapidly approaching (looming) object, which can indicate potential threats [11-13]. Based on findings from humans [14] and nonhuman primates [15, 16] suggesting there to be selective multisensory (auditory-visual) integration of looming signals, we tested whether looming sounds would selectively modulate the excitability of visual cortex. We combined transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS) over the occipital pole and psychophysics for “neurometric” and psychometric assays of changes in low-level visual cortex excitability (i.e., phosphene induction) and perception, respectively [17, 18]. Across three experiments we show that structured looming sounds considerably enhance visual cortex excitability relative to other sound categories and white-noise controls. The time course of this effect showed that modulation of visual cortex excitability started to differ between looming and stationary sounds for sound portions of very short duration (80 ms) that were significantly below (by 35 ms) perceptual discrimination threshold. Visual perceptions are thus rapidly and efficiently boosted by sounds through early, preperceptual and stimulus-selective modulation of neuronal excitability within low-level visual cortex.},

abstract = {We have recorded single-neuron activity from cytoarchitectonic area 18 of anesthetized (0.4–0.7% isoflurane in 65% N2O-35% O2 gaseous mixture) domestic cats. Neurons were identified as simple or complex on the basis of the ratios between the phase-variant (F1) component and the mean firing rate (F0) of spike responses to optimized (orientation, direction, spatial and temporal frequencies, size) high-contrast, luminance-modulated, sine-wave drifting gratings (simple: F1/F0 spike-response ratios > 1; complex: F1/F0 spike-response ratios < 1). The predominance (∼80%) of simple cells among the neurons recorded from the principal thalamorecipient layers supports the idea that most simple cells in area 18 might constitute a putative early stage in the visual information processing. Apart from the “spike-generating” regions (the classical receptive fields, CRFs), the receptive fields of three-quarters of area 18 neurons contain silent, extraclassical suppressive regions (ECRFs). The spatial extent of summation areas of excitatory responses was negatively correlated with the strength of the ECRF-induced suppression of spike responses. Lowering the stimulus contrast resulted in an expansion of the summation areas of excitatory responses accompanied by a reduction in the strength of the ECRF-induced suppression. The spatial and temporal frequency and orientation tunings of the ECRFs were much broader than those of the CRFs. Hence, the ECRFs of area 18 neurons appear to be largely “inherited” from their dorsal thalamic inputs. In most area 18 cells, costimulation of CRFs and ECRFs resulted in significant increases in F1/F0 spike-response ratios, and thus there was a contextually modulated functional continuum between the simple and complex cells.},

The optimal combination of responses is determined both by their dependence on the sensory stimulus and by their cofluctuations across trials-that is, the noise correlations. Positively correlated noise is considered deleterious, because it limits the coding accuracy of populations of similarly tuned neurons. However, positively correlated fluctuations between differently tuned neurons actually increase coding accuracy, because they allow the common noise to be subtracted without signal loss. This is demonstrated with data recorded from the secondary somatosensory cortex of monkeys performing a vibrotactile discrimination task. The results indicate that positive correlations are not always harmful and may be exploited by cortical networks to enhance the neural representation of features to be discriminated},

Excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) were considered monosynaptic (thalamocortical) if they met three criteria: low onset latency variability (jitter), little change in latency with increased stimulus intensity, and little change in latency during a high-frequency tetanus. Thalamocortical EPSPs were reliable (probability of postsynaptic responses to stimulation was approximately 1.0) as well as temporally precise (low jitter). Both RS and FS neurons received thalamocortical input, but EPSPs in FS cells had faster rise times, shorter latencies to peak amplitude, and shorter durations than EPSPs in RS cells. Thalamocortical EPSPs depressed during repetitive stimulation at rates (2-300 Hz) consistent with thalamic spike rates in vivo, but at stimulation rates &gt; or = 40 Hz, EPSPs also summed to activate N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors and trigger long-lasting polysynaptic activity. We conclude that thalamic inputs to excitatory and inhibitory neurons in ACx activate reliable and temporally precise monosynaptic EPSPs that in vivo may contribute to the precise timing of acoustic-evoked responses.},

Determining which nonlinear operations are implemented by neural systems is crucial to understanding sensory processing. Here, we ask if demodulation, the process used to decode AM radio signals, describes how Y cells in the cat LGN nonlinearly encode the visual scene. In response to visual AM signals across a wide range of carrier frequencies, Y cells were found to transmit a demodulated signal, with the firing rate of single-units fluctuating at the envelope frequency but not the carrier frequency. A comparison of temporal frequency tuning properties between LGN Y cells and neurons in two primary cortical areas suggests that Y cells initiate a distinct pathway that carries a demodulated representation of the visual scene to cortex. The nonlinear signal processing carried out by the Y cell pathway simplifies the neural representation of complex visual features and allows high spatiotemporal frequencies to drive cortical responses.},

To assess the reciprocal functional connectivity between PuM and cortex, we studied intracerebral-evoked responses obtained after PuM and cortical electrical stimulation in 7 epileptic patients undergoing depth electroencephalographic recordings. Cortical-evoked potentials (CEPs) to PuM stimulation were recorded from all explored cortical regions, except striate cortex, anterior cingulated, and postcentral gyrus. Percentages of cortical contacts pairs responding to PuM stimulation (CEPs response rate) ranged from 80% in temporal neocortex, temporoparietal (TP) junction, insula, and frontoparietal opercular cortex to 34% in mesial temporal regions. Reciprocally, PuM-evoked potentials (PEPs) response rates were 14% after cortical stimulation in insula and frontoparietal opercular cortex, 67% in the TP junction, 76% in temporal neocortex, and 80% in mesial temporal regions. Overall, our study of functional PuM connectivity in the human brain converges with most of the data from anatomical studies in monkeys, except for a strong amygdalohippocampal functional projection to PuM and an unexpected imbalance between some of the reciprocal pathways explored. This functional quantitative approach helps to clarify the functional role of PuM as well as its implication in temporal lobe epileptic seizures.},

In showing how to recover an approximation to Russell’s conclusion while explaining scientists’ continuing appeal to causal ideas (without violating naturalism by philosophically correcting scientists) we illustrate a general naturalist strategy for handling problems around the unification of sciences that assume different levels of naïveté with respect to folk conceptual frameworks. We do this despite rejecting one of the premises of Russell’s argument, a version of reductionism that was scientifically plausible in 1913 but is not so now.},

abstract = {Recent studies have suggested that V1 neurons extract figures from their backgrounds, in that they respond better to interior features of figures than to equivalent features of background stimuli. This is reportedly true even when the figure boundaries are distant from the borders of the classical receptive field (RF). To test the role of V1 neurons in figure-ground segregation, we recorded their responses to texture figures on texture backgrounds, centered on the RF. The texture elements of the figures remained identical across trials, and figure boundaries were defined by orientation differences between the elements in the background texture relative to elements in the figure. For nearly all neurons (98/102), responses to a large texture figure did not differ from the responses to a uniform-texture background. Although many neurons gave enhanced responses to texture boundaries, this occurred only when the boundaries were within or close to the RF borders. Similar effects were found in V2. For neurons in V1, the limited spatial extent of the contextual modulation was not increased either at low stimulus contrast or when the animal was rewarded for detecting an orientation-defined figure. Thus, V1 neurons appear to signal texture boundaries rather than figures per se. Unexpectedly, many V1 neurons gave significant long-latency responses to texture stimuli located entirely outside the classical RF, up to 5 degrees from the RF border in some cases. However, these responses did not depend on the stimulus forming a figure that contained the RF. Although V1 neurons are influenced by stimuli outside the classical RF, they do not appear to segregate figures from ground.},

abstract = {Brain imaging, electrical stimulation, and neurophysiological studies have all implicated the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in the top-down control of attention. Specifically, feedback from PFC has been proposed to bias activity in visual cortex in favor of attended stimuli over irrelevant distracters. To identify which attentional functions are critically dependent on PFC, we removed PFC unilaterally in combination with transection of the corpus callosum and anterior commissure in two macaques. In such a preparation, the ipsilesional hemisphere is deprived of top-down feedback from PFC to visual cortex, and the contralesional hemisphere can serve as an intact normal control. Monkeys were trained to fixate a central cue and discriminate the orientation of a colored target grating presented among colored distracter gratings in either the hemifield affected by the PFC lesion or the normal control hemifield. Locations of the targets and distracters were varied, and the color of the central cue specified the color of the target on each trial. The behavioral response was a bar release, and thus attentional impairments could be distinguished from impaired oculomotor control. When the cue was held constant for many trials, task performance in the affected hemifield was nearly normal. However, the monkeys were severely impaired when the cue was switched frequently across trials. The monkeys were unimpaired in a pop-out task with changing targets that did not require top-down attentional control. The PFC thus appears to play a critical role in the ability to flexibly reallocate attention on the basis of changing task demands.},

However, higher order thalamic nuclei, such as the pulvinar, interconnect with many cortical and subcortical areas, suggesting a role for the thalamus in providing sensory and behavioral context. Yet the nature of the signals conveyed to cortex by higher order thalamus remains poorly understood. Here we use axonal calcium imaging to measure information provided to visual cortex by the pulvinar equivalent in mice, the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), as well as the dorsolateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). We found that dLGN conveys retinotopically precise visual signals, while LP provides distributed information from the visual scene. Both LP and dLGN projections carry locomotion signals. However, while dLGN inputs often respond to positive combinations of running and visual flow speed, LP signals discrepancies between self-generated and external visual motion. This higher order thalamic nucleus therefore conveys diverse contextual signals that inform visual cortex about visual scene changes not predicted by the animal’s own actions.},

The present study examined the contribution of spike count and spike timing to the discrimination of stimuli that evoke the same taste quality but are of different chemical composition. Responses to between 3 and 21 repeated presentations of two pairs of quality-matched tastants were recorded from 38 single cells in the NTS of urethane-anesthetized rats. Temporal coding was assessed in 24 cells, most of which were tested with salty and sour tastants, using an information-theoretic approach. Within a given cell, responses to tastants of similar quality were generally closer in magnitude than responses to dissimilar tastants; however, tastants of similar quality often reversed their order of effectiveness across replicate sets of trials. Typically, discrimination between tastants of dissimilar qualities could be made by spike count. Responses to tastants of similar quality typically evoked more similar response magnitudes but were more frequently, and to a proportionally greater degree, distinguishable based on temporal information. Results showed that nearly every taste-responsive NTS cell has the capacity to generate temporal features in evoked spike trains that can be used to distinguish between stimuli of different qualities and chemical compositions.},

Among 26 neuronal trios, we found that thalamocortical efficacy after synchronous thalamic activity was nearly twice as large as the efficacy rate obtained when pairs of thalamic neurons discharged asynchronously. Nearly half of these neuronal trios displayed cooperative effects in which the cortical discharge probability after synchronous thalamic events was larger than could be predicted from the efficacy rate of individual thalamic discharges. In these cases of heterosynaptic cooperativity, thalamocortical efficacy declined to asymptotic levels when the interspike intervals were >6-8 msec. These results indicate that thalamic synchronization has a significant impact on cortical responsiveness and suggest that neuronal synchronization may play a critical role in the transmission of sensory information from one brain region to another.},

Cross-correlation functions between pairs of spike trains in the second somatosensory cortex (SII) of three macaque monkeys trained to switch attention between a visual task and a tactile task were computed. We previously showed that the majority of recorded neuron pairs (66%) in SII cortex fire synchronously while the animals performed either task and that in a subset of neuron pairs (17%), the degree of synchrony was affected by the animal’s attentional state. Of the neuron pairs that showed changes in synchrony with attention, about 80% showed increased synchrony when the animal attended to the tactile stimulus. Here, we show that peak correlation typically occurred at a delay &lt;25 ms; most commonly the delay was close to zero. Half-widths of the correlation peaks were distributed between a few milliseconds and hundreds of milliseconds, with the majority lying &lt;100 ms and the mode of the distribution around 20-30 ms. Maximal change in synchrony occurred mainly during the periods when the stimulus was present, and synchrony usually increased when attention was on the tactile stimulus. If periods of elevated firing rates around the motor response times were removed from the analysis, the percentage of pairs that changed the degree of synchrony with attention more than doubled (from 35 to 72%).

These circuits could be activated-in ways that reveal circuit function or restore function after disease-by an artificial stimulation system that is capable of independently driving local groups of neurons. Here we present a simple custom microscope called ProjectorScope 1 that incorporates off-the-shelf parts and a liquid crystal display (LCD) projector to stimulate surface brain regions that express channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2). In principle, local optogenetic stimulation of the brain surface with optical projection systems might not produce local activation of a highly interconnected network like the cortex, because of potential stimulation of axons of passage or extended dendritic trees. However, here we demonstrate that the combination of virally mediated ChR2 expression levels and the light intensity of ProjectorScope 1 is capable of producing local spatial activation with a resolution of ∼200-300 μm. We use the system to examine the role of cortical activity in the experience-dependent emergence of motion selectivity in immature ferret visual cortex. We find that optogenetic cortical activation alone-without visual stimulation-is sufficient to produce increases in motion selectivity, suggesting the presence of a sharpening mechanism that does not require precise spatiotemporal activation of the visual system. These results demonstrate that optogenetic stimulation can sculpt the developing brain.},

Excitatory input to apical tufts in neocortical layer 1 has been traditionally assumed to be predominantly cortical, as thalamic pathways directed to this layer were regarded relatively scant and diffuse. However, the sensitive tracing methods used in the present study show that, throughout the rat neocortex, large numbers (mean approximately 4500/mm(2)) of thalamocortical neurons converge in layer 1 and that this convergence gives rise to a very high local density of thalamic terminals. Moreover, we show that the layer 1-projecting neurons are present in large numbers in most, but not all, motor, association, limbic, and sensory nuclei of the rodent thalamus. Some layer 1-projecting axons branch to innervate large swaths of the cerebral hemisphere, whereas others arborize within only a single cortical area. Present data imply that realistic modeling of cortical circuitry should factor in a dense axonal canopy carrying highly convergent thalamocortical input to pyramidal cell apical tufts. In addition, they are consistent with the notion that layer 1-projecting axons may be a robust anatomical substrate for extensive “feedback” interactions between cortical areas via the thalamus.},

abstract = {Optogenetics combines optics and genetics to control neuronal activity with cell-type specificity and millisecond temporal precision. Its use in model organisms such as rodents, Drosophila, and Caenorhabditis elegans is now well-established. However, application of this technology in nonhuman primates (NHPs) has been slow to develop. One key challenge has been the delivery of viruses and light to the brain through the thick dura mater of NHPs, which can only be penetrated with large-diameter devices that damage the brain. The opacity of the NHP dura prevents visualization of the underlying cortex, limiting the spatial precision of virus injections, electrophysiological recordings, and photostimulation. Here, we describe a new optogenetics approach in which the native dura is replaced with an optically transparent artificial dura. This artificial dura can be penetrated with fine glass micropipettes, enabling precisely targeted injections of virus into brain tissue with minimal damage to cortex. The expression of optogenetic agents can be monitored visually over time. Most critically, this optical window permits targeted, noninvasive photostimulation and concomitant measurements of neuronal activity via intrinsic signal imaging and electrophysiological recordings. We present results from both anesthetized-paralyzed (optical imaging) and awake-behaving NHPs (electrophysiology). The improvements over current methods made possible by the artificial dura should enable the widespread use of optogenetic tools in NHP research, a key step toward the development of therapies for neuropsychiatric and neurological diseases in humans.},

abstract = {Sharpness of vision depends on the resolution of details conveyed by individual neurons in the visual pathway. In the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), the neurons have receptive fields with center-surround organization, and spatial resolution may be measured as the inverse of center size. We studied dynamics of receptive field center size of single LGN neurons during the response to briefly (400-500 ms) presented static light or dark spots. Center size was estimated from a series of spatial summation curves made for successive 5-ms intervals during the stimulation period. The center was wide at the start of the response, but shrank rapidly over 50-100 ms after stimulus onset, whereupon it widened slightly. Thereby, the spatial resolution changed from coarse-to-fine with average peak resolution occurring approximately 70 ms after stimulus onset. The changes in spatial resolution did not follow changes of firing rate; peak firing appeared earlier than the maximal spatial resolution. We suggest that the response initially conveys a strong but spatially coarse message that might have a detection and tune-in function, followed by transient transmission of spatially precise information about the stimulus. Experiments with spots presented inside the maximum but outside the minimum center width suggested a dynamic reduction in number of responding neurons during the stimulation; from many responding neurons initially when the field centers are large to fewer responding neurons as the centers shrink. Thereby, there is a change from coarse-to-fine also in the recruitment of responding neurons during brief static stimulation.},

Indeed the goal of any theory of visual function is a model that will predict responses to any stimulus, including natural scenes. It has, however, recently become common to take this fundamental principle one step further: trying to use photographic or cinematographic representations of natural scenes (natural stimuli) as primary probes to explore visual computations. This approach is both challenging and controversial, and we argue that this use of natural images is so fraught with difficulty that it is not useful. Traditional methods for exploring visual computations that use artificial stimuli with carefully selected properties have been and continue to be the most effective tools for visual neuroscience. The proper use of natural stimuli is to test models based on responses to these synthetic stimuli, not to replace them.},

We fit this cascade model to responses of individual MT neurons and show that it robustly predicts the separately measured responses to gratings and plaids. The model captures the full range of pattern motion selectivity found in MT. Cells that signal pattern motion are distinguished by having convergent excitatory input from V1 cells with a wide range of preferred directions, strong motion opponent suppression and a tuned normalization that may reflect suppressive input from the surround of V1 cells.},

This analysis reveals an unsuspected richness of neuronal computation within V1. Specifically, simple and complex cell responses are best described using more linear filters than the one or two found in standard models. Many filters revealed by the model contribute suppressive signals that appear to have a predominantly divisive influence on neuronal firing. Suppressive signals are especially potent in direction-selective cells, where they reduce responses to stimuli moving in the nonpreferred direction.},

abstract = {Learning from novel experiences is a major task of the central nervous system. In mammals, the medial temporal lobe is crucial for this rapid form of learning1. The modification of synapses and neuronal circuits through plasticity is thought to underlie memory formation2. The induction of synaptic plasticity is favoured by coordinated action-potential timing across populations of neurons3. Such coordinated activity of neural populations can give rise to oscillations of different frequencies, recorded in local field potentials. Brain oscillations in the theta frequency range (3‚Äì8 Hz) are often associated with the favourable induction of synaptic plasticity as well as behavioural memory4. Here we report the activity of single neurons recorded together with the local field potential in humans engaged in a learning task. We show that successful memory formation in humans is predicted by a tight coordination of spike timing with the local theta oscillation. More stereotyped spiking predicts better memory, as indicated by higher retrieval confidence reported by subjects. These findings provide a link between the known modulation of theta oscillations by many memory-modulating behaviours and circuit mechanisms of plasticity.},

We mapped pulvino-cortical networks within the visual system, using diffusion tensor imaging, and simultaneously recorded spikes and field potentials from these interconnected network sites in monkeys performing a visuospatial attention task. The pulvinar synchronized activity between interconnected cortical areas according to attentional allocation, suggesting a critical role for the thalamus not only in attentional selection but more generally in regulating information transmission across the visual cortex.},

When the monkey selectively attended to a location, the timing of activities in the two regions became synchronized, with the parietal cortex leading the medial temporal area.

abstract = {In the primary visual cortex (V1), the responses of neurons to stimuli presented in their classical receptive fields (CRFs) are modulated by another stimulus concurrently presented in their surround (receptive field surround, SRF). We studied the nature of the modulatory effects of SRF stimulation with respect to stimulus contrast in cat V1. In 51 V1 neurons studied, large SRF stimuli (40 degreesx30 degrees) induced only the suppression of responses to CRF stimulation and the suppressive effects became stronger as the contrast for SRF stimulation increased. The contrast sensitivity of SRF suppression did not correlate with that of CRF responses. By independently controlling contrast of CRF and SRF stimuli, we studied whether SRF effects vary with CRF response magnitude. Increasing contrast for CRF stimulation caused an upward shift of the range of effective contrasts for SRF stimulation, indicating that a high contrast for SRF stimulation is required for suppressing strong responses to CRF stimulation at high contrasts. To assess the possible origin of the suppressive SRF effect on V1 neurons, we also investigated the contrast dependency of SRF effects in 28 neurons from the lateral geniculate nucleus. Our results suggest that SRF effects obtained at the subcortical level strongly contribute to those in V1. Taken together, we conclude that along the thalamocortical projections, SRF modulation exhibits a gain-control mechanism that scales the suppressive SRF effect depending on the contrast for CRF stimulation. In addition, SRF effects can be facilitatory at low stimulus contrasts potentially due to the enlargement of the summation field.},

Thus, MT+ developed motion-specific responses to nonvisual input, suggesting that cross-modal plasticity can be influenced by the normal functional specialization of a cortical region. Regarding sight recovery after early blindness, our results further demonstrate that cross-modal responses coexist with regained visual responses within the visual cortex.},

abstract = {Neuronal responses to sensory stimuli are not only driven by feedforward sensory pathways but also depend upon intrinsic factors (collectively known as the network state) that include ongoing spontaneous activity and neuromodulation. To understand how these factors together regulate cortical dynamics, we recorded simultaneously spontaneous and somatosensory-evoked multiunit activity from primary somatosensory cortex and from the locus coeruleus (LC) (the neuromodulatory nucleus releasing norepinephrine) in urethane-anesthetized rats. We found that bursts of ipsilateral-LC firing preceded by few tens of milliseconds increases of cortical excitability, and that the 1- to 10-Hz rhythmicity of LC discharge appeared to increase the power of delta-band (1-4 Hz) cortical synchronization. To investigate quantitatively how LC firing might causally influence spontaneous and stimulus-driven cortical dynamics, we then constructed and fitted to these data a model describing the dynamical interaction of stimulus drive, ongoing synchronized cortical activity, and noradrenergic neuromodulation. The model proposes a coupling between LC and cortex that can amplify delta-range cortical fluctuations, and shows how suitably timed phasic LC bursts can lead to enhanced cortical responses to weaker stimuli and increased temporal precision of cortical stimulus-evoked responses. Thus, the temporal structure of noradrenergic modulation may selectively and dynamically enhance or attenuate cortical responses to stimuli. Finally, using the model prediction of single-trial cortical stimulus-evoked responses to discount single-trial state-dependent variability increased by ∼70% the sensory information extracted from cortical responses. This suggests that downstream circuits may extract information more effectively after estimating the state of the circuit transmitting the sensory message.},

abstract = {Synchronized firing among neurons in the working brain is inferred to reflect coding by cell assemblies, which dynamically change their sizes and functional connections to encode various information. It therefore follows that, if synchronized firing reflects cell-assembly coding, it should show dynamic changes that depend on the tasks and events being processed and on the distance between the neurons. By using unique spike-sorting and multi-neuronal recording methods, we investigated such dynamics of synchrony in the prefrontal cortex of monkeys while they were successively performing two tasks in which working memory for either stimulus duration or color was required. Forty-eight percent of 1405 neuronal pairs showed firing synchrony during the performance of the tasks. Almost half of such neuronal pairs showed fixed synchrony and constantly fired together in both tasks. However, some neuronal pairs showed task-dependent synchrony that appeared in only one of the tasks. Moreover, the other neuronal pairs showed event-task-dependent synchrony that appeared during stimulus or retention periods in the tasks, but the periods showing synchrony varied between the tasks. Fixed synchrony and task-dependent synchrony were mostly observed among neighboring neurons and showed little variation of spike timings; the event-task-dependent synchrony, in contrast, was more often detected among distant neurons with larger variation of spike timings than the other two types of synchrony. These results suggest that some closely neighboring neurons have dynamic and sharp synchrony to represent certain situations (tasks), whereas some distant neurons show more dynamic and unstable synchronous firing to represent quickly changing events being processed in working memory.},

What determines the shapes of tuning curves in a neuronal population? Previous theoretical studies and related experiments suggest that many response characteristics of sensory neurons are optimal for encoding stimulus-related information. This notion, however, does not explain the two general types of tuning profiles that are commonly observed: unimodal and monotonic. Here I quantify the efficacy of a set of tuning curves according to the possible downstream motor responses that can be constructed from them. Curves that are optimal in this sense may have monotonic or nonmonotonic profiles, where the proportion of monotonic curves and the optimal tuning-curve width depend on the general properties of the target downstream functions. This dependence explains intriguing features of visual cells that are sensitive to binocular disparity and of neurons tuned to echo delay in bats. The numerical results suggest that optimal sensory tuning curves are shaped not only by stimulus statistics and signal-to-noise properties but also according to their impact on downstream neural circuits and, ultimately, on behavior.},

abstract = {ENG JOURNAL ARTICLE Cortical neurons are typically driven by thousands of synaptic inputs. The arrival of a spike from one input may or may not be correlated with the arrival of other spikes from different inputs. How does this interdependence alter the probability that the postsynaptic neuron will fire? We constructed a simple random walk model in which the membrane potential of a target neuron fluctuates stochastically, driven by excitatory and inhibitory spikes arriving at random times. An analytic expression was derived for the mean output firing rate as a function of the firing rates and pairwise correlations of the inputs. This stochastic model made three quantitative predictions. (1) Correlations between pairs of excitatory or inhibitory inputs increase the fluctuations in synaptic drive, whereas correlations between excitatory-inhibitory pairs decrease them. (2) When excitation and inhibition are fully balanced (the mean net synaptic drive is zero), firing is caused by the fluctuations only. (3) In the balanced case, firing is irregular. These theoretical predictions were in excellent agreement with simulations of an integrate-and-fire neuron that included multiple conductances and received hundreds of synaptic inputs. The results show that, in the balanced regime, weak correlations caused by signals shared among inputs may have a multiplicative effect on the input-output rate curve of a postsynaptic neuron, i.e. they may regulate its gain; in the unbalanced regime, correlations may increase firing probability mainly around threshold, when output rate is low; and in all cases correlations are expected to increase the variability of the output spike train Computational Neurobiology Laboratory, Howard Hughes Medical Institute, The Salk Institute for Biological Studies, La Jolla, California 92037, and Department of Biology, University of California at San Diego, La Jolla, California 92093.

abstract = {Previous work from this laboratory has indicated that postsynaptic mGlu1 receptors are present in the rat thalamus and may contribute to corticothalamic input [1]. The availability of positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) for mGlu1 such as Ro67-4853 [2] offers the possibility of selective potentiation of mGlu1-mediated responses. However, the effect of such potentiation has not been evaluated in vivo. Thus we have evaluated Ro67-4853 effects on responses of ventrobasal thalamus (VB) neurons to sensory stimuli and glutamate receptor agonists.
Extracellular recordings were made in vivo with multi-barrel iontophoretic electrodes from single neurons in the VB of urethane-anaesthetized male adult Wistar rats (205-450g) [3]. Procedures were Home Office (UK) approved and accorded with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. Iontophoretic application of Ro67-4853 was found to potentiate responses to iontophoretic application of the Group I mGlu agonist DHPG (to 264±27% of control responses), consistent with our previous finding that thalamic DHPG responses are mediated primarily via mGlu1 receptors [3]. Furthermore, potentiation of DHPG responses by Ro67-4853 was inversely correlated with the magnitude of the initial responses to DHPG. It is important to note that the PAM did not significantly affect responses to NMDA and that vehicle control ejections had no significant effect on either DHPG or NMDA responses. Sensory responses of VB neurons were evoked by 10-20ms air jets directed at single vibrissae so as to produce a single deflection. Short-latency responses (<50ms) to single vibrissa stimuli were not affected by Ro67-4853, but when repetitive (10Hz) stimulation was maintained for 500-1000ms, responses were potentiated (to 125±6% of control responses) by co-application of Ro67-4853. Such potentiations were prevented by co-application of the mGlu1-selective orthosteric antagonist, LY367385.
These results show that Ro67-4853 can act in vivo as a PAM to potentiate activation of mGlu1 receptors. Furthermore, these findings reveal a contribution of mGlu1 receptors to VB neuron responses to vibrissa stimulation that is recruited upon repetitive stimulation of the sensory pathway and may in part be mediated via corticothalamic feedback.

abstract = {Metabotropic glutamate subtype 1 (mGlu1) receptor is thought to play a role in synaptic responses in thalamic relay nuclei. The aim of this study was to evaluate the positive allosteric modulator (PAM) Ro67-4853 as a tool to modulate thalamic mGlu1 receptors on single thalamic neurones in vivo. Ro67-4853, applied by iontophoresis onto ventrobasal thalamus neurones of urethane-anaesthetised rats, selectively enhanced responses to the agonist (S)-3,5-dihydroxy-phenylglycine (DHPG), an effect consistent with mGlu1 potentiation. The PAM was also able to enhance maintained responses to 10 Hz trains of sensory stimulation of the vibrissae, but had little effect on responses to single sensory stimuli. Thus Ro67-4853 appears to be a highly selective tool that can be useful in investigating how mGlu1 receptor potentiation can alter neural processing in vivo. Our results show the importance of mGlu1 in sensory processing and attention mechanisms at the thalamic level and suggest that positive modulation of mGlu1 receptors might be a useful mechanism for enhancing cognitive and attentional processes.},

abstract = {We have previously shown that postsynaptic mGlu1 receptors are present in the rat thalamus, and that the mGlu1 PAM Ro67-4853 is able to potentiate such responses in vivo, thus providing a novel means of selectively enhancing mGlu1-mediated synaptic components (Salt etal. 2012). We have now investigated the effect of potentiating mGlu1 receptors on responses of thalamic neurones to noxious sensory stimulation.
Extracellular recordings were made in vivo with multi-barrel iontophoretic electrodes from single neurones in the thalamus of urethane-anaesthetized male adult Wistar rats (205-450g). Procedures were Home Office (UK) approved and accorded with the Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986. In agreement with our previous findings, responses to iontophoretic applications of the Group I mGlu agonist DHPG were selectively potentiated (compared to other glutamate receptor agonists) by co-application of Ro67-4853 to 302±64% of control responses (mean ± s.e.m.) whereas they were selectively reduced upon co-application of the mGlu1 receptor orthosteric antagonist LY367385 to 6±5% of control responses. This indicates that thalamic DHPG responses are mediated primarily via mGlu1 receptors, consistent with the high postsynaptic levels of this receptor in the thalamus. Furthermore, potentiation of DHPG responses by Ro67-4853 appeared to be greater when the initial DHPG response was of a low magnitude. Applications of Ro67-4853 were found to potentiate responses of thalamic neurones to noxious stimulation (52C, applied to either the tail or contralateral hindpaw) to 247±99% of control values (n=6), whilst having little effect on the baseline activity of nociceptive neurones. By contrast, nociceptive responses were reduced to 33±6% of control values (n=9) by concurrent application of LY367385. In a further series of experiments we found that cooling of S1 cortex resulted in a reduction of thalamic nociceptive responses to 14±8% of control values (n=5).
These results underline the importance of mGlu1 receptors in the processing of sensory information in the thalamus, particularly with respect to nociceptive responses. Furthermore, the involvement of mGlu1 receptors may reflect the activity of descending cortico-thalamic afferents from S1.},

The metric distance information confirms fundamental coding differences for discrimination between fine (10 degrees) orientation differences. The information for discriminating larger orientation differences is contained mainly in the firing rate, with minor enhancements from the coarse (30-70 ms) temporal structure in the firing rate. Both precise spike timing (9.2 ms) and intervals (6.8 ms) sustained over the stimulus presentation provide information for fine discrimination of orientation, where almost no reliable information is provided by the spike count. We compare and confirm the results (using the same data set) to vector distances based on classification theory. The results support a dynamic spiking mechanism where coordinated activity could provide fast and reliable information about detailed angle and/or direction information in the region of the preferred orientation.},

abstract = {Visual cortical cells demonstrate both oscillation and synchronization, although the underlying causes and functional significance of these behaviors remain uncertain. We simultaneously recorded single-unit activity with microelectrode arrays in supragranular layers of area 17 of cats paralyzed and anesthetized with propofol and N(2)O. Rate-normalized autocorrelograms of 24 cells reveal bursting (100%) and gamma oscillation (63%). Renewal density analysis, used to explore the source of oscillation, suggests a contribution from extrinsic influences such as feedback. However, a bursting refractory period, presumably membrane-based, could also encourage oscillatory firing. When we investigated the source of synchronization for 60 cell pairs we found only moderate correlation of synchrony with bursts and oscillation. We did, nonetheless, discover a possible functional role for oscillation. In all cases of cross-correlograms that exhibited oscillation, the strength of the synchrony was maintained throughout the stimulation period. When no oscillation was apparent, 75% of the cell pairs showed decay in their synchronization. The synchrony between cells is strongly dependent on similar response onset latencies. We therefore propose that structured input, which yields tight organization of latency, is a more likely candidate for the source of synchronization than oscillation. The reliable synchrony at response onset could be driven by spatial and temporal correlation of the stimulus that is preserved through the earlier stages of the visual system. Oscillation then contributes to maintenance of the synchrony to enhance reliable transmission of the information for higher cognitive processing.},

Analysis of joint firing yields a substantial advantage (i.e., cooperation) in fine-angle discrimination. This cooperation increases to more considerable levels as the population of an assembly is increased. The cooperation in a population of six cells provides encoding of orientation with an information advantage that is at least 2-fold in terms of requiring either fewer cells or less time than independent coding. This cooperation suggests that correlated or synchronized activity can increase information.},

Synchrony was found even between cells with wholly different orientation preferences when their receptive fields were circularly aligned, and membership in synchronous groups was orientation- and curvature-dependent. The existence of synchrony between cocircular cells reinforces its role as a general mechanism for contour integration and shape detection, as predicted by association field concepts. Our data suggest that cortical synchrony results from common and synchronous input from earlier visual areas and that it could serve to shape extrastriate response selectivity.},

abstract = {The properties of the inhibitory influence of neurons in the perigeniculate (PGN) nucleus on thalamocortical cells were examined with intracellular recordings in the ferret geniculate slice maintained in vitro. Activation of PGN neurons with the local application of glutamate caused IPSPs in thalamocortical neurons that were mediated by both GABAA and GABAB receptors, as well as the activation of spindle waves. With low intensity stimulation of the PGN, local application of bicuculline to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) strongly inhibited evoked and spindle-associated IPSPs, indicating that these are largely mediated by GABAA receptors. The generation of GABAB receptor-mediated IPSPs in thalamocortical cells that were large enough to generate rebound low threshold Ca2+ spikes required substantially increased activation of the PGN with glutamate. The activation of synchronous bicuculline-induced slowed oscillations in thalamocortical neurons required the block of GABAA receptors in the LGNd as well as in the PGN. These results indicate that bursts of action potentials in PGN neurons can result in the activation of both GABAA and GABAB receptors in thalamocortical neurons, with the strong activation of GABAB receptors requiring an intense, simultaneous discharge of a number of PGN neurons. Functionally, these results suggest that PGN neurons inhibit thalamocortical cells preferentially through the activation of GABAA receptors, although the strong activation of GABAB receptors may occur under pathological conditions and contribute to the generation of abnormal, synchronous slow oscillations.},

We did not examine the hypothalamus. The accessory optic system and the lateral posterior nucleus receive a contralateral retinal projection only and the other four regions receive a bilateral retinal projection. There is extensive binocular overlap in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. On the side contralateral to an eye injection of 3H leucine our autoradiographs show four contralateral layers which fill most of the nucleus. Three of these layers, 3, 4 and 5, also receive input from the opsilateral eye. Layer 1 which lies adjacent to the optic tract receives only contralateral retinal input. Layer 2 receives a direct retinal input only from the ipsilateral eye. The ipsilateral projection to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus forms a fairly continuous patch which is not divided into separate layers. The ipsilateral retinal input is located in the dorsal part of the lateral geniculate nucleus. The ventral quarter of the nucleus only receives a contralateral retinal input and therefore represents the monocular part of the visual field.},

Research over the past several decades has made clear that most RGCs are not merely light detectors, but rather feature detectors, which send a diverse set of parallel, highly processed images of the world on to higher centers. Here, we review progress in classification of RGCs by physiological, morphological, and molecular criteria, making a particular effort to distinguish those cell types that are definitive from those for which information is partial. We focus on the mouse, in which molecular and genetic methods are most advanced. We argue that there are around 30 RGC types and that we can now account for well over half of all RGCs. We also use RGCs to examine the general problem of neuronal classification, arguing that insights and methods from the retina can guide the classification enterprise in other brain regions.},

abstract = {It is generally assumed that sensitivity to different stimulus orientations is mapped in a globally equivalent fashion across primate visual cortex, at a spatial scale larger than that of orientation columns. However, some evidence predicts instead that radial orientations should produce higher activity than other orientations, throughout visual cortex. Here, this radial orientation bias was robustly confirmed using (1) human psychophysics, plus fMRI in (2) humans and (3) behaving monkeys. In visual cortex, fMRI activity was at least 20% higher in the retinotopic representations of polar angle which corresponded to the radial stimulus orientations (relative to tangential). In a global demonstration of this, we activated complementary retinotopic quadrants of visual cortex by simply changing stimulus orientation, without changing stimulus location in the visual field. This evidence reveals a neural link between orientation sensitivity and the cortical retinotopy, which have previously been considered independent.},

Changes in the timing of responses in the visual thalamus associated with fixational saccades are considered in this study. Activity of single neurons in alert monkey lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) was recorded during fixation while pseudorandom visual noise stimuli were presented. The position of the stimulus on the display monitor was adjusted based on eye position measurements to control for changes in retinal locations due to eye movements. A method for extracting nonstationary first-order response mechanisms was applied, so that changes around the times of saccades could be observed. Saccade-related changes were seen in both amplitude and timing of geniculate responses. Amplitudes were greatly reduced around saccades. Timing was retarded slightly during a window of about 200 ms around saccades. That is, responses became more sustained. These effects were found in both parvocellular and magnocellular neurons. Timing changes in LGN might play a role in maintaining cortical responses to visual stimuli in the presence of eye movements, compensating for the spatial shifts caused by saccades via these shifts in timing.},

abstract = {1. It has recently been shown that the X- and Y-cell classes in the A-layers of the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are divisible into lagged and nonlagged types. We have characterized the visual response properties of 153 cells in the A-layers to 1) reveal response features that are relevant to the X/Y and lagged/nonlagged classification schemes, and 2) provide a systematic description of the properties of lagged and nonlagged cells as a basis for understanding mechanisms that affect these two groups. Responses to flashing spots and drifting gratings were measured as the contrast and spatial and temporal modulation were varied. 2. X- and Y-cells were readily distinguished by their spatial tuning. Y-cells had much lower preferred spatial frequencies and spatial resolution than X-cells. Within each functional class (X or Y), however, lagged and nonlagged cells were similar in their spatial response properties. Thus the lagged/nonlagged distinction is not one related to the spatial domain. 3. In the temporal domain X- and Y-cells showed little difference in temporal tuning, whereas lagged and nonlagged cells showed distinctive response properties. The temporal tuning functions of lagged cells were slightly shifted toward lower frequencies with optimal temporal frequencies of lagged X-cells averaging an octave lower than those of nonlagged X-cells. Temporal resolution was much lower in lagged X- and Y-cells than in their nonlagged counterparts. 4. The most dramatic differences between lagged and nonlagged cells appeared in the timing of their responses, as measured by the phase of the response relative to the sinusoidal luminance modulation of a spot centered in the receptive field. Response phase varied approximately linearly with temporal frequency. The slope of the phase versus frequency line is a measure of total integration time, which we refer to as visual latency. Lagged cells has much longer latencies than nonlagged cells. 5. The intercept of the phase versus frequency line is a measure of when in the stimulus cycle the cell responds: we refer to this as the intrinsic or absolute phase of the cell. This measure of response timing not only distinguished lagged and nonlagged cells well but also covaried with the sustained or transient nature of cells’ responses to flashed stimuli},

year = {2006}, 
abstract = {The spatial summation properties of visual signals were analyzed for geniculocortical afferents in the primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized paralyzed macaque monkeys. Afferent input responses were recorded extracellularly during cortical inactivation through superfusion of the cortex with muscimol, allowing investigation of lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus (LGN) cell properties in the absence of cortical feedback. Responses from afferent inputs were classified as magno-, parvo-, or koniocellular based on anatomical organization within the cortex, established through histological reconstructions, and visual response wavelength sensitivity. More than 80% of afferents showed strong surround suppression [suppression index (SI) >0.5] and 14% showed negligible surround suppression (SI < 0.2). Afferent responses with weak and strong surround suppression were found throughout cortical input layers 4C and 4A. High-contrast estimates of the spatial extent of the classical surround were similar to the nonclassical surround. The classical and nonclassical surrounds were, on average, 1.5-fold larger than the excitatory center. Unlike neurons within V1, the spatial extent of excitatory summation for geniculocortical afferents was contrast invariant. Nonclassical surround suppression showed slight contrast dependency with estimates larger (20%) at lower contrasts and stronger at higher contrasts (13%). Surround suppression is inherent in cortical input responses and likely derives from lateral inhibition in either the LGN or retina. Although surround suppression within afferent responses increases slightly with contrast, the spatial spread of excitation remains fixed with contrast. This argues for distinct mechanisms of action for contrast-dependent modulation in cortical and subcortical responses.},

The extent of spatial summation and the magnitude of surround suppression were estimated quantitatively by analyzing the spatial summation experiments with a difference of Gaussians (DOG) model. The average extent of spatial summation is approximately the same across layers except for layer 6 cells, which tend to sum more extensively than cells in the other layers. On average, the extent of length and width summation is approximately equal. Across the population, surround suppression is greatest in layer 4B and weakest in layer 6. Estimates of summation and suppression are compared for the DOG (subtractive) model and a normalization (divisive) model. The two models yield quantitatively similar estimates of the extent of excitation and inhibition. However, the normalization (divisive) model predicts weaker surround strength than the DOG model.},

This increased AP precision occurred irrespective of cell type and--at oscillation frequencies ranging from 3 to 65 Hz--permitted accurate discernment of up to 1,000 different stimuli. At low oscillation frequencies, stimulus discrimination showed a clear phase dependence whereby inputs arriving during the trough and the early rising phase of an oscillation cycle were most robustly discriminated. Thus, by ensuring AP precision, membrane potential oscillations dramatically enhance the discriminatory capabilities of individual neurons and networks of cells and provide one attractive explanation for their abundance in neurophysiological systems.},

Neural activity was recorded in the frontal eye field, a cortical area at the interface of visual processing and eye movement production. Neurons discharging after stimulus presentation and before saccade initiation were analyzed. The initial visual response of frontal eye field neurons was modulated by the presence of multiple stimuli and by whether a saccade was going to be produced, but the initial visual response did not discriminate the target of the search array from the distractors. In the latent period before saccade initiation, the activity of most visually responsive cells evolved to signal the location of the target. Target selection occurred through suppression of distractor evoked activity contingent on the location of the target relative to the receptive field. The evolution of a signal specifying the location of the salient target could be dissociated from saccade initiation in some cells and could occur even when fixation was maintained. Neural activity in the frontal eye fields may participate in or be the product of the decision process guiding eye movements.},

In addition, behavioral tests showed motor abnormalities in the KO animals. JAM-C was also expressed in human sural nerves with an expression profile similar to that seen in mice.

abstract = {Spectral properties of 129 cells in the V4 area of 5 macaque monkeys were studied quantitatively with narrow-band and broad-band colored lights. The large majority of cells exhibited some degree of wavelength sensitivity within their receptive fields. The half-bandwidth of the primary peak in the spectral-response curve was less than 50 nm for 72% of the cells; the mean half-bandwidth of these cells, 27 nm, is similar to that found for color-opponent ganglion cells and cells in the parvocellular dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN). Contrast-response functions indicated that the narrow spectral tuning of these cells derived from cone opponent interactions. From comparison of receptive-field sizes, we suggest that a typical V4 neuron sums inputs that ultimately derive from several thousand ganglion or parvocellular dLGN cells. In spite of their wavelength sensitivity, most V4 cells had properties that would not fit some simple criteria for classification as “color selective.” First, few cells showed overt signs of color opponency, namely, on-inhibition or off-excitation to spectrally opponent wavelengths. Second, about 30% of the cells in V4 had spectral-response curves with 2 peaks. (The wavelength distribution of these second peaks was almost identical to that of primary peaks, and combinations of peak wavelengths were fairly random.) Third, most cells responded to white light; overall, the response to white light was about 60% of that to the best narrow-band or broad-band colored light. Similarly, most V4 cells gave at least a small response to all or nearly all of the different broad-band colored lights we presented. Therefore, a given V4 cell is very likely to respond to most of the colored or white surfaces in natural scenes. These combinations of response properties probably explain the widely divergent percentages of “color” cells reported in previous studies of V4. The most unusual spectral property we found in V4 was a large, spectrally sensitive surround outside the “classical receptive field” of most cells. Although stimulation of the surround by itself did not cause any response, surround stimulation could completely suppress the response to even the optimally colored stimulus in the receptive field. In general, the optimal wavelengths for receptive-field excitation and surround suppression were the same or nearly so. Thus, “color contrast” may be computed in V4. In some cases, contrasting wavelengths in the surround caused moderate enhancement of response to a receptive-field stimulus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {Functional brain imaging methods are prone to contamination from global vascular artefacts. A variety of methods have been proposed to help segment functional from non-specific changes. Here we quantify the improvement in the signal to noise ratio (SNR) of functional maps, derived from intrinsic optical imaging studies of macaque visual cortex, through the application of Extended Spatial Decorrelation (ESD). The resulting independent component maps and their corresponding time courses reveal for the first time a fast vascular component in the haemodynamic response. ESD is a blind source separation algorithm that utilises spatial statistical features in brain images to separate the recorded mixed sources into independent components. We have investigated differential and single condition experiments using a variety of visual stimuli. To calculate the improvement of the SNR in decibel (dB) we back project separated components onto the original single trial data and analyse the corresponding Fourier spectrum. The application of ESD improved SNR in the functional brain maps from 0.52 to 16.88 dB on differential imaging data and from 1.69 to 12.83 dB in the case of single condition experiments. Analysing the independent components further we found that they can separate different functional compartments of the cortical vasculature. Some of the components, classified as arterial through slit spectroscopy, revealed a strong fast response to the stimulus onset/offset starting approximately 0.2 s after the change of the stimulus and reaching a peak after approximately 0.4 s. This fast haemodynamic response raises new questions concerning the spatial specificity of the so-called “initial dip”.},

year = {1986}, 
abstract = {In the mammalian eye, the ON-centre and OFF-centre retinal ganglion cells form two major pathways projecting to central visual structures from the retina. These two pathways originate at the bipolar cell level: one class of bipolar cells becomes hyperpolarized in response to light, as do all photoreceptor cells, and the other class becomes depolarized on exposure to light, thereby inverting the receptor signal. It has recently become possible to examine the functional role of the ON-pathway in vision by selectively blocking it at the bipolar cell level using the glutamate neurotransmitter analogue 2-amino-4-phosphonobutyrate (APB)1. APB application to monkey, cat and rabbit retinas abolishes ON responses in retinal ganglion cells, the lateral geniculate nucleus and the visual cortex but has no effect on the centre-surround antagonism of OFF cells or the orientation and direction selectivities in the cortex2-5. These and related findings6-11 suggest that the ON and OFF pathways remain largely separate through the lateral geniculate nucleus and that in the cortex, contrary to some hypotheses, they are not directly involved in mechanisms giving rise to orientation and direction selectivities. We have examined the roles of the ON and OFF channels in vision in rhesus monkeys trained to do visual detection and discrimination tasks. We report here that the ON channel is reversibly blocked by injection of APB into the vitreous. Detection of light increment but not of light decrement is severely impaired, and there is a pronounced loss in contrast sensitivity. The perception of shape, colour, flicker, movement and stereo images is only mildly impaired, but longer times are required for their discrimination. Our results suggest that two reasons that the mammalian visual system has both ON and OFF channels is to yield equal sensitivity and rapid information transfer for both incremental and decremental light stimuli and to facilitate high contrast sensitivity.},

Rather, viewing distance is taken into account when determining apparent size, so images of the same physical dimensions can appear to represent different-sized objects. Here, we take advantage of this to examine the relationship between visual sensitivity and the scaling processes involved in determining apparent size. We assess the impact of illusory size changes, induced by apparent viewing distance changes, on judgments concerning clearly visible stimuli and on the ability to detect low-contrast inputs. We find that sensitivity to slight orientation changes between successive and clearly visible stimuli can scale with illusory size changes. However, illusory size changes have no discernable impact on the ability to detect low-contrast inputs. When considered in conjunction with recent brain imaging studies, our data suggest that visual sensitivity is linked to the spread of activity across primary visual cortex, which for clearly visible stimuli is shaped by the scaling processes involved in the determination of apparent size.},

abstract = {The human visual system devotes a significant proportion of its resources to a very small part of the visual field, the fovea. Foveal vision is crucial for natural behavior and many tasks in daily life such as reading or fine motor control. Despite its significant size, this part of cortex is rarely investigated and the limited data have resulted in competing models of the layout of the foveal confluence in primate species. Specifically, how V2 and V3 converge at the central fovea is the subject of debate in primates and has remained “terra incognita” in humans. Using high-resolution fMRI (1.2 x 1.2 x 1.2 mm3) and carefully designed visual stimuli, we sought to accurately map the human foveal confluence and hence disambiguate the competing theories. We find that V1, V2, and V3 are separable right into the center of the foveal confluence, and V1 ends as a rounded wedge with an affine mapping of the foveal singularity. The adjacent V2 and, in contrast to current concepts from macaque monkey, also V3 maps form continuous bands (5 mm wide) around the tip of V1. This mapping results in a highly anisotropic representation of the visual field in these areas. Unexpectedly, for the centermost 0.75¬∞, the cortical representations for both V2 and V3 are larger than that of V1, indicating that more neuronal processing power is dedicated to second-level analysis in this small but important part of the visual field.},

abstract = {Visual motion processing plays a key role in enabling primates’ successful interaction with their dynamic environments. Although in natural environments the speed of visual stimuli continuously varies, speed tuning of neurons in the prototypical motion area MT has traditionally been assessed with stimuli that moved at constant speeds. We investigated whether the representation of speed in a continuously varying stimulus context differs from the representation of constant speeds. We recorded from individual MT neurons of fixating macaques while stimuli moved either at a constant speed or in a linearly accelerating or decelerating manner. We found clear speed tuning even when the stimulus consisted of visual motion with gradual speed changes. There were, however, important differences with the speed tuning as measured with constant stimuli: the stimulus context affected neuronal preferred speed as well as the associated tuning width of the speed tuning curves. These acceleration-dependent changes in response lead to an accurate representation of the acceleration of these stimuli in the MT cells. To elucidate the mechanistic basis of this signal, we constructed a stochastic firing rate model based on the constant speed response profiles. This model incorporated each cell’s speed tuning and response adaptation dynamics and accurately predicted the response to constant speeds as well as accelerating and decelerating stimuli. Because the response of the model neurons had no explicit acceleration dependence, we conclude that speed-dependent adaptation creates a strong influence of temporal context on the MT response and thereby results in the representation of acceleration signals.},

abstract = {When analyzing a visual image, the brain has to achieve several goals quickly. One crucial goal is to rapidly detect parts of the visual scene that might be behaviorally relevant, while another one is to segment the image into objects, to enable an internal representation of the world. Both of these processes can be driven by local variations in any of several image attributes such as luminance, color, and texture. Here, focusing on texture defined by local orientation, we propose that the two processes are mediated by separate mechanisms that function in parallel. More specifically, differences in orientation can cause an object to “pop out” and attract visual attention, if its orientation differs from that of the surrounding objects. Differences in orientation can also signal a boundary between objects and therefore provide useful information for image segmentation. We propose that contextual response modulations in primary visual cortex (V1) are responsible for orientation pop-out, while a different kind of receptive field nonlinearity in secondary visual cortex (V2) is responsible for orientation-based texture segmentation. We review a recent experiment that led us to put forward this hypothesis along with other research literature relevant to this notion.},

Nonetheless, careful testing shows that certain visually guided behaviours can persist even in the absence of visual awareness1, 2, 3, 4. The neural circuits supporting this phenomenon, which is often termed blindsight, remain uncertain4. Here we demonstrate that the thalamic lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) has a causal role in V1-independent processing of visual information. By comparing functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and behavioural measures with and without temporary LGN inactivation, we assessed the contribution of the LGN to visual functions of macaque monkeys (Macaca mulatta) with chronic V1 lesions. Before LGN inactivation, high-contrast stimuli presented to the lesion-affected visual field (scotoma) produced significant V1-independent fMRI activation in the extrastriate cortical areas V2, V3, V4, V5/middle temporal (MT), fundus of the superior temporal sulcus (FST) and lateral intraparietal area (LIP) and the animals correctly located the stimuli in a detection task. However, following reversible inactivation of the LGN in the V1-lesioned hemisphere, fMRI responses and behavioural detection were abolished. These results demonstrate that direct LGN projections to the extrastriate cortex have a critical functional contribution to blindsight. They suggest a viable pathway to mediate fast detection during normal vision.},

abstract = {Segmenting the visual image into objects is a crucial stage of visual processing. Object boundaries are typically associated with differences in luminance, but discontinuities in texture also play an important role. We showed previously that a subpopulation of neurons in V2 in anesthetized macaques responds to orientation discontinuities parallel to their receptive field orientation. Such single-cell responses could be a neurophysiological correlate of texture boundary detection. Neurons in V1, on the other hand, are known to have contextual response modulations such as iso-orientation surround suppression, which also produce responses to orientation discontinuities. Here, we use pseudorandom multiregion grating stimuli of two frame durations (20 and 40 ms) to probe and compare texture boundary responses in V1 and V2 in anesthetized macaque monkeys. In V1, responses to texture boundaries were observed for only the 40 ms frame duration and were independent of the orientation of the texture boundary. However, in transient V2 neurons, responses to such texture boundaries were robust for both frame durations and were stronger for boundaries parallel to the neuron’s preferred orientation. The dependence of these processes on stimulus duration and orientation indicates that responses to texture boundaries in V2 arise independently of contextual modulations in V1. In addition, because the responses in transient V2 neurons are sensitive to the orientation of the texture boundary but those of V1 neurons are not, we suggest that V2 responses are the correlate of texture boundary detection, whereas contextual modulation in V1 serves other purposes, possibly related to orientation “pop-out.”},

Neurons in the pretectal nuclear complex that project to the ipsilateral dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd) were identified by antidromic activation after electrical LGNd stimulation in awake cats, and their response properties were characterized to retinal image shifts elicited either by external visual stimulus movements or during spontaneous saccadic eye movements on a stationary visual stimulus, and to saccades in darkness. Eye position was monitored with the use of a scleral search coil and care was taken to assure stability of the eyes during presentation of moving visual stimuli. 2. Of a total sample of 134 cells recorded, 27 neurons were antidromically activated by electrical LGNd stimulation. In addition, responses from neurons that were not activated from the LGNd were also analyzed, including 19 “retinal slip” cells, which selectively respond to slow horizontal stimulus movements, and 21 “jerk” cells, which are specifically activated by rapid stimulus shifts. All recorded neurons were located in the nucleus of the optic tract and in the posterior pretectal nucleus. 3. In the light, neurons identified as projecting to the LGNd responded maximally to saccadic eye movements and to externally generated sudden shifts of large visual stimuli. Slow stimulus drifts did not activate these neurons. Response latencies were shorter and peak activities were increased during saccades compared with pure visual stimulation. No systematic correlation between response latency, response duration, or the number of spikes in the response and saccade direction, saccade amplitude, or saccade duration was found. Saccades and rapid stimulus shifts in the light also activated jerk cells but not retinal slip cells. 4. All 27 antidromically activated neurons also responded to spontaneous saccadic eye movements in complete darkness. Responses to saccades in the dark, however, had longer response latencies and lower peak activities than responses to saccades in light. As in the light, response parameters in darkness seemed not to code specific saccade parameters. Cells that were not activated from LGNd were found to be unresponsive to saccades in the dark. 5. According to their specific activation by saccades in darkness, LGNd-projecting pretectal neurons are termed “saccade neurons” to distinguish them from other pretectal cell populations, in particular from jerk neurons, which show similar response properties in light. 6. The saccade-related activation of pretectal saccade neurons may be used to modulate visual responses of LGNd relay cells following saccadic eye movements. Because the pretectogeniculate projection in cat most likely is GABAergic and terminates on inhibitory LGNd interneurons, its activation may lead to a saccade-locked disinhibition of relay cells. This input could counter the strong inhibition induced in the LGNd after shifts of gaze direction and lead to a resetting of LGNd cell activity.},

abstract = {A highly important question in visual neuroscience is to identify where in the visual system information from different processing channels is integrated to form the complex scenery we perceive. A common view to this question is that information is processed hierarchically because small and selective receptive fields in lower visual areas melt into larger receptive fields in specialized higher visual areas. However, a higher order area in which all incoming signals ultimately converge has not yet been identified. Rather, modulation of subthreshold influences from outside the classical receptive field related to contextual integration occurs already in early visual areas. So far it is unclear how these influences are mediated (Gilbert, 1998; Angelucci and Bullier, 2003; Gilbert and Sigman, 2007). In the present study, we show that feedback connections from a higher motion processing area critically influence the integration of subthreshold global motion cues in early visual areas. Global motion cues are theoretically not discernible for a local motion detector in V1, however, imprints of pattern motion have been observed in this area (Guo et al., 2004; Schmidt et al., 2006). By combining reversible thermal deactivation and optical imaging of intrinsic signals we demonstrate that feedback signals from the posteromedial suprasylvian sulcus are critical for the discrimination between global and local motions already in early visual areas. These results suggest that global features of the visual scenery are fed back to lower visual processing units in order to facilitate the integration of local cues into a global construct.},

Identical procedures were carried out to assess latencies in each area, often in the same monkey, thereby permitting direct comparisons of timing across areas. This study presents the visual flash-evoked latencies for cells in areas where such data are common (V1 and V2), and are therefore a good standard, and also in areas where such data are sparse (LGNd M and P layers, MT, V4) or entirely lacking (V3, MST, and FEF in anesthetized preparation). Visual-evoked onset latencies were, on average, 17 ms shorter in the LGNd M layers than in the LGNd P layers. Visual responses occurred in V1 before any other cortical area. The next wave of activation occurred concurrently in areas V3, MT, MST, and FEF. Visual response latencies in areas V2 and V4 were progressively later and more broadly distributed. These differences in the time course of activation across the dorsal and ventral streams provide important temporal constraints on theories of visual processing.},

To explore this issue, I measured, during conditions of spatial or feature-based attention, activity in the human subcortical visual nuclei, which have precise retinotopic maps and are known to play important roles in the regulation of spatial attention but have limited selectivity of nonspatial features. Subjects attended to and detected changes in separate fields of moving or colored dots. When the fields were disjoint, spatially attending to one field enhanced hemodynamic responses in the superior colliculus (SC), lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), and two retinotopic pulvinar nuclei. When the two dot fields were spatially overlapping, feature-based attention to the moving versus colored dots enhanced responses in the pulvinar nuclei and the majority of the LGN, including the magnocellular layers, and suppressed activity in some areas within the parvocellular layers; the SC was inconsistently modulated among subjects. The results demonstrate that feature-based attention operates throughout the visual system by prioritizing neurons encoding the attended information, including broadly tuned thalamic neurons. I conclude that spatial and feature-based attention operate via a common principle, but that spatial location is a special feature in that it is widely encoded in the brain, is used for overt orienting, and uses a specialized structure, the SC.},

Cortical inactivation does not reduce this orientation selectivity, indicating that cortical feedback is not its source. Orientation selectivity is similar for LGN relay cells spiking and subthreshold input to V1 neurons, suggesting that cortical orientation selectivity is inherited from the LGN in mouse. In contrast, orientation selectivity of cat LGN relay cells is small relative to subthreshold inputs onto V1 simple cells. Together, these differences show that although orientation selectivity exists in visual neurons of both rodents and carnivores, its emergence along the visual pathway, and thus its underlying neuronal circuitry, is fundamentally different.},

Behavioural neurophysiological studies on dopamine neurons revealed a risk signal, which covaried with the standard deviation or variance of the magnitude of juice rewards and occurred separately from reward value coding. Human imaging studies identified similarly distinct risk signals for monetary rewards in the striatum and orbitofrontal cortex (OFC), thus fulfilling a requirement for the mean variance approach of economic decision theory. The orbitofrontal risk signal covaried with individual risk attitudes, possibly explaining individual differences in risk perception and risky decision making. Ambiguous gambles with incomplete probabilistic information induced stronger brain signals than risky gambles in OFC and amygdala, suggesting that the brain’s reward system signals the partial lack of information. The brain can use the uncertainty signals to assess the uncertainty of rewards, influence learning, modulate the value of uncertain rewards and make appropriate behavioural choices between only partly known options.},

abstract = {The responses of cortical neurons to repeated presentation of a stimulus are highly variable, yet correlated. These “noise correlations” reflect a low-dimensional structure of population dynamics. Here, we examine noise correlations in 22,705 pairs of neurons in primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized cats, during ongoing activity and in response to artificial and natural visual stimuli. We measured how noise correlations depend on 11 factors. Because these factors are themselves not independent, we distinguished their influences using a nonlinear additive model. The model revealed that five key factors play a predominant role in determining pairwise correlations. Two of these are distance in cortex and difference in sensory tuning: these are known to decrease correlation. A third factor is firing rate: confirming most earlier observations, it markedly increased pairwise correlations. A fourth factor is spike width: cells with a broad spike were more strongly correlated amongst each other. A fifth factor is spike isolation: neurons with worse isolation were more correlated, even if they were recorded on different electrodes. For pairs of neurons with poor isolation, this last factor was the main determinant of correlations. These results were generally independent of stimulus type and timescale of analysis, but there were exceptions. For instance, pairwise correlations depended on difference in orientation tuning more during responses to gratings than to natural stimuli. These results consolidate disjoint observations in a vast literature on pairwise correlations and point towards regularities of population coding in sensory cortex.},

abstract = {A key emergent property of the primary visual cortex (V1) is the orientation selectivity of its neurons. Recent experiments demonstrate remarkable bottom-up and top-down plasticity in orientation networks of the adult cortex. The basis for such dynamics is the mechanism by which orientation tuning is created and maintained, by integration of thalamocortical and intracortical inputs. Intracellular measurements of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic conductances reveal that excitation and inhibition balance each other at all locations in the cortex. This balance is particularly critical at pinwheel centers of the orientation map, where neurons receive intracortical input from a wide diversity of local orientations. The orientation tuning of neurons in adult V1 changes systematically after short-term exposure to one stimulus orientation. Such reversible physiological shifts in tuning parallel the orientation tilt aftereffect observed psychophysically. Neurons at or near pinwheel centers show pronounced changes in orientation preference after adaptation with an oriented stimulus, while neurons in iso-orientation domains show minimal changes. Neurons in V1 of alert, behaving monkeys also exhibit short-term orientation plasticity after very brief adaptation with an oriented stimulus, on the time scale of visual fixation. Adaptation with stimuli that are orthogonal to a neuron’s preferred orientation does not alter the preferred orientation but sharpens orientation tuning. Thus, successive fixation on dissimilar image patches, as happens during natural vision, combined with mechanisms of rapid cortical plasticity, actually improves orientation discrimination. Finally, natural vision involves judgements about where to look next, based on an internal model of the visual world. Experiments in behaving monkeys in which information about future stimulus locations can be acquired in one set of trials but not in another demonstrate that V1 neurons signal the acquisition of internal representations. Such Bayesian updating of responses based on statistical learning is fundamental for higher level vision, for deriving inferences about the structure of the visual world, and for the regulation of eye movements.},

abstract = {How the brain constructs a coherent representation of the environment from noisy visual input remains poorly understood. Here, we explored whether awareness of the stimulus plays a role in the integration of local features into a representation of global shape. Participants were primed with a shape defined either by position or orientation cues, and performed a shape-discrimination task on a subsequently presented probe shape. Crucially, the probe could either be defined by the same or different cues as the prime, which allowed us to distinguish the effect of priming by local features and global shape. We found a robust priming benefit for visible primes, with response times being faster when the probe and prime were the same shape, regardless of the defining cue. However, rendering the prime invisible uncovered a dissociation: position-defined primes produced behavioural benefit only for probes of the same cue type. Surprisingly, orientation-defined primes afforded an enhancement only for probes of the opposite cue. In further experiments, we showed that the effect of priming was confined to retinotopic coordinates and that there was no priming effect by invisible orientation cues in an orientation-discrimination task. This explains the absence of priming by the same cue in our shape-discrimination task. In summary, our findings show that while in the absence of awareness orientation signals can recruit retinotopic circuits (e.g. intrinsic lateral connections), conscious processing is necessary to interpret local features as global shape.},

To investigate the nature of this variability, we compared the spike activity of neurons in the primary visual cortex (V1) of cats with that of their afferents from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), in response to similar stimuli. We found variability to be much higher in V1 than in LGN. To investigate the sources of the additional variability, we measured the spiking activity of large V1 populations and found that much of the variability was shared across neurons: the variable portion of the responses of one neuron could be well predicted from the summed activity of the rest of the neurons. Variability thus mostly reflected global fluctuations affecting all neurons. The size and prevalence of these fluctuations, both in responses to stimuli and in ongoing activity, depended on cortical state, being larger in synchronized states than in more desynchronized states. Contrary to previous reports, these fluctuations invested the overall population, regardless of preferred orientation. The global fluctuations substantially increased variability in single neurons and correlations among pairs of neurons. Once this effect was removed, pairwise correlations were reduced and were similar regardless of cortical state. These results highlight the importance of cortical state in controlling cortical operation and can help reconcile previous studies, which differed widely in their estimate of neuronal variability and pairwise correlations.},

The variance of response (SD2) to repeated identical stimuli was directly proportional to response magnitude (R), (SD2 = C2R). The values of C were not found to differ significantly between different types of cortical cells. The relationship predicts that the coefficient of variation (SD/R) will be smallest near the peak of the tuning curve, indicating that the peak response is most reliable for detecting an orientation but not necessarily the most sensitive to a change in orientation. Tuning curves and response variability were then examined to determine the orientation at which the neuron was most sensitive to changes in stimulus orientation using signal detection theory. The discrimination index (d’ = [R1-R2]/SD) for a 1 degree change in stimulus orientation was greatest along the flanks of the tuning curve. In order to generalize the experimental data, response distributions derived from a model of cells with parameters based on experimental data were examined to determine the minimal discriminable change in stimulus orientation. Changes of stimulus orientation between 0.6 and 5 deg of arc could be detected from single responses of a single cell by an optimal observer with 75% accuracy if the orientation change was centered at the most sensitive part of the tuning curve.},

abstract = {Humans are adept at distinguishing between stimuli that are very similar, an ability that is particularly crucial when the outcome is of serious consequence (e.g., for a surgeon or air-traffic controller). Traditionally, selective attention was thought to facilitate perception by increasing the gain of sensory neurons tuned to the defining features of a behaviorally relevant object (e.g., color, orientation, etc.). In contrast, recent mathematical models counterintuitively suggest that, in many cases, attentional gain should be applied to neurons that are tuned away from relevant features, especially when discriminating highly similar stimuli. Here we used psychophysical methods to critically evaluate these “ideal observer” models. The data demonstrate that attention enhances the gain of the most informative sensory neurons, even when these neurons are tuned away from the behaviorally relevant target feature. Moreover, the degree to which an individual adopted optimal attentional gain settings by the end of testing predicted success rates on a difficult visual discrimination task, as well as the amount of task improvement that occurred across repeated testing sessions (learning). Contrary to most traditional accounts, these observations suggest that the primary function of attentional gain is not to enhance the representation of target features per se, but instead to optimize performance on the current perceptual task. Additionally, individual differences in gain suggest that the operating characteristics of low-level attentional phenomena are not stable trait-like attributes and that variability in how attention is deployed may play an important role in determining perceptual abilities.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the mouse thalamus has emerged as a powerful experimental system for understanding the refinement of developing sensory connections. Interestingly, many of the basic tenets for such developmental remodeling (for example, pruning of connections to form precise sensory maps) fail to take into account a fundamental aspect of sensory organization, cell-type specific wiring. To date, studies have focused on thalamocortical relay neurons and little is known about the development of retinal connections onto the other principal cell type of dLGN, intrinsic interneurons. Here, we used a transgenic mouse line in which green fluorescent protein (GFP) is expressed within dLGN interneurons (GAD67-GFP), making it possible to visualize them in acutely prepared thalamic slices in order to examine their morphology and functional patterns of connectivity throughout postnatal life. FINDINGS: GFP-expressing interneurons were evenly distributed throughout dLGN and had highly complex and widespread dendritic processes that often crossed eye-specific borders. Estimates of retinal convergence derived from excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) amplitude by stimulus intensity plots revealed that unlike relay cells, interneurons recorded throughout the first 5 weeks of life, maintain a large number (approximately eight to ten) of retinal inputs. CONCLUSIONS: The lack of pruning onto interneurons suggests that the activity-dependent refinement of retinal connections in dLGN is cell-type specific. The high degree of retinal convergence onto interneurons may be necessary for these cells to provide both widespread and local forms of inhibition in dLGN.},

Using an auditory stimulus whose pitch value changed according to specific rules, we controlled and separated the three key computational variables underlying perception, and discovered, using direct recordings from human auditory cortex, that surprise due to prediction violations is encoded by local field potential oscillations in the gamma band (>30 Hz), changes to predictions in the beta band (12-30 Hz), and that the precision of predictions appears to quantitatively relate to alpha band oscillations (8-12 Hz). These results confirm oscillatory codes for critical aspects of generative models of perception.},

Glutamatergic Mthal neurons, transduced with channelrhodopsin-2 by injection of lentiviral vector (Lenti.CaMKII.hChR2(H134R).mCherry), were selectively stimulated with blue light (473 nm) via a chronically implanted fiber-optic probe. Rats performed a reach-to-grasp task in either acute drug-induced parkinsonian akinesia (0.03-0.07 mg/kg haloperidol, s.c.) or control (vehicle injection) conditions, and the number of reaches was recorded for 5 min before, during, and after stimulation. We compared the effect of DBS using complex physiological patterns previously recorded in the Mthal of a control rat during reaching or exploring behavior, with tonic DBS delivering the same number of stimuli per second (rate-control 6.2 or 1.8 Hz, respectively) and with stimulation patterns commonly used in other brain regions to treat neurological conditions (tonic 130 Hz, theta burst (TBS), and tonic 15 Hz rate-control for TBS). Control rats typically executed >150 reaches per 5 min, which was unaffected by any of the stimulation patterns. Acute parkinsonian rats executed <20 reaches, displaying marked akinesia, which was significantly improved by stimulating with the physiological reaching pattern or TBS (both p < 0.05), whereas the exploring and all tonic patterns failed to improve reaching. Data indicate that the Mthal may be an effective site to treat akinesia, but the pattern of stimulation is critical for improving reaching in parkinsonian rats.},

Here we challenge this idea by use of a novel procedure in which human participants, who were deprived of food and water, passively viewed visual stimuli while receiving occasional drops of water as rewards. Visual orientation stimuli, which were temporally paired with the liquid rewards, were viewed monocularly and rendered imperceptible by continuously flashing contour-rich patterns to the other eye. Results show that visual learning can be formed in human adults through stimulus-reward pairing in the absence of a task and without awareness of the stimulus presentation or reward contingencies.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: What roles do the different cortical layers play in visual processing? We recorded simultaneously from all layers of the primary visual cortex while monkeys performed a figure-ground segregation task. This task can be divided into different subprocesses that are thought to engage feedforward, horizontal, and feedback processes at different time points. These different connection types have different patterns of laminar terminations in V1 and can therefore be distinguished with laminar recordings. RESULTS: We found that the visual response started 40 ms after stimulus presentation in layers 4 and 6, which are targets of feedforward connections from the lateral geniculate nucleus and distribute activity to the other layers. Boundary detection started shortly after the visual response. In this phase, boundaries of the figure induced synaptic currents and stronger neuronal responses in upper layer 4 and the superficial layers ~70 ms after stimulus onset, consistent with the hypothesis that they are detected by horizontal connections. In the next phase, ~30 ms later, synaptic inputs arrived in layers 1, 2, and 5 that receive feedback from higher visual areas, which caused the filling in of the representation of the entire figure with enhanced neuronal activity. CONCLUSIONS: The present results reveal unique contributions of the different cortical layers to the formation of a visual percept. This new blueprint of laminar processing may generalize to other tasks and to other areas of the cerebral cortex, where the layers are likely to have roles similar to those in area V1.},

In cats and monkeys, the strength of suppression is sensitive to orientation; responses to regions containing uniform orientations are more suppressed than those containing orientation contrast. This effect is thought to be important for scene segmentation, but the underlying neural mechanisms are poorly understood. We asked whether it is possible to study these mechanisms in the visual cortex of mice, because of recent advances in technology for studying the cortical circuitry in mice. It is unknown whether neurons in mouse V1 are sensitive to orientation contrast. We measured the orientation selectivity of surround suppression in the different layers of mouse V1. We found strong surround suppression in layer 4 and the superficial layers, part of which was orientation tuned: iso-oriented surrounds caused more suppression than cross-oriented surrounds. Surround suppression was delayed relative to the visual response and orientation-tuned suppression was delayed further, suggesting two separate suppressive mechanisms. Previous studies proposed that surround suppression depends on the activity of inhibitory somatostatin-positive interneurons in the superficial layers. To test the involvement of the superficial layers we topically applied lidocaine. Silencing of the superficial layers did not prevent orientation-tuned suppression in layer 4. These results show that neurons in mouse V1, which lacks orientation columns, show orientation-dependent surround suppression in layer 4 and the superficial layers and that surround suppression in layer 4 does not require contributions from neurons in the superficial layers.},

We hypothesized that similar changes in neural firing would take place in early visual areas of the human visual system, leading to changes in the perception of low-level visual features. In this study, we investigated whether contrast perception is affected by figure-ground assignment using stimuli similar to those in the electrophysiological studies in monkeys. We measured contrast discrimination thresholds and perceived contrast for Gabor probes placed on figures or the background and found that the perceived contrast of the probe was increased when it was placed on a figure. Furthermore, we tested how this effect compared with the well-known effect of orientation contrast on perceived contrast. We found that figure-ground assignment and orientation contrast produced changes in perceived contrast of a similar magnitude, and that they interacted. Our results demonstrate that figure-ground assignment influences perceived contrast, consistent with an effect of figure-ground assignment on activity in early visual areas of the human visual system.},

One of the best examples of placebo effectiveness is relief of pain. In general, there is an assumption that placebo changes expectancy, needs, and/or belief about the perception related to the stimulus. These changes can be mediated by several mechanisms, including altered descending modulation via brainstem inhibitory systems and activation of endogenous opioid systems. Both of these mechanisms can lead to changes to the affective/motivational dimension of pain processing. Brain areas implicated in this pain dimension include the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) and the right anterior insula (AI). Interestingly, a role for the rostral ACC (rACC) is frequently described in placebo analgesia. Strategically positioned to form a loop from limbic to brainstem to medial prefrontal regions, the rACC is densely populated with µ-opioid receptors and is activated by opioid as well as placebo analgesia (Petrovic et al., 2002).},

This hierarchical organization presents challenges to perception: objects compete when they are presented in a single RF, and component object features are coded by anatomically distributed neuronal activity. Recent research has shown that selective attention coordinates the activity of neurons to resolve competition and link distributed object representations. We refer to this ensemble activity as a &quot;coherence field&quot;, and propose that voluntary shifts of attention are initiated by a transient control signal that &quot;nudges&quot; the visual system from one coherent state to another.},

This phenomenon thus provides an optimal situation to study the fate of stimuli not consciously perceived and the differences between conscious and nonconscious processing. We correlated behavioral visibility ratings and recordings of event-related potentials to study the temporal dynamics of access to consciousness. Intact early potentials (P1 and N1) were evoked by unseen words, suggesting that these brain events are not the primary correlates of conscious perception. However, we observed a rapid divergence around 270 ms, after which several brain events were evoked solely by seen words. Thus, we suggest that the transition toward access to consciousness relates to the optional triggering of a late wave of activation that spreads through a distributed network of cortical association areas.},

Accumulating evidence has shown that asymmetry of electrical synapses is a fundamental and dynamic property, but the effect of asymmetry on coupled networks is unexplored. Recording from patched pairs in rat brain slices, we investigate asymmetry in the subthreshold regime and show that electrical synapses can exert powerful effects on the spike times of coupled neighbors. Electrical synaptic signaling modulates spike timing by 10-20 ms, in an effect that also exhibits asymmetry. Furthermore, we show through modeling that coupling asymmetry expands the set of outputs for pairs of coupled neurons through enhanced regions of synchrony and reversals of spike order. These results highlight the power and specificity of signaling exerted by electrical synapses, which contribute to information flow across the brain.},

abstract = {By most accounts, the mind arises from the integrated activity of large populations of neurons distributed across multiple brain regions. A contrasting model is presented in the present paper that places the mind/brain interface not at the whole brain level but at the level of single neurons. Specifically, it is proposed that each neuron in the nervous system is independently conscious, with conscious content corresponding to the spatial pattern of a portion of that neuron’s dendritic electrical activity. For most neurons, such as those in the hypothalamus or posterior sensory cortices, the conscious activity would be assumed to be simple and unable to directly affect the organism’s macroscopic conscious behavior. For a subpopulation of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the lateral prefrontal cortices, however, an arrangement is proposed to be present such that, at any given moment: (i) the spatial pattern of electrical activity in a portion of the dendritic tree of each neuron in the subpopulation individually manifests a complexity and diversity sufficient to account for the complexity and diversity of conscious experience; (ii) the dendritic trees of the neurons in the subpopulation all contain similar spatial electrical patterns; (iii) the spatial electrical pattern in the dendritic tree of each neuron interacts non-linearly with the remaining ambient dendritic electrical activity to determine the neuron’s overall axonal response; (iv) the dendritic spatial pattern is reexpressed at the population level by the spatial pattern exhibited by a synchronously firing subgroup of the conscious neurons, thereby providing a mechanism by which conscious activity at the neuronal level can influence overall behavior. The resulting scheme is one in which conscious behavior appears to be the product of a single macroscopic mind, but is actually the integrated output of a chorus of minds, each associated with a different neuron.},

abstract = {Cortical neurons exhibit tremendous variability in the number and temporal distribution of spikes in their discharge patterns. Furthermore, this variability appears to be conserved over large regions of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that it is neither reduced nor expanded from stage to stage within a processing pathway. To investigate the principles underlying such statistical homogeneity, we have analyzed a model of synaptic integration incorporating a highly simplified integrate and fire mechanism with decay. We analyzed a “high-input regime” in which neurons receive hundreds of excitatory synaptic inputs during each interspike interval. To produce a graded response in this regime, the neuron must balance excitation with inhibition. We find that a simple integrate and fire mechanism with balanced excitation and inhibition produces a highly variable interspike interval, consistent with experimental data. Detailed information about the temporal pattern of synaptic inputs cannot be recovered from the pattern of output spikes, and we infer that cortical neurons are unlikely to transmit information in the temporal pattern of spike discharge. Rather, we suggest that quantities are represented as rate codes in ensembles of 50-100 neurons. These column-like ensembles tolerate large fractions of common synaptic input and yet covary only weakly in their spike discharge. We find that an ensemble of 100 neurons provides a reliable estimate of rate in just one interspike interval (10-50 msec). Finally, we derived an expression for the variance of the neural spike count that leads to a stable propagation of signal and noise in networks of neurons-that is, conditions that do not impose an accumulation or diminution of noise. The solution implies that single neurons perform simple algebra resembling averaging, and that more sophisticated computations arise by virtue of the anatomical convergence of novel combinations of inputs to the cortical column from external sources Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

abstract = {In many cortical and subcortical areas, neurons are known to modulate their average firing rate in response to certain external stimulus features. It is widely believed that information about the stimulus features is coded by a weighted average of the neural responses. Recent theoretical studies have shown that the information capacity of such a coding scheme is very limited in the presence of the experimentally observed pairwise correlations. However, central to the analysis of these studies was the assumption of a homogeneous population of neurons. Experimental findings show a considerable measure of heterogeneity in the response properties of different neurons. In this study, we investigate the effect of neuronal heterogeneity on the information capacity of a correlated population of neurons. We show that information capacity of a heterogeneous network is not limited by the correlated noise, but scales linearly with the number of cells in the population. This information cannot be extracted by the population vector readout, whose accuracy is greatly suppressed by the correlated noise. On the other hand, we show that an optimal linear readout that takes into account the neuronal heterogeneity can extract most of this information. We study analytically the nature of the dependence of the optimal linear readout weights on the neuronal diversity. We show that simple online learning can generate readout weights with the appropriate dependence on the neuronal diversity, thereby yielding efficient readout.},

abstract = {1. Variation in stimulus contrast produces a marked effect on the dynamics of the cat retina. This contrast effect was investigated by measurement of the responses of X and Y ganglion cells. The stimuli were sine gratings or rectangular spots modulated by a temporal signal which was a sum of sinusoids. Fourier analysis of the neural response to such a stimulus allowed us to calculate first order and second order frequency kernels. 2. The first order frequency kernel of both X and Y ganglion cells became more sharply tuned at higher contrasts. The peak amplitude also shifted to higher temporal frequency at higher contrasts. Responses to low frequencies of modulation (less than 1 Hz) grew less than proportionally with contrast. However, response amplitudes at higher modulation frequencies (greater than 4 Hz) scaled approximately proportionally with contrast. Also, there was a marked phase advance in these latter components as contrast increased. 3. The contrast effect was significantly larger for Y cells than for X cells. 4. The first order frequency kernel was measured with single sine waves as well as with the sum of sinusoids as a modulation signal. The transfer function measured in this way was much less affected by increases in contrast. This implied that stimulus energy at one temporal frequency could affect the response amplitude and phase shift at another temporal frequency. 5. Direct proof was found that modulation at one frequency modifies the response at other frequencies. This was demonstrated by perturbation experiments in which the modulation stimulus was the sum of one strong perturbing sinusoid and seven weak test sinusoids. 6. The shape of the graph of the amplitude of the first order frequency kernel vs. temporal frequency did not depend on the amplitudes of the first order components, but rather on local retinal contrast. This was shown in an experiment with a sine grating placed at different positions in the visual field. The shape of the first order kernel did not vary with spatial phase, while the magnitudes of the first order responses varied greatly with spatial phase. 7. Models for the contrast gain control mechanism are considered in the Discussion.},

abstract = {1. We studied how responses to visual stimuli at spatially separated locations were combined by cat retinal ganglion cells. 2. The temporal signal which modulated the stimuli was a sum of sinusoids. Fourier analysis of the ganglion cell impulse train yielded first order responses at the modulation frequencies, and second order responses at sums and differences of the input frequencies. 3. Spatial stimuli were spots in the centre and periphery of the cell’s receptive field. Four conditions of stimulation were used: centre alone, periphery alone, centre and periphery in phase, centre and periphery out of phase. 4. The effective first order response of the centre was defined as the response due to centre stimulation in the presence of periphery stimulation, but independent of the relative phases of the two regions. Likewise, the effective first order response of the periphery was defined as the response due to periphery in the presence of centre stimulation, but independent of the relative phases of the two regions. These effective responses may be calculated by addition and subtraction of the measured responses to the combined stimuli. 5. There was a consistent difference between the first order frequency kernal of the effective centre and the first order kernel of the centre alone. The amplitudes of the effective centre responses were diminished at low frequencies of modulation compared to the isolated centre responses. Also, the phase of the effective centre’s response to high frequencies was advanced. Such non-linear interaction occurred in all ganglion cells, X or Y, but the effects were larger in Y cells. 6. In addition to spatially uniform stimuli in the periphery, spatial grating patterns were also used. These peripheral gratings affected the first order kernal of the centre even though the peripheral gratings produced no first order responses by themselves. 7. The temporal properties of the non-linear interaction of centre and periphery were probed by modulation in the periphery with single sinusoids. The most effective temporal frequencies for producing non-linear summation were: (a) 4-15 Hz when all the visual stimuli were spatially uniform, (b) 2-8 Hz when spatial grating patterns were used in the periphery. 8. The characteristics of non-linear spatial summation observed in these experiments are explained by the properties of the contrast gain control mechanism which we have previously postulated.},

This change in shape of the second-order frequency response is a departure from the prediction of the linear/static non-linear/linear sandwich model of the non-linear pathway in the cat retina. The departure is analysed by means of the hypothesis that the two filters of the sandwich model are parametric in contrast. 4. Most of the change in shape of the second-order frequency response with contrast is accounted for in terms of the sandwich model by changes in the transfer characteristics of the filter preceding the static non-linearity. 5. The effect of contrast on the second-order responses of Y cells is qualitatively similar in several ways to the effect of contrast on first-order responses. This suggests that the contrast gain control mechanism acts early in the retina, before linear and non-linear pathways have diverged.},

Enhancement near the preferred orientation is probably caused by feed-forward input from LGN (plus amplification by cortical-cortical interaction). Global suppression could be supplied by cortical inhibition. Additionally, in about 1/3 of V1 neurons (usually the most sharply tuned) there is tuned suppression, centered near the cell’s preferred orientation but broader than tuned enhancement. These mechanisms also can explain important features of steady-state selectivity in the V1 neuron population. Furthermore, similar neuronal mechanisms may be used generally throughout the cerebral cortex},

abstract = {Understanding neural responses with natural stimuli has increasingly become an essential part of characterizing neural coding. Neural responses are commonly characterized by a linear-nonlinear (LN) model, in which the output of a linear filter applied to the stimulus is transformed by a static nonlinearity to determine neural response. To estimate the linear filter in the LN model, studies of responses to natural stimuli commonly use methods that are unbiased only for a linear model (in which there is no static nonlinearity): spike-triggered averages with correction for stimulus power spectrum, with or without regularization. While these methods work well for artificial stimuli, such as Gaussian white noise, we show here that they estimate neural filters of LN models from responses to natural stimuli much more poorly. We studied simple cells in cat primary visual cortex. We demonstrate that the filters computed by directly taking the nonlinearity into account have better predictive power and depend less on the stimulus than those computed under the linear model. With noise stimuli, filters computed using the linear and LN models were similar, as predicted theoretically. With natural stimuli, filters of the two models can differ profoundly. Noise and natural stimulus filters differed significantly in spatial properties, but these differences were exaggerated when filters were computed using the linear rather that the LN model. While regularization of filters computed under the linear model improved their predictive power, it also led to systematic distortions of their spatial frequency profiles, especially at low spatial and temporal frequencies.},

With the goal of establishing an animal model to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying the deployment of visual attention and the guidance of saccades during visual search, we studied the visual behavior of three monkeys while they performed a conjunction (color + form) search task similar to those used in human studies. We found that search performance declined when distractors adjacent to the target shared its color, thereby revealing that color was more discriminable than form in these displays and suggesting that monkeys perceptually grouped stimuli by proximity and similarity. Search performance also varied with the overall composition of the display. Most importantly, saccades were biased toward distractors sharing the target color when there were few of them within the display and away from those distractors when they were numerous. Last, the monkeys initiated saccades with a fixed latency, suggesting that their responses to the display were automatic and that search strategies did not involve attentional resources beyond those recruited for regulating saccades. We conclude that monkeys adapt their visual strategies, largely via bottom-up processes, to both the local and the global context of the search. These findings suggest that the visual behavior of monkeys is guided by strategies similar to those observed in humans.},

We found that a stimulus presented in a neuron’s response field, but not foveated, was associated with greater activity if it was the search target instead of a distractor, indicating that SC neurons could represent stimulus identity. Nevertheless, activity was greater when a saccade was made to a stimulus than when it was not, further implicating these neurons in selecting the saccade goal. Together with the related observation that, when the target fell in their response fields, SC neurons discharged significantly more if the monkey correctly selected it instead of a distractor, these results suggest that visual stimuli are selected when these neurons reach a critical activation level. Our findings show that the outcome of all visual search trials, regardless of the stimulus being selected, is predicted by SC neuronal activity.},

Here we report that many V1 neurons in the awake monkey are sensitive to the stimulus discontinuity between their classical receptive field (CRF) and non-classical receptive field (nCRF) regardless of the visual feature that defines the discontinuity. The magnitude of this sensitivity is strongly dependent on the strength of nCRF suppression of the cell. These properties of V1 neurons may contribute significantly to cue-invariant object perception.},

abstract = {The ability of sensory-motor circuits to integrate sensory evidence over time is thought to underlie the process of decision-making in perceptual discrimination. Recent work has suggested that the NMDA receptor contributes to mediating neural activity integration. To test this hypothesis, we trained three female rhesus monkeys (Macaca mulatta) to perform a visual search task, in which they had to make a saccadic eye movement to the location of a target stimulus presented among distracter stimuli of lower luminance. We manipulated NMDA-receptor function by administering an intramuscular injection of the noncompetitive NMDA antagonist ketamine and assessed visual search performance before and after manipulation. Ketamine was found to lengthen response latency in a dose-dependent fashion. Surprisingly, it was also observed that response accuracy was significantly improved when lower doses were administered. These findings suggest that NMDA receptors play a crucial role in the process of decision-making in perceptual discrimination. They also further support the idea that multiple neural representations compete with one another through mutual inhibition, which may explain the speed-accuracy trade-off rule that shapes discrimination behavior: lengthening integration time helps resolve small differences between choice alternatives, thereby improving accuracy.},

We also present new data in response to questions that arose from recent SC visual search studies. First, we observed that SC discriminating activity predicts saccade initiation when monkeys perform an unconstrained search for a target defined by either a single visual feature or a conjunction of two features. Quantitative differences between the results in these two search tasks suggest, however, that SC discriminating activity does not only reflect saccade programming. This finding concurs with visual search studies conducted in posterior parietal cortex and the idea that, during natural active vision, visual attention is shifted concomitantly with saccade programming. Second, the analysis of a large neuronal sample recorded during feature search revealed that visual neurons in the superficial layers do possess discriminating activity. In addition, the hypotheses that there are distinct types of SC neurons in the deeper layers and that they are differently involved in saccade target selection were not substantiated. Third, we found that the discriminating quality of single-neuron activity substantially surpasses the ability of the monkeys to discriminate the target from distracters, raising the possibility that saccade target selection is a noisy process. We discuss these new findings in light of the visual search literature and the view that the SC is a visual salience map for orienting eye movements.},

These cells switch to tonic mode when depolarized, since the low threshold Ca2+ spike, being voltage dependent, is inactivated at depolarized levels. In this mode they relay information with much more fidelity. This switch can occur under the influence of afferents from the visual cortex or parabrachial region of the brain stem. It has been previously suggested that the tonic mode is characteristic of the waking state while the burst mode signals an interruption of the geniculate relay during sleep. This review surveys the key properties of these two response modes and discusses the implications of new evidence that the burst mode may also occur in the waking animal.},

The latter seem to be electrotonically and thus functionally isolated from the soma and axon, and they enter into complex synaptic arrangements.

abstract = {Studies on the visual thalamic relays, the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar, provide three key properties that have dramatically changed the view that the thalamus serves as a simple relay to get information from subcortical sites to cortex. First, the retinal input, although a small minority (7%) in terms of numbers of synapses onto geniculate relay cells, dominates receptive field properties of these relay cells and strongly drives them; 93% of input thus is nonretinal and modulates the relay in dynamic and important ways related to behavioral state, including attention. We call the retinal input the driver input and the nonretinal, modulator input, and their unique morphological and functional differences allow us to recognize driver and modulator input to many other thalamic relays. Second, much of the modulation is related to control of a voltage-gated, low threshold Ca(2+) conductance that determines response properties of relay cells -burst or tonic - and this, among other things, affects the salience of information relayed. Third, the lateral geniculate nucleus and pulvinar (a massive but generally mysterious and ignored thalamic relay), are examples of two different types of relay: the LGN is a first order relay, transmitting information from a subcortical driver source (retina), while the pulvinar is mostly a higher order relay, transmitting information from a driver source emanating from layer 5 of one cortical area to another area. Higher order relays seem especially important to general corticocortical communication, and this view challenges the conventional dogma that such communication is based on direct corticocortical connections. In this sense, any new information reaching a cortical area, whether from a subcortical source or another cortical area, benefits from a thalamic relay. Other examples of first and higher order relays also exist, and generally higher order relays represent the majority of thalamus. A final property of interest emphasized in chapter 17 by Guillery (2005) is that most or all driver inputs to thalamus, whether from a subcortical source or from layer 5 of cortex, are axons that branch, with the extrathalamic branch innervating a motor or premotor region in the brainstem, or in some cases, spinal cord. This suggests that actual information relayed by thalamus to cortex is actually a copy of motor instructions (Guillery, 2005). Overall, these features of thalamic relays indicate that the thalamus not only provides a behaviorally relevant, dynamic control over the nature of information relayed, it also plays a key role in basic corticocortical communication.},

These mGluRs are found both postsynaptically, on target cells of glutamatergic afferents, and presynaptically, on various synaptic terminals themselves, and when activated, they produce prolonged effects lasting at least hundreds of msec to several sec and perhaps longer. Two main types exist: activation of group I mGluRs causes postsynaptic depolarization, and group II, hyperpolarization. Both types are implicated in synaptic plasticity, both short term and long term. Their evident importance in functioning of thalamus and cortex makes it critical to develop a better understanding of how these receptors are normally activated, especially because they also seem implicated in a wide range of neurological and cognitive pathologies.},

Whereas earlier views tended to relegate thalamic function to a simple, machine-like relay process, recent research, reviewed in this article, demonstrates complicated circuitry and a rich array of membrane properties underlying the thalamic relay. It is now clear that the thalamic relay does not have merely a trivial function. Suggestions that the thalamic circuits and cell properties only come into play during certain phases of sleep to effectively disconnect the relay are correct as far as they go, but they are incomplete, because they fail to take into account interesting and variable properties of the relay that, we argue, occur during normal waking behavior. Although the specific function of the circuits and cellular properties of the thalamic relay for waking behavior is far from clear, we offer two related hypotheses based on recent experimental evidence. One is that the thalamus is not used just to relay peripheral information from, for example, visual, auditory, or cerebellar inputs, but that some thalamic nuclei are arranged instead to relay information from one cortical area to another. The second is that the thalamus is not a simple, passive relay of information to cortex but instead is involved in many dynamic processes that significantly alter the nature of the information relayed to cortex.},

abstract = {The lateral geniculate nucleus is the best understood thalamic relay and serves as a model for all thalamic relays. Only 5–10% of the input to geniculate relay cells derives from the retina, which is the driving input. The rest is modulatory and derives from local inhibitory inputs, descending inputs from layer 6 of the visual cortex, and ascending inputs from the brainstem. These modulatory inputs control many features of retinogeniculate transmission. One such feature is the response mode, burst or tonic, of relay cells, which relates to the attentional demands at the moment. This response mode depends on membrane potential, which is controlled effectively by the modulator inputs. The lateral geniculate nucleus is a first–order relay, because it relays subcortical (i.e. retinal) information to the cortex for the first time. By contrast, the other main thalamic relay of visual information, the pulvinar region, is largely a higher–order relay, since much of it relays information from layer 5 of one cortical area to another. All thalamic relays receive a layer–6 modulatory input from cortex, but higher–order relays in addition receive a layer–5 driver input. Corticocortical processing may involve these corticothalamocortical ‘re–entry’ routes to a far greater extent than previously appreciated. If so, the thalamus sits at an indispensable position for the modulation of messages involved in corticocortical processing.},

The transthalamic pathways provide a thalamic gate that can be open or closed (and otherwise more subtly modulated), and these inputs to the thalamus are generally branches of axons with motor functions. Thus the transthalamic corticocortical pathways that can be gated carry information about the cortical processing in one cortical area and also about the motor instructions currently being issued from that area and copied to other cortical areas.},

Using a memory-based task designed to separate these components, we show that the SEF contains signals coding retinal image-slip-velocity, memory, and assessment of visual motion direction, the decision of whether to pursue, and the preparation for pursuit eye movements. Bilateral muscimol injection into SEF resulted in directional errors in smooth pursuit, errors of whether to pursue, and impairment of initial correct eye movements.

The TMS-triggered scotoma together with “backward filling-in” of it offer a unique neuroscientific case. Findings suggest that various visual attributes are reorganized in a postdictive fashion to be consistent with each other, or to be consistent in a causality framework. In terms of the underlying mechanisms, four prototypical models have been considered: the “catch up,” the “reentry,” the “different pathway” and the “memory revision” models. By extending the list of postdictive phenomena to memory, sensory-motor and higher-level cognition, one may note that such a postdictive reconstruction may be a general principle of neural computation, ranging from milliseconds to months in a time scale, from local neuronal interactions to long-range connectivity, in the complex brain. The operational definition of the “postdictive phenomenon” can be applicable to such a wide range of sensory/cognitive effects across a wide range of time scale, even though the underlying neural mechanisms may vary across them.

abstract = {The pulvinar is an ‘associative’ thalamic nucleus, meaning that most of its input and output relationships are formed with the cerebral cortex. The function of this circuitry is little understood and its anatomy, though much investigated, is notably recondite. This is because pulvinar connection patterns disrespect the architectural subunits (anterior, medial, lateral and inferior pulvinar nuclei) that have been the traditional reference system. This article presents a simplified, global model of the organization of cortico-pulvinar connections so as to pursue their structure-function relationships. Connections between the cortex and pulvinar are topographically organized, and as a result the pulvinar contains a ‘map’ of the cortical sheet. However, the topography is very blurred. Hence the pulvinar connection zones of nearby cortical areas overlap, allowing indirect transcortical communication via the pulvinar. A general observation is that indirect cortico-pulvino-cortical circuits tend to mimic direct cortico-cortical pathways: this is termed ‘the replication principle’. It is equally apt for certain pairs (or groups) of nearby cortical areas that happen not to connect with each other. The ‘replication’ of this non-connection is achieved by discontinuities and dislocations of the cortical topography within the pulvinar, such that the associated pair of connection zones do not overlap. Certain of these deformations can be used to divide the global cortical topography into specific sub-domains, which form the natural units of a connectional subdivision of the pulvinar. A substantial part of the pulvinar also expresses visual topography, reflecting visual maps in occipital cortex. There are just two well-ordered visual maps in the pulvinar, that both receive projections from area V1, and several other occipital areas; the resulting duplication of cortical topography means that each visual map also acts as a separate connection domain. In summary, the model identifies four topographically ordered connection domains, and reconciles the coexistence of visual and cortical maps in two of them. The replication principle operates at and below the level of domain structure. It is argued that cortico-pulvinar circuitry replicates the pattern of cortical circuitry but not its function, playing a more regulatory role instead. Thalamic neurons differ from cortical neurons in their inherent rhythmicity, and the pattern of cortico-thalamic connections must govern the formation of specific resonant circuits. The broad implication is that the pulvinar acts to coordinate cortical information processing by facilitating and sustaining the formation of synchronized trans-areal assemblies; a more pointed suggestion is that, owing to the considerable blurring of cortical topography in the pulvinar, rival cortical assemblies may be in competition to recruit thalamic elements in order to outlast each other in activity.},

abstract = {We have previously shown by focal GABA inactivation of MT direction columns that feedback from MT modulates the responses of primate LGN cells. These effects were most often seen (although not exclusively) for LGN cells that had receptive fields that did not overlap the extent of the inactivated MT receptive field. The assumption was that these effects are mediated by an influence of the responses of layer 6 cortico-thalamic feedback cells in V1. The implication is that the feedback from a specific location in MT influences an area of layer 6 of V1 that is spatially displaced to (although partially overlapping) the MT receptive field. Another interpretation could be that the feedback influence from macaque V1 to the LGN is biased to locations that are displaced to the layer 6 cell fields. As part of this feedback is mediated via the TRN this could be the case because the connections through this route have not been systematically mapped.
We have explored the effect of focal GABA inactivation of layer 6 of V1 on LGN cell responses at locations overlapping and displaced to the receptive fields of the recorded LGN cells. The effects were clear, all LGN cells with overlapping receptive fields (n=20) showed a change in response magnitude during GABA inactivation of layer 6 of V1. These effects were all reversible and repeatable. For the non-overlapping receptive fields 13/19 cells examined showed changes in response magnitude. The mean separation of the non-overlapping receptive fields was 2.6° (± 0.12 SE) and there was no statistical difference between the separation of those fields showing an effect (n=13, mean separation 2.7° ± 0.12 SE) and those that did not (n=6, mean separation 2.3° ± 0.23 SE). These data show that layer 6 of V1 influences a spatially overlapping area of the LGN, and suggest that the influence extends laterally up to the maximal separation tested at 3.5° away. It underlines the surmise that the influence from MT is likely to be relayed via layer 6 of V1 and indicates that the spatial displacement of the influence from MT to LGN derives from an asymmetry in the organization of the influence of the feedback connections from MT.},

abstract = {The visual features of an object are processed by multiple, functionally specialized areas of cerebral cortex. When several objects are seen simultaneously, what mechanism preserves the association of features that belong to a single item? We address this question-known as the “binding problem”-by examining combinatorial feature selectivity of neurons in area V2. In recording from anesthetized macaques, we estimate that dual selectivity for chromatic and spatiotemporal attributes is 50% more common (27% vs. 18% sampling frequency) in superficial and deep layer neurons receiving feedback connections from higher areas, compared with layer 4-3 neurons relaying ascending signals. The operation of feedback pathways is thought to mediate attentional modulation of activity that may achieve binding through acting to select one single object for higher representation and filtering out competing objects. We propose that dual-selective neurons perform a “bridging” function, mediating the transfer of feedback-induced bias between feature dimensions. The bias can be propagated through V2 output neurons (of unitary selectivity) to higher levels of specialized processing and so promote selection of the target object’s representation among multiple feature maps. The bridging function would thus act to unify the outcome of parallel, object-selective processes taking place along segregated visual pathways.},

Through simultaneous functional magnetic resonance imaging and electrophysiological recording, we demonstrate a negative BOLD response (NBR) beyond the stimulated regions of visual cortex, associated with local decreases in neuronal activity below spontaneous activity, detected 7.15 3.14 mm away from the closest positively responding region in V1. Trial-by-trial amplitude fluctuations revealed tight coupling between the NBR and neuronal activity decreases. The NBR was associated with comparable decreases in local field potentials and multiunit activity. Our findings indicate that a significant component of the NBR originates in neuronal activity decreases.},

Two major groups of retinal ganglion cells, the X and Y cells, have been reported not to be sensitive to the direction of stimulus motion. 2. We recorded action potentials of retinal ganglion cells intraocularly. We studied quantitatively the visual responses elicited by drifting sinusoidal gratings of various spatial frequencies, bars, and spots. 3. The results confirm previous reports that most cat retinal ganglion cells exhibit orientation biases when tested with gratings of relatively high spatial frequency. 4. Additionally, we find that 22% of X and 34% of Y type retinal ganglion cells exhibit direction biases. Overall, Y cells displayed significantly stronger direction biases than did X cells. 5. In general, direction biases are clearest when the test gratings are of relatively low spatial frequency. 6. The direction biases of X and Y cells subserving the central 15 degrees of retina were weaker than those of cells subserving more peripheral regions. 7. The direction-biased responses of cat ganglion cells were similar to those of X and Y type relay cells in the cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGNd). Thus we suggest that the direction biases of LGNd cells are a reflection of their retinal inputs.},

abstract = {The ability to probe defined neural circuits with both the spatial and temporal resolution imparted by optogenetics has transformed the field of neuroscience. Although much attention has been paid to the advantages of manipulating neural activity at millisecond timescales in order to elicit time-locked neural responses, little consideration has been given to the manipulation of circuit activity at physiologically relevant times of day, across multiple days. Nearly all biological events are governed by the circadian clock and exhibit 24 h rhythms in activity. Indeed, neural circuit activity itself exhibits a daily rhythm with distinct temporal peaks in activity occurring at specific times of the day. Therefore, experimentally probing circuit function within and across physiologically relevant time windows (minutes to hours) in behaving animals is fundamental to understanding the function of any one particular circuit within the intact brain. Furthermore, understanding how circuit function changes with repeated manipulation is important for modeling the circuit-wide disruptions that occur with chronic disease states. Here, we review recent advances in optogenetic technology that allow for chronic, temporally specific, control of circuit activity and provide examples of chronic optogenetic paradigms that have been utilized in the search for the neural circuit basis of behaviors relevant to human neuropsychiatric disease.},

abstract = {Visually elicited inhibitory processes, underlying the receptive field structure of cells in layers A and A1 of the cat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN), have been examined by a combination of visual neurophysiological and iontophoretic techniques. Discrete visual stimulation of both centre and surround mechanisms, produced a powerful suppression of the elevated background discharge levels induced by iontophoretic application of an excitatory amino acid. These observations are consistent with the activation of a postsynaptic inhibitory input, a view supported by the fact that the suppressive effects were blocked by iontophoretic application of bicuculline, an antagonist of GABA, a putative inhibitory transmitter in the dLGN. These inhibitory effects were always elicited by the opposite phase of a flashed stimulus to that eliciting responses associated with the receptive field region. That is ‘on’ inhibitory effects were elicited from ‘off’ excitatory regions and ‘off’ inhibitory effects from ‘on’ excitatory regions. Plotting the responses of dLGN cells to flashed stimuli of increasing diameter, before and during iontophoretic application of bicuculline, revealed a marked reduction of the surround antagonism of centre response in the presence of the drug. During bicuculline application, surround antagonism of centre responses was at a level associated with that seen in retinal ganglion cells. Annular stimuli of internal and external diameter selected to be just outside the centre-surround border, insofar as they gave pure surround responses, were observed in the presence of bicuculline to elicit strong centre responses, as well as surround responses. These observations indicate that GABAergic inhibitory processes generate the enhanced centre-surround antagonism associated with dLGN cells and serve to increase the contrast between the two sets of mechanisms at the centre-surround border. The present conclusions apply equally to ‘X’ and ‘Y’ cells.},

year = {1988}, 
abstract = {The translation of the retinal input through the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) to the visual cortex is highly dependent on a range of influences. This article reviews the available evidence. One of the influences, the corticofugal projection to the dLGN from layer VI of the visual cortex, provides a synaptic input which in magnitude exceeds that from the retina. This makes direct synaptic contact on relay cells and the intrinsic and perigeniculate inhibitory interneurones influencing their activity. The corticofugal system appears to be spatially organised in such a way that for any given region in the dLGN, there is a central zone comprising an overlying field with facilitatory effect, and a surrounding zone with inhibitory influence. The extent to which these overlap is open to question at present. The inhibitory effect of the corticofugal projection can be clearly seen in its contribution to the length tuning of dLGN cells when tested with drifting bars. On average dLGN cells exhibit a very high degree of length tuning, matching that of cortical hypercomplex cells. Removal of the corticofugal influence causes a radical reduction in this, shifting the mean reduction in peak response with increasing bar length from 71% to 43%. One consequence of this corticofugal effect is that the selectivity of the dLGN cell receptive field towards stimuli spatially restricted to the vicinity of the centre mechanism, is as good for moving bars as it is for stationary flashing spots. The retinal output to dLGN relay cells appears to be mediated by excitatory amino acid receptors, of both NMDA and non-NMDA categories. The non-NMDA receptors appear to provide an initial level of depolarisation which enables the operation of the voltage dependent NMDA receptor channels. The NMDA receptor however sits as a critical gate regulating the transmission of retinal information in the dLGN, when it is blocked visual responses are virtually eliminated. Its voltage dependency makes it crucially dependent on the complex pattern of excitatory and inhibitory influences from the cortex and the “non-specific” modulatory influence of the cholinergic system.},

abstract = {The functional influence of the cholinergic input to cat dLGN has been examined by assessing the action of iontophoretically applied acetylcholine (ACh) on the visual responses of cells in layers A and A1. Iontophoretically applied pulses of ACh exerted a strong excitatory action on all 113 cells studied within these layers. In the presence of a sustained application of ACh, the excitatory responses to an optimal stimulus such as a spot of light located within the receptive field centre were greatly facilitated, but at the same time stimulus-specific inhibitory influences were also enhanced. The action of ACh on the stimulus-specific inhibitory influences had the consequence that the responses to non-optimal stimuli were not facilitated to the same extent as those to optimal stimuli and in some cases even diminished. The stimulus-specific inhibitory effects seen in the presence of ACh were very powerful and frequently resulted in complete suppression of the elevated background discharge. We suggest that the ACh directly excites both the relay cells and the Golgi type II inhibitory interneurones within the dLGN. The facilitation of the stimulus-specific inhibition may follow from a direct action on the presynaptic dendrites of the Golgi type II cells which arborize within the dendritic field of the relay cell. Supplementary observations on cells in the perigeniculate nucleus confirm previous findings showing that ACh has an inhibitory effect on these cells. We suggest a tripartite action for the cholinergic influence on the dLGN, involving direct facilitation of relay cells, enhancement of stimulus-specific inhibition via the Golgi type II cells, and disinhibition of the non-specific inhibitory influence form the perigeniculate nucleus.},

abstract = {Purpose: : Cell replacement therapy for age related macular degeneration (AMD) would likely require the restoration of a substrate to replace damaged Bruch’s membrane (BM). We examined the feasibility of autologous peripheral-to-central BM transfer via 180° RPE-BM-choroid rotation. This approach may potentially obviate the need for an artificial substrate to support newly introduced retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells.

Methods: : Surgery was performed in rhesus macaques (N=6). A 41-gauge subretinal infusion of Ca2+ and Mg2+-free BSS Plus (Alcon) was used to induce temporal retinal detachment. Following 180° temporal retinotomy the macula was reflected nasally to reveal the RPE. Under perfluorocarbon liquid an eccentric circular or elliptical disc of RPE-BM-choroid, centred on the recurrent branch of the long posterior ciliary artery (LSPCA), was isolated from surrounding tissue. The disc was rotated 180° about this pedicle, so bringing equatorial BM to the foveal region and vice-versa. The temporal edge of the graft was apposed to the native temporal RPE-BM-choroid. The retina was reattached and stabilized with silicone oil. Serial angiography and optical coherence tomography was performed over 6 months. Neural retinal and RPE morphology at the fovea was assessed by immunohistochemistry and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining for BM.

Results: : In all 6 eyes, the choroidal flap was successfully created and rotated on the recurrent LSPCA pedicle. The retina remained attached in all cases over the period of follow-up and there was evidence of epiretinal membrane formation. RPE cells and cones were lost from the macula three months after surgery. However PAS-positive BM was intact. Graft revascularisation was seen in one case.

Conclusions: : Pedicled RPE-BM-choroid rotation is technically feasible and the procedure enables the transfer of autologous BM from the equator to the macula. Cell viability was compromised as choroidal reperfusion remains a challenge. Autologous BM rotation may be useful to provide a substrate to support macular RPE replaced by future cell therapy approaches.},

The antagonist effects were assessed at ejection current levels producing a selective blockade of the responses to iontophoretically applied NMDA with respect to those elicited by the non-NMDA receptor agonists quisqualate and kainate. These selective effects were determined in an experimental paradigm where the visual response and responses to NMDA and the non-NMDA receptor agonists were compared in the same test run. The data refer to a total population of 52 cells (28 X, 24 Y). 3. Application of APV abolished or greatly reduced the visual responses of both X and Y cells. The mean percentage reduction in the visual response for the X cells studied was 59 +/- 10% (SE; n = 7) and for the Y cells 66 +/- 8% (SE; n = 11). Both the early onset transient and the sustained component of the visual response to the flashed stimulus were equally affected. 4.

abstract = {In a previous study, we have shown that the corticofugal projection to the dLGN enhances inhibitory mechanisms underlying length tuning. This suggests that the inhibitory influences deriving from the corticofugal feedback should exhibit characteristics that reflect the response properties of orientation-tuned layer VI cells. Here we report data obtained from experiments using a bipartite visual stimulus, with an inner section over the dLGN cell receptive field centre and an outer section extending beyond it. For both X and Y cells there was a modulation of the strength of the surround antagonism of centre responses that was dependent on the orientation alignment of contours in the two components of the stimulus. Layer VI cells showed maximal responses when the two components were aligned to the same orientation; dLGN cells showed a minimal response. Varying the orientation alignment of the inner and outer components of the stimulus in a randomised, interleaved fashion showed that bringing the stimulus into alignment resulted in a 24.28% increase in the surround antagonism of the centre response. Blocking cortical activity showed this effect of alignment to be strongly dependent on corticofugal feedback. This effect of orientation alignment appears to apply for any absolute orientation of the alignment condition and supports the view that an entire subset of cortical orientation columns generate the feedback influencing any given dLGN cell. This mechanism makes dLGN cells sensitive to the orientation domain discontinuities in elongated contours moving across their receptive field.},

The objective was to examine the possibility of both N-methyl-D-aspartate and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors being involved in the transfer of the retinal input to X and Y cells in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus. The results show that selective blockade of either N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors or non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors can block the visual response of both X and Y cells. Overall, the most potent reductions of visual responses across the population of cells studied were obtained with the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor antagonist with X cells showing a slightly greater reduction on average (80%) than Y cells (66%). The relatively smaller overall reductions in visual responses obtained with the non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor blockade reflected the lower levels of blockade that were compatible with selectivity using iontophoretic applications of 6-cyano-7-nitroquinoxaline-2,3-dione. It is concluded that N-methyl-D-aspartate and non-N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors are critically involved in the visual response of both “on” and “off” centre X and Y cells.},

By inducing activity in the PPC (angular gyrus) using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), and using the phosphene threshold as a measure of visual cortical excitability, we investigated the functional role of this region in modulating the activity of the visual cortex. When triple-pulses of TMS were applied over the PPC unilaterally, the intensity of stimulation required to elicit a phosphene from the visual cortex (area V1/V2) was reduced, indicating an increase in visual cortical excitability. The increased excitability that was observed with unilateral TMS was abolished when TMS was applied over the PPC bilaterally. Our results provide a demonstration of the top-down modulation exerted by the PPC on the visual cortex and show that these effects are subject to interhemispheric competition.},

Here, we show that activity in early visual cortex is sustained during maintenance of attention in the absence of visual stimulation. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to measure activity in visual cortex while human subjects performed a visual detection task in which a variable-duration delay period preceded target presentation. Portions of cortical areas V1, V2, and V3 representing the attended part of the visual field exhibited sustained increases in activity throughout the delay period. Portions of these cortical areas representing peripheral, unattended parts of the visual field displayed sustained decreases in activity. The data were well-fit by a model that assumed the sustained neural activity was constant in amplitude over a time period equal to that of the actual delay period for each trial. These results demonstrate that sustained attention responses are present in early visual cortex (including primary visual cortex) in the absence of a visual stimulus, and that these responses correlate with the allocation of visuospatial attention in both the spatial and temporal domains.},

Patches supply thin stripes, whereas interpatches supply pale stripes and thick stripes. Previously, the projection from patches to thin stripes was reported to arise exclusively from layer 2/3. In this present report, we made injections of a retrograde tracer, cholera toxin-B (CTB-Au), into macaque V2 thin stripes to re-examine the laminar origin of their input from V1. While the great majority of cells indeed resided in layer 2/3, small populations were also present in layers 4A, 4B, and 5/6. The location of CTB-filled cells in each layer was analyzed to determine the relationship with CO patches. Cells in layers 2/3, 4A, and 4B were aggregated into patches, forming columns that project to thin stripes. Surprisingly, cells in layer 5/6 were scattered, seemingly at random. These findings confirm that the main V1 projection to V2 stripes emanates from patches in layer 2/3. However, multiple V1 layers innervate V2 thin stripes, and the projection from layer 5/6 does not respect the patch/interpatch dichotomy.},

After extracting the EPSPs, which are often partially merged with spike waveforms, we found that >95% of spikes were associated with an EPSP from a single retinal ganglion cell. Each spike within a “burst” train was generated by an EPSP, indicating that LGN bursts are inherited from retinal bursts. LGN neurons rarely fired unless at least two EPSPs summated within 40 ms. This facilitation in EPSP efficacy was followed by depression. If a spike was generated by the first EPSP in a pair, it did not alter the efficacy of the second EPSP. Hence, the timing of EPSPs arising from the primary retinal driver governs synaptic efficacy and provides the basis for successful retinogeniculate transmission.},

abstract = {Along most neural pathways, the spike trains transmitted from one neuron to the next are altered. In the process, neurons can either achieve a more efficient stimulus representation, or extract some biologically important stimulus parameter, or succeed at both. We recorded the inputs from single retinal ganglion cells and the outputs from connected lateral geniculate neurons in the macaque to examine how visual signals are relayed from retina to cortex. We found that geniculate neurons re-encoded multiple temporal stimulus features to yield output spikes that carried more information about stimuli than was available in each input spike. The coding transformation of some relay neurons occurred with no decrement in information rate, despite output spike rates that averaged half the input spike rates. This preservation of transmitted information was achieved by the short-term summation of inputs that geniculate neurons require to spike. A reduced model of the retinal and geniculate visual responses, based on two stimulus features and their associated nonlinearities, could account for >85% of the total information available in the spike trains and the preserved information transmission. These results apply to neurons operating on a single time-varying input, suggesting that synaptic temporal integration can alter the temporal receptive field properties to create a more efficient representation of visual signals in the thalamus than the retina.},

abstract = {The purposes of this study were 1) to relate the receptive-field characteristics of area 17 cells to their afferent and efferent connections, and 2) to obtain quantitative data from area 17 neurons for later comparison with area 18 cells. Intra- and extracellular recordings were obtained in paralyzed preparations which were anesthetized with nitrous oxide. The connectivities of the recorded cells were determined from responses to electrical stimulation of afferent and efferent pathways. In parallel to the classification of units as simple and complex cells, the receptive fields were grouped in four classes according to the spatial arrangement of on- and off-areas; class I, fields with exclusive on- or off-areas; class II, fields with spatially separate on- and off-areas; class III, fields with mixed on-off areas; class IV, fields which could not be mapped with stationary stimuli. The results from electrical stimulation suggest two major classes of cells: cells in the first group are driven mainly or exclusively by LGN afferents. They rarely receive additional excitation from intrinsic or callosal afferents and rarely possess corticofugal axons. Cells in the second group receive either converging inputs from LGN afferents and further intrinsic afferents or only from intrinsic afferents. They frequently received additional input from callosum and from recurrent collaterals of corticofugal axons. They project subcortically more often than cells in the first group. Cells in both groups can be driven either by X- or Y-type afferents. Cells in the first group have mainly class I and class II fields or simple fields, whereas the neurons in the second group have mainly class III and class IV fields or complex fields. Thus, simple and complex cells differ in their connectivity patterns, but the discriminative parameter is neither the selective connection to the X- or the Y-system nor, in a strict sense, the synaptic distance from subcortical input. From the combined consideration of receptive-field properties and connectivity patterns it is concluded that class I and class II cells or simple cells are concerned mainly with the primary analysis of subcortical activity, whereas class III and class IV cells or complex cells perform a correlative analysis between highly convergent activity from extrinsic and intrinsic afferents.},

abstract = {Purpose: : Cell replacement therapy for age related macular degeneration (AMD) would likely require the restoration of a substrate to replace damaged Bruch’s membrane (BM). We examined the feasibility of autologous peripheral-to-central BM transfer via 180° RPE-BM-choroid rotation. This approach may potentially obviate the need for an artificial substrate to support newly introduced retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cells.

Methods: : Surgery was performed in rhesus macaques (N=6). A 41-gauge subretinal infusion of Ca2+ and Mg2+-free BSS Plus (Alcon) was used to induce temporal retinal detachment. Following 180° temporal retinotomy the macula was reflected nasally to reveal the RPE. Under perfluorocarbon liquid an eccentric circular or elliptical disc of RPE-BM-choroid, centred on the recurrent branch of the long posterior ciliary artery (LSPCA), was isolated from surrounding tissue. The disc was rotated 180° about this pedicle, so bringing equatorial BM to the foveal region and vice-versa. The temporal edge of the graft was apposed to the native temporal RPE-BM-choroid. The retina was reattached and stabilized with silicone oil. Serial angiography and optical coherence tomography was performed over 6 months. Neural retinal and RPE morphology at the fovea was assessed by immunohistochemistry and periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) staining for BM.

Results: : In all 6 eyes, the choroidal flap was successfully created and rotated on the recurrent LSPCA pedicle. The retina remained attached in all cases over the period of follow-up and there was evidence of epiretinal membrane formation. RPE cells and cones were lost from the macula three months after surgery. However PAS-positive BM was intact. Graft revascularisation was seen in one case.

Conclusions: : Pedicled RPE-BM-choroid rotation is technically feasible and the procedure enables the transfer of autologous BM from the equator to the macula. Cell viability was compromised as choroidal reperfusion remains a challenge. Autologous BM rotation may be useful to provide a substrate to support macular RPE replaced by future cell therapy approaches.},

abstract = {In the visual cortex some neurons respond more strongly to short stimuli than to long ones. This is referred to as “end-stopping” and has been generally attributed to inhibition. The role of inhibition, however, has been difficult to demonstrate. Moreover, modeling has shown that end-stopping can be created solely from excitation. The roles of excitation and inhibition were investigated using intracellular recordings (Anderson et al., 2001, J. Neurosci. 21: 2104-2112). The results of that study were interpreted in favor of inhibition. The present report re-examines these results and finds that they may be in good, perhaps even better, agreement with an excitation model of end-stopping.},

We sought to discover whether visual mental imagery could evoke cortical activity with precise visual field topography (retinotopy). Participants received three conditions: the perception condition consisted of a standard retinotopic mapping procedure, where two flickering checkerboard wedges rotated around a central fixation point. The imagery and attention conditions consisted of the same stimulus, but only the outer arcs of the wedges were visible. During imagery, participants mentally reproduced the stimulus wedges, using the stimulus arcs as a guide. The attention condition required either distributed attention or focused attention to where the stimulus wedges would have been. Event-related analysis revealed that the imagery (greater than either form of attention) retinotopic maps were similar to the perception maps. Moreover, blocked analysis revealed similar perception and imagery effects in human motion processing region MT+. These results support the depictive view of visual mental imagery.},

abstract = {A novel method of chronic optical imaging based on new voltage-sensitive dyes (VSDs) was developed to facilitate the explorations of the spatial and temporal patterns underlying higher cognitive functions in the neocortex of behaving monkeys. Using this system, we were able to explore cortical dynamics, with high spatial and temporal resolution, over period of less than or equal to1 yr from the same patch of cortex. The visual cortices of trained macaques were stained one to three times a week, and immediately after each staining session, the monkey started to perform the behavioral task, while the primary and secondary visual areas (V1 and V2) were imaged with a fast optical imaging system. Long-term repeated VSD imaging (VSDI) from the same cortical area did not disrupt the normal cortical architecture as confirmed repeatedly by optical imaging based on intrinsic signals. The spatial patterns of functional maps obtained by VSDI were essentially identical to those obtained from the same patch of cortex by imaging based on intrinsic signals. On comparing the relative amplitudes of the evoked signals and differential map obtained using these two different imaging methodologies, we found that VSDI emphasizes subthreshold activity more than imaging based on intrinsic signals, that emphasized more spiking activity. The latency of the VSD-evoked response in V1 ranged from 46 to 68 ms in the different monkeys. The amplitude of the V2 response was only 20-60% of that in V1 As expected from the anatomy, the retinotopic responses to local visual stimuli spread laterally across the cortical surface at a spreading velocity of 0.15-0.19 m/s over a larger area than that expected by the classical magnification factor, reaching its maximal anisotropic spatial extent within similar to40 ms. We correlated the observed dynamics of cortical activation patterns with the monkey’s saccadic eye movements and found that due to the slow offset of the cortical response relative to its onset, there was a short period of simultaneous activation of two distinct patches of cortex following a saccade to the visual stimulus. We also found that a saccade to a small stimulus was followed by direct transient activation of a cortical region in areas of V1 and V2, located retinotopically within the saccadic trajectory},

There exists now a wide range of experimentally validated protein tools capable of modifying cellular function, including light-gated ion channels, recombinant light-gated G protein-coupled receptors, and even neurotransmitter receptors modified with tethered photo-switchable ligands. A large number of genetically encoded protein sensors have also been developed to optically track cellular activity in real time, including membrane-voltage-sensitive fluorophores and fluorescent calcium and pH indicators. The development of techniques for controlled expression of these proteins has also increased their utility by allowing the study of specific populations of cells. Additionally, recent advances in optics technology have enabled both activation and observation of target proteins with high spatiotemporal fidelity. In combination, these methods have great potential in the study of neural circuits and networks, behavior, animal models of disease, as well as in high-throughput ex vivo studies. This review collects some of these new tools and methods and surveys several current and future applications of the evolving field of optophysiology.},

abstract = {The spiking activity of cortical neurons is correlated. For instance, trial-to-trial fluctuations in response strength are shared between neurons, and spikes often occur synchronously. Understanding the properties and mechanisms that generate these forms of correlation is critical for determining their role in cortical processing. We therefore investigated the spatial extent and functional specificity of correlated spontaneous and evoked activity. Because feedforward, recurrent, and feedback pathways have distinct extents and specificity, we reasoned that these measurements could elucidate the contribution of each type of input. We recorded single unit activity with microelectrode arrays which allowed us to measure correlation in many hundreds of pairings, across a large range of spatial scales. Our data show that correlated evoked activity is generated by two mechanisms that link neurons with similar orientation preferences on different spatial scales: one with high temporal precision and a limited spatial extent (approximately 3 mm), and a second that gives rise to correlation on a slow time scale and extends as far as we were able to measure (10 mm). The former is consistent with common input provided by horizontal connections; the latter likely involves feedback from extrastriate cortex. Spontaneous activity was correlated over a similar spatial extent, but approximately twice as strongly as evoked activity. Visual stimuli thus caused a substantial decrease in correlation, particularly at response onset. These properties and the circuit mechanism they imply provide new constraints on the functional role that correlation may play in visual processing.},

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and pattern-classification methods to show that the cortical representation of a nonstimulated quarter-field carries information that can discriminate the surrounding visual context. We show further that the activity patterns in these regions are significantly related to those observed with feed-forward stimulation and that these effects are driven primarily by V1. These results thus demonstrate that visual context strongly influences early visual areas even in the absence of differential feed-forward thalamic stimulation.},

abstract = {Contextual modulation due to feature contrast between the receptive field and surrounding region has been reported for numerous stimuli in primary visual cortex. One type of this modulation, iso-orientation surround suppression, has been studied extensively. The degree to which surround suppression is related to other forms of contextual modulation remains unknown. We used shape-from-shading stimuli in a field of distractors to test the latency and magnitude of contextual modulation to a stimulus that cannot be distinguished with an orientation-selective mechanism. This stimulus configuration readily elicits perceptual pop-out in human observers and induces a long-latency contextual modulation response in neurons in macaque early visual cortex. We found that animals trained to detect the location of a pop-out stimulus were better at finding a sphere that appeared to be lit from below in the presence of distractors that were lit from above. Furthermore, neuronal responses were stronger and had shorter latency in the condition where behavioral performance was best. This asymmetry is compatible with earlier psychophysical findings in human observers. In the population of V1 neurons, the latency of the contextual modulation response is 145 ms on average (ranging from 70 to 230 ms). This is much longer than the latency for iso-orientation surround suppression, indicating that the underlying circuitry is distinct. Our results support the idea that a feature-specific feedback signal generates the pop-out responses we observe and suggest that V1 neurons actively participate in the computation of perceptual salience.},

In a functional MRI study, we examined the relative contributions to activity in the human posterior pulvinar made by visual drive (the presence of an unattended visual stimulus) and attention (covert spatial attention to the stimulus). In an event-related design, large optic flow stimuli were presented to the left and/or right of a central fixation point. When unattended, the stimuli robustly activated two regions of the pulvinar, one medial and one dorsal with respect to the lateral geniculate. The activity in both regions shows a strong contralateral bias, suggesting retinotopic organization. Primate physiology suggests that the two regions could be two portions of the same double map of the visual field. In our paradigm, attending to the stimulus enhanced the response by about 20%. Thus attention is not necessary to activate the human pulvinar and the degree of attentional enhancement matches, but does not exceed, that seen in the cortical regions with which the posterior pulvinar connects.},

The strong percept of global form that arises from the sparse local orientation cues has made these patterns the subject of psychophysical investigations, yet neuronal responses to Glass patterns have not been studied. We measured the responses of neurons in macaque striate cortex (V1) to dynamic, translational Glass patterns as a function of dot separation and dot-pair orientation. Responses were selective, but were on average more than an order of magnitude weaker than responses to sinusoidal gratings. Response and selectivity were greatest when the dot-pair orientation matched that of the preferred grating and when dot separation was between one-quarter and one-half of the spatial period of the optimal grating; changing the dot-pair separation or inverting the contrast of one of the dots radically changed the orientation selectivity. We computed the expected responses for a receptive field model to translational Glass patterns and found that the complexity of our V1 tuning curves could be understood in terms of the responses of linear filters to pairs of dots. This modeling connects our understanding of V1 receptive fields as rectified, quasi-linear filters with results from psychophysical studies of Glass patterns. Our results provide a basis for studying how subsequent visual areas integrate weak, local signals into global form percepts},

We compared the time course of responses in CDS and PDS neurons in opiate-anesthetized macaques, using a rapid pseudorandom sequence of gratings and plaids that moved in different directions. On average, responses began 6 ms earlier in CDS neurons than in PDS neurons. More importantly, the pattern-selective responses of PDS neurons did not reach their fully selective state until 50−75 ms after the responses of CDS neurons had stabilized. The population motion response of MT is therefore initially dominated by component motion signals, and does not completely represent pattern motion until substantially later. The circuits that compute pattern motion take more time to finish their work than those signaling component motion.},

The presence of a parallel stimulus outside the CRF can have a similar effect, in this case known as surround suppression. We used a novel stimulus to probe the time course of cross-orientation suppression and found that it is very fast, starting even before the response to optimal excitatory stimuli. However, it occurs with soelay after the offset response, considered to be a measure of the earliest excitatory signals that reach the CRF. We also examined the time course of response to a stimulus presented outside the CRF and found that cross-orientation suppression begins substantially earlier than surround suppression measured in the same cells. Together, these findings suggest that cross-orientation suppression is attributable to either direct feedforward signal paths to V1 neurons or a circuit involving fast local interneurons within V1. Feedback from higher cortical areas is implicated in surround suppression, but our results make this an implausible mechanism for cross-orientation suppression. We conclude that suppression from inside and outside the CRF occur through different mechanisms.},

Thus, binding invokes combinatorial processing of related features whereas selective attention emphasizes differential processing. We hypothesized that binding and selective feature-based attention depend on a common resource and therefore might show interference effects. The current study tested this by manipulating binding demands while human participants directed their attention to the color or motion of moving random dot stimuli. Response time measures showed that effects of biased attention were reduced when binding demands were increased. This finding supports the thesis that binding relies, at least in part, upon the same mechanisms invoked by preparatory biasing of selective attention.},

Endogenous, or ‘top-down’, selective attention to basic visual features such as color or motion is a common strategy for biasing resources in favor of the most relevant information sources in a given context. Opposing this top-down separation of features is a ‘bottom-up’ tendency to integrate, or bind, the various features that constitute objects. We pitted these two processes against each other in an electrophysiological experiment to test if top-down selective attention can overcome constitutive binding processes. Our results demonstrate that bottom-up binding processes can dominate top-down feature-based attention even when explicitly detrimental to task performance.

Numerous studies have shown that correlations can be dynamically modified by attention, adaptation, learning, and potent stimulus drive. However, the mechanisms that influence correlation strength remain poorly understood. Here we test whether correlations are influenced by presenting stimuli outside the classical receptive field (RF) of visual neurons, where they recruit a normalization signal termed surround suppression. We recorded simultaneously the activity of dozens of cells using microelectrode arrays implanted in the superficial layers of V1 in anesthetized, paralyzed macaque monkeys. We presented annular stimuli that encircled--but did not impinge upon--the RFs of the recorded cells. We found that these “extra-classical” stimuli reduced correlations in the absence of stimulation of the RF, closely resembling the decorrelating effects of stimulating the RFs directly. Our results suggest that normalization signals may be an important mechanism for modulating correlations.},

abstract = {Several parallel pathways convey retinal signals to the visual cortex of primates. The signals of the parvocellular (P) and magnocellular (M) pathways are well characterized; the properties of other rarely encountered cell types are distinctive in many ways, but it is not clear that they can provide signals with the same fidelity. Here we study this by characterizing the temporal receptive field of neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus of anesthetized marmosets. For each neuron, we measured the response to a flickering uniform field, and, from this, estimated the linear and nonlinear receptive fields using spike-triggered average (STA) and spike-triggered covariance (STC) analyses. As expected the response of most P-cells was dominated by the STA, but the response of most M-cells required additional nonlinear components, and these usually acted to suppress cell responses. The STC analysis showed stronger suppressive axes in suppressed-by-contrast cells, and both suppressive and excitatory axes in on-off cells. Together, the STA and the STC analyses form a model of the temporal response to a large uniform field: under this model, the information that was provided by suppressed-by-contrast cells or on-off cells approached that provided by the P- and M-cells. However, whereas P- and M-cells provided more information about luminance, the nonlinear cells provided more information about the contrast energy. This suggests that the nonlinear cells provide complimentary signals to those of P- and M-cells, with reasonably high fidelity, and may play an important role in normal visual processing.},

abstract = {Stimulation of the suppressive surround of a cortical neuron affects the responsivity and tuning of the classical receptive field (CRF) on several stimulus dimensions. In V1 and V2 of macaques prepared for acute electrophysiological experiments, we explored the chromatic sensitivity of the surround and its influence on the chromatic tuning of the CRF. We studied receptive fields of single neurons with patches of drifting grating of optimal spatial frequency and orientation and variable size, modulated along achromatic or isoluminant color directions. The responses of most neurons declined as the patch was enlarged beyond the optimal size (surround suppression). In V1 the suppression evoked by isoluminant gratings was less than one-half that evoked by achromatic gratings. Consequently, many cells were most sensitive to achromatic modulation when patches just covered the CRF but were most sensitive to isoluminant modulation when patches were enlarged to cover the suppressive surround. Non-oriented neurons that were strongly chromatically opponent generally lacked suppressive surrounds. In V2 most neurons showed equal surround suppression from isoluminant gratings and achromatic gratings. This makes the relative sensitivity of V2 neurons to achromatic and isoluminant gratings mainly independent of the size of the grating. We also measured the chromatic properties of the CRF in the presence of differently colored surrounds. In neither V1 nor V2 did the surround alter the chromatic tuning of the CRF. Cortical mechanisms sensitive to chromatic contrast seem to provide little input to the suppressive surrounds of V1 neurons but substantial input to those of V2 neurons.},

abstract = {Descriptions of receptive fields at subcortical levels of the visual system have mostly considered only the classical receptive field (CRF). A suppressive extraclassical receptive field (ECRF) has been demonstrated in relay cells within the primate lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), but the quantitative properties and specific influence of the ECRF on the distinct magnocellular (MC), koniocellular (KC), and parvocellular (PC) pathways are not known. Here we quantified the effect of ECRF stimulation on visually responsive cells in the LGN of a diurnal New World primate, the marmoset. We show that for all cells, visually evoked responses are reduced by stimulation of the ECRF. The magnitude of the suppression is greatest for MC cells and smallest for PC cells. The effect of ECRF stimulation on KC cells is variable but always suppressive. We refer to these effects as extraclassical inhibition (ECI). The contrast-response relationship of the ECI parallels that of CRF-induced excitation for each cell class: for MC cells, ECI contrast threshold is close to 10% and the ECI saturates at 50% contrast, but the contrast dependence of ECI on PC cells is more linear. The ECI also contributes to contrast-dependent changes in spatial summation: on average for all LGN cells the radius of the excitatory spatial summation field (measured from aperture-tuning curves) at low contrast is 1.31 times that at high contrast. No consistent effects of orientation on ECI were seen. The data suggest that the suppressive component of the ECRF seen in cortical neurons could primarily be inherited from subcortical input streams.},

abstract = {Integration of inputs by cortical neurons provides the basis for the complex information processing performed in the cerebral cortex. Here, we have examined how primary visual cortical neurons integrate classical and nonclassical receptive field inputs. The effect of nonclassical receptive field stimuli and, correspondingly, of long-range intracortical inputs is known to be context-dependent: the same long-range stimulus can either facilitate or suppress responses, depending on the level of local activation. By constructing a large-scale model of primary visual cortex, we demonstrate that this effect can be understood in terms of the local cortical circuitry. Each receptive field position contributes both excitatory and inhibitory inputs; however, the inhibitory inputs have greater influence when overall receptive field drive is greater. This mechanism also explains contrast-dependent modulations within the classical receptive field, which similarly switch between excitatory and inhibitory. In order to simplify analysis and to explain the fundamental mechanisms of the model, self-contained modules that capture nonlinear local circuit interactions are constructed. This work supports the notion that receptive field integration is the result of local processing within small groups of neurons rather than in single neurons Type: JOURNAL ARTICLE Language: Eng},

Although it is largely accepted that attention modulates neural activity in extrastriate visual cortex, the extent to which attention operates in the first cortical stage, striate visual cortex (area V1), remains controversial. Here, functional MRI was used at high field strength (3 T) to study humans during attentionally demanding visual discriminations. Similar, robust attentional modulations were observed in both striate and extrastriate cortical areas. Functional mapping of cortical retinotopy demonstrates that attentional modulations were spatially specific, enhancing responses to attended stimuli and suppressing responses when attention was directed elsewhere. The spatial pattern of modulation reveals a complex attentional window that is consistent with object-based attention but is inconsistent with a simple attentional spotlight. These data suggest that neural processing in V1 is not governed simply by sensory stimulation, but, like extrastriate regions, V1 can be strongly and specifically influenced by attention Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

The other cell types did not accumulate the amino acid. Twelve of the labelled neurons were drawn. Eight were bitufted neurons with their dendrites oriented predominantly radially, three were small multipolar neurons, and one could be reconstructed only partially. One neuron had a locally arborizing axon in layer III. Two bitufted, Golgi-impregnated neurons in layer II and upper III of area 18 were labelled from GABA injection radially beneath in layer VI, providing evidence for earlier suggestions that in the monkey’s visual cortex the cells in the upper layers which project radially and accumulate 3H-GABA are aspiny non-pyramidal cells.

abstract = {Several lines of evidence suggest that gamma-aminobutyric acid is an inhibitory neurotransmitter in the cerebral cortex. To study the intracortical projection of neurons that selectively accumulate this amino acid, we injected radioactive gamma-aminobutyric acid into the upper layers of the striate cortex of monkeys along tracks at an oblique angle to the pia. Sections from the injected area were then processed by a combination of autoradiography and Golgi impregnation to reveal the distribution of labeled neurons and their morphological characteristics. Labeled neurons always occurred around the injection site in each layer. In addition, a consistent radial pattern of perikaryal labeling was observed in layers IVc-VI below the injection track in layers I-IVa. The closer the injection track was to the pia the deeper the peak density of labeled cells appeared. After injection in layers IVa and the lower part of III, the highest number of labeled neurons was in layer IVc; after injection in the upper part of layer III, most labeled neurons were in layer V; and, after injection in layers I and II, the proportion of labeled neurons increased in the lower part of layer V and in layer VI. All these neurons in the infragranular layers are presumably labeled by retrograde axonal transport via the labeled fiber bundles that extended from upper to lower layers. Thirty-four Golgi-stained neurons of various types were also examined for retrograde labeling. Two were labeled, and both were aspiny stellate cells in layer V. The arrangement of these putative GABAergic neurones, with axons that ascend from lower to upper layers in a regular pattern and arborize locally, would enable them to mediate inhibition within cortical columns and between neighboring columns.},

journal = {Visual Neuroscience}, 
volume = {23}, 
number = {2}, 
pages = {181–199}, 
year = {2006}, 
abstract = {The discontinuities of phase-shifted abutting line gratings give rise to perception of an “illusory contour” (IC) along the line terminations. Neuronal responses to such ICs have been interpreted as evidence for a specialized visual mechanism, since such responses cannot be predicted from conventional linear receptive fields. However, when the spatial scale of the component gratings (carriers) is large compared to the neuron’s luminance passband, these IC responses might be evoked simply by the luminance edges at the line terminations. Thus by presenting abutting gratings at a series of carrier spatial scales to cat A18 neurons, we were able to distinguish genuine nonlinear responses from those due to luminance edges. Around half of the neurons (both simple and complex types) showed a bimodal response pattern to abutting gratings: one peak at a low carrier spatial frequency range that overlapped with the luminance passband, and a second distinct peak at much higher frequencies beyond the neuron’s grating resolution. For those bimodally responding neurons, the low-frequency responses were sensitive to carrier phase, but the high-frequency responses were phase-invariant. Thus the responses at low carrier spatial frequencies could be understood via a linear model, while the higher frequency responses represented genuine nonlinear IC processing. IC responsive neurons also demonstrated somewhat lower spatial preference to the periodic contours (envelopes) compared to gratings, but the optimal orientation and motion direction for both were quite similar. The nonlinear responses to ICs could be explained by the same energy mechanism underlying responses to second-order stimuli such as contrast-modulated gratings. Similar neuronal preferences for ICs and for gratings may contribute to the form-cue invariant perception of moving contours.},

abstract = {We examined the coordination of saccades and reaches in a visual search task in which monkeys were rewarded for reaching to an odd-colored target among distractors. Eye movements were unconstrained, and monkeys typically made one or more saccades before initiating a reach. Target selection for reaching and saccades was highly correlated with the hand and eyes landing near the same final stimulus both for correct reaches to the target and for incorrect reaches to a distractor. Incorrect reaches showed a bias in target selection: they were directed to the distractor in the same hemifield as the target more often than to other distractors. A similar bias was seen in target selection for the initial saccade in correct reaching trials with multiple saccades. We also examined the temporal coupling of saccades and reaches. In trials with a single saccade, a reaching movement was made after a fairly stereotyped delay. In multiple-saccade trials, a reach to the target could be initiated near or even before the onset of the final target-directed saccade. In these trials, the initial trajectory of the reach was often directed toward the fixated distractor before veering toward the target around the time of the final saccade. In virtually all cases, the eyes arrived at the target before the hand, and remained fixated until reach completion. Overall, these results are consistent with flexible temporal coupling of saccade and reach initiation, but fairly tight coupling of target selection for the two types of action.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: How it is possible to “faithfully” represent a three-dimensional stereoscopic scene using Cartesian coordinates on a plane, and how three-dimensional perceptions differ between an actual scene and an image of the same scene are questions that have not yet been explored in depth. They seem like commonplace phenomena, but in fact, they are important and difficult issues for visual information processing, neural computation, physics, psychology, cognitive psychology, and neuroscience. RESULTS: The results of this study show that the use of plenoptic (or all-optical) functions and their dual plane parameterizations can not only explain the nature of information processing from the retina to the primary visual cortex and, in particular, the characteristics of the visual pathway’s optical system and its affine transformation, but they can also clarify the reason why the vanishing point and line exist in a visual image. In addition, they can better explain the reasons why a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system can be introduced into the two-dimensional plane to express a real three-dimensional scene. CONCLUSIONS: 1. We introduce two different mathematical expressions of the plenoptic functions, Pw and Pv that can describe the objective world. We also analyze the differences between these two functions when describing visual depth perception, that is, the difference between how these two functions obtain the depth information of an external scene.2. The main results include a basic method for introducing a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system into a two-dimensional plane to express the depth of a scene, its constraints, and algorithmic implementation. In particular, we include a method to separate the plenoptic function and proceed with the corresponding transformation in the retina and visual cortex.3. We propose that size constancy, the vanishing point, and vanishing line form the basis of visual perception of the outside world, and that the introduction of a three-dimensional Cartesian coordinate system into a two dimensional plane reveals a corresponding mapping between a retinal image and the vanishing point and line.},

abstract = {The gut is home to trillions of microorganisms that have fundamental roles in many aspects of human biology, including immune function and metabolism. The reduced diversity of the gut microbiota in Western populations compared to that in populations living traditional lifestyles presents the question of which factors have driven microbiota change during modernization. Microbiota-accessible carbohydrates (MACs) found in dietary fibre have a crucial involvement in shaping this microbial ecosystem, and are notably reduced in the Western diet (high in fat and simple carbohydrates, low in fibre) compared with a more traditional diet. Here we show that changes in the microbiota of mice consuming a low-MAC diet and harbouring a human microbiota are largely reversible within a single generation. However, over several generations, a low-MAC diet results in a progressive loss of diversity, which is not recoverable after the reintroduction of dietary MACs. To restore the microbiota to its original state requires the administration of missing taxa in combination with dietary MAC consumption. Our data illustrate that taxa driven to low abundance when dietary MACs are scarce are inefficiently transferred to the next generation, and are at increased risk of becoming extinct within an isolated population. As more diseases are linked to the Western microbiota and the microbiota is targeted therapeutically, microbiota reprogramming may need to involve strategies that incorporate dietary MACs as well as taxa not currently present in the Western gut.},

In X cells these subunits may correspond to individual cone bipolar inputs. In Y cells, the subunits may reflect the structure of the dendritic tree.

abstract = {Single neuron firing is often analyzed relative to an external event, such as successful task performance, or the delivery of a stimulus. The peri-event time histogram (PETH) examines how - on average - neural firing modulates before and after the alignment event. However, the PETH contains no information about the single-trial reliability of the neural response, which is important from the point of view of a target neuron. In this paper, we propose the concept of using the neural activity to predict the timing of the occurrence of an event, as opposed to using the event to predict the neural response. We firstly estimate the likelihood of an observed spike train, under the assumption that it was generated by an inhomogeneous gamma process with rate profile similar to the PETH shifted by a small time. This is used to generate a probability distribution of the event occurrence, using Bayes’ rule. By an information theoretic approach, this method yields a single value (in bits) which quantifies the reduction in uncertainty regarding the time of an external event following observation of the spike train. We show that the approach is sensitive to the amplitude of a response, to the level of baseline firing, and to the consistency of a response between trials, all of which are factors that will impact a neuron’s ability to code for the time of the event. The technique can provide a useful means of determining which of several behavioral events a cell encodes best, as well as permitting objective comparison of different cell populations.},

Human subjects were presented with a visual search array that was repeated up to 4 times, while brain activity was recorded using magnetoencephalography (MEG). Behaviorally, we observed a bimodal reaction time distribution for resumed visual search, indicating that subjects were extraordinarily rapid on a proportion of trials. MEG data demonstrated that these rapid-response trials were associated with a prediction of (1) target location, as reflected by alpha-band (8-12 Hz) lateralization; and (2) target identity, as reflected by beta-band (15-30 Hz) lateralization. Moreover, we show that these predictions are likely generated in a network consisting of medial superior frontal cortex and right temporo-parietal junction. These findings underscore the importance and nature of perceptual hypotheses for efficient visual search.},

year = {1990}, 
abstract = {1. Fifty-eight area 18 cells recorded in anesthetized and paralyzed cats were tested for selectivity for direction in depth after their monocular velocity characteristics and static disparity profile were determined. 2. Direction in depth was produced by changing the speed and direction in the two eyes, but keeping the speed along axes in depth constant. 3. Forty-two cells were completely investigated, which means that direction in depth selectivity was tested at least at two different position disparities and two different bar speeds. Seven out of the 42 cells were accepted as direction in depth selective. 4. The 16 remaining cells were incompletely tested. Only one of them was direction in depth selective at the disparity and speed tested and shared all the properties of the seven completely tested direction in depth selective cells. Therefore we estimated that 8/58, i.e., 14% of the area 18 cells are direction in depth selective. 5. The direction in depth selective cells are a very homogeneous class: they all belong to the S family, are velocity tuned, monocular, prefer orientations close to vertical, and have a broad inhibitory or an unmodulated position disparity profile. 6. Direction in depth selectivity arises both from monocular properties and binocular interactions. These binocular interaction profiles can be symmetric or asymmetric. The change of these interaction profiles with changes in base speed can be summarized as changes in level of inhibition for the axes corresponding to equal speed in the two eyes on one hand and changes in the slope of the inhibition gradient centered on these axes of equal speed on the other hand. 7. Nineteen of the 58 cells were tested for selectivity for speed along trajectories in depth. All five direction in depth selective cells tested were also tuned to speed in depth. This suggests that area 18 contributes to the elaboration of a 3D velocity map. 8. A wiring diagram that accounts for the binocular interactions underlying direction selectivity in depth is presented.},

journal = {J. Vis.}, 
volume = {15}, 
number = {9}, 
pages = {7}, 
year = {2015}, 
abstract = {Following the pioneering studies of the receptive field (RF), the RF concept gained further significance for visual perception by the discovery of input effects from beyond the classical RF. These studies demonstrated that neuronal responses could be modulated by stimuli outside their RFs, consistent with the perception of induced brightness, color, orientation, and motion. Lesion scotomata are similarly modulated perceptually from the surround by RFs that have migrated from the interior to the outer edge of the scotoma and in this way provide filling-in of the void. Large RFs are advantageous to this task. In higher visual areas, such as the middle temporal and inferotemporal lobe, RFs increase in size and lose most of their retinotopic organization while encoding increasingly complex features. Whereas lower-level RFs mediate perceptual filling-in, contour integration, and figure-ground segregation, RFs at higher levels serve the perception of grouping by common fate, biological motion, and other biologically relevant stimuli, such as faces. Studies in alert monkeys while freely viewing natural scenes showed that classical and nonclassical RFs cooperate in forming representations of the visual world. Today, our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the RF is undergoing a quantum leap. What had started out as a hierarchical feed-forward concept for simple stimuli, such as spots, lines, and bars, now refers to mechanisms involving ascending, descending, and lateral signal flow. By extension of the bottom-up paradigm, RFs are nowadays understood as adaptive processors, enabling the predictive coding of complex scenes. Top-down effects guiding attention and tuned to task-relevant information complement the bottom-up analysis.},

These properties support a variety of coincidence-detection mechanisms, which are likely to be crucial for synaptic integration and plasticity.},

abstract = {The response of a population of cortical neurons to an external stimulus depends not only on the receptive field properties of the neurons, but also the level of arousal and attention or goal-oriented cognitive biases that guide information processing. These top-down effects on cortical neurons bias the output of the neurons and affect behavioral outcomes such as stimulus detection, discrimination, and response time. In any physiological study, neural dynamics are observed in a specific brain state; the background state partly determines neuronal excitability. Experimental studies in humans and animal models have also demonstrated that slow oscillations (typically in the alpha or theta bands) modulate the fast oscillations (gamma band) associated with local networks of neurons. Cross-frequency interaction is of interest as a mechanism for top-down or bottom up interactions between systems at different spatial scales. We develop a generic model of top-down influences on local networks appropriate for comparison with EEG. EEG provides excellent temporal resolution to investigate neuronal oscillations but is space-averaged on the cm scale. Thus, appropriate EEG models are developed in terms of population synaptic activity. We used the Wilson-Cowan population model to investigate fast (gamma band) oscillations generated by a local network of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. We modified the Wilson-Cowan equations to make them more physiologically realistic by explicitly incorporating background state variables into the model. We found that the population response is strongly influenced by the background state. We apply the model to reproduce the modulation of gamma rhythms by theta rhythms as has been observed in animal models and human ECoG and EEG studies. The concept of a dynamic background state presented here using the Wilson-Cowan model can be readily applied to incorporate top-down modulation in more detailed models of specific cortical systems.},

abstract = {Stimulus expectation can modulate neural responses in early sensory cortical regions, with expected stimuli often leading to a reduced neural response. However, it is unclear whether this expectation suppression is an automatic phenomenon or is instead dependent on the type of task a subject is engaged in. To investigate this, human subjects were presented with visual grating stimuli in the periphery that were either predictable or non-predictable while they performed three tasks that differently engaged cognitive resources. In two of the tasks, the predictable stimulus was task-irrelevant and spatial attention was engaged at fixation, with a high load on either perceptual or working memory resources. In the third task, the predictable stimulus was task-relevant, and therefore spatially attended. We observed that expectation suppression is dependent on the cognitive resources engaged by a subjects’ current task. When the grating was task-irrelevant, expectation suppression for predictable items was visible in retinotopically specific areas of early visual cortex (V1-V3) during the perceptual task, but it was abolished when working memory was loaded. When the grating was task-relevant and spatially attended, there was no significant effect of expectation in early visual cortex. These results suggest that expectation suppression is not an automatic phenomenon, but dependent on attentional state and type of available cognitive resources.},

Measuring the time consumed by the perceptual evaluation step alone is therefore complicated by factors such as motor preparation, task difficulty and speed-accuracy tradeoffs. Here we present a task design that minimizes these confounding factors and allows us to track a subject’s perceptual performance with unprecedented temporal resolution. We find that monkeys can make accurate color discriminations in less than 30 ms. Furthermore, our simple task design provides a tool for elucidating how neuronal activity relates to sensory as opposed to motor processing, as demonstrated with neural data from cortical oculomotor neurons. In these cells, perceptual information acts by accelerating and decelerating the ongoing motor plans associated with correct and incorrect choices, as predicted by a race-to-threshold model, and the time course of these neural events parallels the time course of the subject’s choice accuracy.},

We report that the occurrence of synchronous firing of cat thalamic cells with highly overlapping receptive fields is strongly sensitive to the orientation and the direction of motion of the visual stimulus. We show that this stimulus selectivity is robust, remaining relatively unchanged under different contrasts and temporal frequencies (stimulus velocities). A computational analysis based on an integrate-and-fire model of the direct thalamic input to a layer 4 cortical cell reveals a strong correlation between the degree of thalamic synchrony and the nonlinear relationship between cortical membrane potential and the resultant firing rate. Together, these findings suggest a novel population code in the synchronous firing of neurons in the early visual pathway that could serve as the substrate for establishing cortical representations of the visual scene.},

journal = {Schizophrenia Bulletin}, 
volume = {},

pages = {}, 
year = {2009}, 
abstract = {Over the last 2 decades, a large number of neurophysiological and neuroimaging studies of patients with schizophrenia have furnished in vivo evidence for dysconnectivity, ie, abnormal functional integration of brain processes. While the evidence for dysconnectivity in schizophrenia is strong, its etiology, pathophysiological mechanisms, and significance for clinical symptoms are unclear. First, dysconnectivity could result from aberrant wiring of connections during development, from aberrant synaptic plasticity, or from both. Second, it is not clear how schizophrenic symptoms can be understood mechanistically as a consequence of dysconnectivity. Third, if dysconnectivity is the primary pathophysiology, and not just an epiphenomenon, then it should provide a mechanistic explanation for known empirical facts about schizophrenia. This article addresses these 3 issues in the framework of the dysconnection hypothesis. This theory postulates that the core pathology in schizophrenia resides in aberrant N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR)–mediated synaptic plasticity due to abnormal regulation of NMDARs by neuromodulatory transmitters like dopamine, serotonin, or acetylcholine. We argue that this neurobiological mechanism can explain failures of self-monitoring, leading to a mechanistic explanation for first-rank symptoms as pathognomonic features of schizophrenia, and may provide a basis for future diagnostic classifications with physiologically defined patient subgroups. Finally, we test the explanatory power of our theory against a list of empirical facts about schizophrenia.},

abstract = {A slow (0.5-4 Hz) oscillation of thalamic neurons was recently described and attributed to the interplay of two intrinsic currents. In this study, we investigated the network modulation of this intrinsic thalamic oscillation within the frequency range of EEG sleep delta-waves. We performed intracellular and extracellular recordings of antidromically identified thalamocortical cells (n = 305) in sensory, motor, associational, and intralaminar nuclei of anesthetized cats. At the resting membrane potential, Vm (-60.3 +/- 0.4 mV, mean +/- SE), cortical stimulation induced spindle-like oscillations (7-14 Hz), whereas at Vm more negative than -65 mV the same stimuli triggered an oscillation within the EEG delta-frequency (0.5-4 Hz), consisting of low-threshold spikes (LTSs) followed by after hyperpolarizing potentials (AHPs). The LTS-AHP sequences outlasted cortical stimuli as a self-sustained rhythmicity at 1-2 Hz. Corticothalamic stimuli were able to transform subthreshold slow (0.5-4 Hz) oscillations, occurring spontaneously at Vm more negative than -65 mV, into rhythmic LTSs crowned by bursts of Na+ spikes that persisted for 10-20 sec after cessation of cortical volleys. Cortical volleys also revived a hyperpolarization-activated slow oscillation when it dampened after a few cycles. Auto- and crosscorrelograms of neuronal pairs revealed that unrelated cells became synchronized after a series of corticothalamic stimuli, with both neurons displaying rhythmic (1-2 Hz) bursts or spike trains. Since delta-thalamic oscillations, prevailing during late sleep stages, are triggered at more negative Vm than spindles characterizing the early sleep stage, we postulate a progressive hyperpolarization of thalamocortical neurons with the deepening of the behavioral state of EEG-synchronized sleep. In view of the evidence that cortical-elicited slow oscillations depend on synaptically induced hyperpolarization of thalamocortical cells, we propose that the potentiating influence of the corticothalamic input results from the engagement of two GABAergic thalamic cell classes, reticular and local-circuit neurons. The thalamocorticothalamic loop would transfer the spike bursts of thalamic oscillating cells to cortical targets, which in turn would reinforce the oscillation by direct pathways and/or indirect projections relayed by reticular and local-circuit thalamic cells. Stimulation of mesopontine cholinergic [peribrachial (PB) and laterodorsal tegmental (LDT)] nuclei in monoamine-depleted animals had an effect that was opposite to that exerted by corticothalamic volleys. PB/LDT stimulation reduced or suppressed the slow (1-4 Hz) oscillatory bursts of high-frequency spikes in thalamic cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Specific relay nuclei receive less than 10% of their brainstem afferents from non-cholinergic neurons located at rostral midbrain levels and receive 85-96% of their brainstem innervation from a region at midbrain-pontine junction where the cholinergic peribrachial area and laterodorsal tegmental nucleus are maximally developed. Of the total number of horseradish peroxidase-positive brainstem neurons seen after injections in various specific relay nuclei, the double-labeled (horseradish peroxidase + choline acetyltransferase) neurons represent approximately 70-85%. Three to eight times more numerous horseradish peroxidase-labeled brainstem cells were found after injections in associational (mediodorsal and pulvinar-lateral posterior complex) and diffusely cortically-projecting (ventromedial) thalamic nuclei of cat than after injections in specific relay nuclei. The striking retrograde cell labeling observed after injections in nuclei with associative functions and widespread cortical projections was due to massive afferentation from non-cholinergic parts of the midbrain and pontine reticular formation, on both ipsi- and contralateral sides. After wheat germ agglutinin-horseradish peroxidase injections in the associative pulvinar-lateral posterior complex and mediodorsal nucleus of Macaca sylvana, 45-50% of horseradish peroxidase-positive brainstem peribrachial neurons were also choline acetyltransferase-positive. While cells in the medial part of the cholinergic peribrachial area were found to project especially towards the pulvinar-lateral posterior nuclear complex in monkey, the retrograde cell labeling seen after the mediodorsal injection was mostly confined to the lateral part of both dorsal and ventral aspects of the peribrachial area.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

To more closely characterize the mechanisms underlying these activations, we performed analyses of effective connectivity and found that the AM-induced activations on the illusory AM path were associated with enhanced feedback (but not feedforward) connectivity from hMT+/V5. These findings provide for the first time evidence for the involvement of cortico-cortical coupling in generating an illusory percept of AM. They therefore emphasize the role of recurrent processing between visual cortical areas in human perceptual awareness.},

However, this judgment may be confounded by changing delays in sensory pathways, suggesting the need for dynamic temporal recalibration. To test for such a mechanism, we artificially injected a fixed delay between participants’ actions (keypresses) and subsequent sensations (flashes). After participants adapted to this delay, flashes at unexpectedly short delays after the keypress were often perceived as occurring before the keypress, demonstrating a recalibration of motor-sensory temporal order judgments. When participants experienced illusory reversals, fMRI BOLD signals increased in anterior cingulate cortex/medial frontal cortex (ACC/MFC), a brain region previously implicated in conflict monitoring. This illusion-specific activation suggests that the brain maintains not only a recalibrated representation of timing, but also a less-plastic representation against which to compare it.},

We report that independent inputs cannot account for this high variability, but this variability can be explained by a simple alternative model of the synaptic drive in which inputs arrive synchronously. Our results suggest that synchrony may be important in the neural code by providing a means for encoding signals with high temporal fidelity over a population of neurons},

Here we investigate the effect of GABAergic PSPs on spike timing in cortical neurons that exhibit an oscillatory modulation of their membrane potential. To this end we combined numerical simulations with in-vitro patch-clamp recordings from layer II/III pyramidal cells of the rat visual cortex. Special emphasis was placed on exploring how the reversal potential of the GABAergic synaptic currents (E(GABA)) and the phase relations of the PSPs relative to the oscillation cycles affect the timing of spikes riding on the depolarizing peaks of the oscillations. The simulations predicted: (1) With E(GABA) more negative than the oscillation minima PSPs are hyperpolarizing at all phases and thus delay or prevent spikes. (2) With E(GABA) being more positive than the oscillation maxima PSPs are depolarizing in a phase-independent way and lead to a phase advance of spikes. (3) In the intermediate case where E(GABA) lies within oscillation maxima and minima PSPs are either hyper- or depolarizing depending on their phase relations to the V(m) oscillations and can therefore either delay or advance spikes. Experiments conducted in this most interesting last configuration with biphasic PSPs agreed with the model predictions. Additional theoretical investigations revealed the effect of these PSP induced shifts in spike timing on synchronization in neuronal circuits. The results suggest that GABAergic mechanisms can assume highly specific timing functions in oscillatory},

Physiological properties such as cell’s membrane potentials, spike outputs, and temporal characteristics change systematically with map location. We investigate in a firing rate and a Hodgkin-Huxley network model what constraints these tuning characteristics of V1 neurons impose on the cortical operating regime. Systematically varying the strength of both recurrent excitation and inhibition, we test a wide range of model classes and find the likely models to account for the experimental observations. We show that recent intracellular and extracellular recordings from cat V1 provide the strongest evidence for a regime where excitatory and inhibitory recurrent inputs are balanced and dominate the feed-forward input. Our results are robust against changes in model assumptions such as spatial extent and strength of lateral inhibition. Intriguingly, the most likely recurrent regime is in a region of parameter space where small changes have large effects on the network dynamics, and it is close to a regime of “runaway excitation,” where the network shows strong self-sustained activity. This could make the cortical response particularly sensitive to modulation.},

This allowed us to infer the shape of the prior probability as well as the internal noise characteristics directly from psychophysical data. For all subjects, we found that the fitted model provides an accurate description of the data across a wide range of stimulus parameters. The inferred prior distribution shows significantly heavier tails than a Gaussian, and the amplitude of the internal noise is approximately proportional to stimulus speed and depends inversely on stimulus contrast. The framework is general and should prove applicable to other experiments and perceptual modalities.},

Spike activity of 67 neurons (48 simple, 19 complex cells) was extracellulary recorded from area 17/18 of anesthetized and paralyzed cats. A total of 107 subfields (on/off) were mapped by applying a reverse correlation technique to the activity elicited by bright and dark rectangles flashed for 300 ms in a 20x10 grid. We found that the width of the (suprathreshold) discharge fields shrank on average by 22% during this 300-ms-long stimulus presentation time. Fifty-eight subfields (54%) shrank by more than 20% of peak width and only ten (less than 10%) showed a slight increase over time. The main size reduction took place 40-60 ms after response onset, which corresponded to the transition from transient peak firing to tonic visual activity in thalamocortical relay cells (TC). The experimentally obtained RFs were then fitted with the aid of a neural field model of the primary visual pathway. Assuming a Gaussian-shaped spatial sensitivity profile across the RF subfield width, the model allowed us to estimate the subthreshold RF (depolarization field, D-field) from the minimal discharge field (MDF). The model allowed us to test to what degree the temporal dynamics of thalamocortical activity contributes to the spatiotemporal changes of cortical RFs. To this end, we performed the fitting procedure either with a pure feedforward model or with a field model that also included intracortical feedback. Spatial and temporal parameters obtained from fits of the experimental RFs matched closely to those achieved by simulating a pure feedforward system with the field model but were not compatible with additional intracortical feedback. Thus, our results show that dot stimulation, which optimally excites thalamocortical cells, leads to a shrinkage with respect to the size of the RF subfield at the first transient response of visual cortical RFs which seems mainly due to a change in the thalamic firing pattern. In these experiments little or no influence from intracortical sources was observed, which, however, may play a role when using more complex visual stimuli.},

We determined the response properties of ~28,000 thalamic boutons and ~4,000 cortical neurons in layers 1–5 of awake mouse V1. Using adaptive optics that allows accurate measurement of bouton activity deep in cortex, we found that around half of the boutons in the main thalamorecipient L4 carried orientation-tuned information and that their orientation and direction biases were also dominant in the L4 neuron population, suggesting that these neurons may inherit their selectivity from tuned thalamic inputs. Cortical neurons in all layers exhibited sharper tuning than thalamic boutons and a greater diversity of preferred orientations.

The results demonstrate that the ECRF of most relay cells in the LGNd responded preferentially to a grating stimulus of low spatial frequency through a mechanism of spatial summation. These biased cells showed a significant orientation bias which was relatively smaller than that of the CRF. The preferred orientations of the ECRF were not correlated with those of the CRF in most relay cells. The orientation biased ECRFs and CRFs interacted with each other in a non-linear way, resulting in a great diversity of response properties. Overall, the CRF played a more significant role than the ECRF in determining a cell’s orientation bias and preferred orientation. The ECRF mostly showed a modulatory role mainly in suppressing and/or in partially facilitating the neural response to stimulation in the CRF although in some cases, the ECRF did determine a cell’s responsiveness and orientation sensitivity.These results suggest that the ECRF might contribute to the ability of the LGNd neurons to detect some complex features such as texture segmentation and provide a subcortical contribution to the integrative field of visual cortical cells through receiving inputs from retinal ganglion cells with similar orientation biased extended surrounds [Neuroscience 98 (2000) 207].},

An even stronger connection is drawn between the Weber–Fechner law and a Bayesian framework when neural storage or communication is the dominant concern, such as for numerosity. Theoretical results and experimental verification for perception of sound intensity are both presented.},

Small latency differences, though hard to detect, can potentially be of functional importance, and may also give insight into the mechanisms of neuronal computation. We therefore reexamined the effect of attention on the response latency of both single units and the local field potential (LFP) in primate visual cortical area V4. We find that attention does produce small (1–2 ms) but significant reductions in the latency of both the spiking and LFP responses. Though attention, like contrast elevation, reduces response latencies, we find that the two have different effects on the magnitude of the LFP. Contrast elevations increase and attention decreases the magnitude of the initial deflection of the stimulus-evoked LFP. Both contrast elevation and attention increase the magnitude of the spiking response. We speculate that latencies may be reduced at higher contrast because stronger stimulus inputs drive neurons more rapidly to spiking threshold, while attention may reduce latencies by placing neurons in a more depolarized state closer to threshold before stimulus onset.},

Such a late onset indicates an involvement of feedback projections from higher visual areas. To investigate the possible role of feedback in figure-ground perception we removed dorsal extra-striate areas of the monkey visual cortex. The findings show that figure-ground perception is reduced when the figure is presented in the lesioned hemifield and perception is normal when the figure appeared in the intact hemifield.

Our computer model data show that without feedback, neurons respond with regular low-frequency (∼9 Hz) bursting to a figure-ground stimulus. After including feedback the firing pattern changed into a regular (tonic) spiking pattern. In this state, we found an extra enhancement of figure responses and a further suppression of background responses resulting in a stronger figure-ground signal. Such push-pull effect was confirmed by comparing the figure-ground responses with the responses to a homogenous texture. We propose that feedback controls figure-ground segregation by influencing the neural firing patterns of feedforward projecting neurons.},

However, other models argue that the masking interferes with recurrent or reentrant processing. Using computer modeling, we show that surround inhibition evoked by ON and OFF responses to the mask suppresses the responses to a briefly presented stimulus in forward and backward masking paradigms. Our model results resemble several previously described psychophysical and neurophysiological findings in perceptual masking experiments and are in line with earlier theoretical descriptions of masking.

These emergent percepts appear as depth segregation, enhanced slow orientation rivalry, and oriented shimmer (a new phenomenon that cannot be explained in terms of conventional apparent motion or I temporal contrast illusions). These percepts resulted in up to an eightfold decrease in the coincidence detection threshold (alternations as fast as 20 ms/frame or 25 Hz) relative to control conditions that did not yield them; these sensitivity enhancements are unlikely to be due to temporal probability summation. The results provide psychophysical evidence that temporal-phase information can contribute to the parsing of overlapping patterns. (C) 2002. Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved},

Using fMRI, we characterized how visual cortical regions respond to the temporal selection of auditory and visual stimuli. Critically, we focused on brain regions that are not involved in processing the target itself. Participants pressed a button when they heard a prespecified target tone and did not respond to other tones. Although more attention was directed to auditory input when the target tone was selected, activity in primary visual cortex increased more after target tones than after distractor tones. In contrast to spatial attention, this effect was larger in V1 than in V2 and V3. It was present in regions not typically involved in representing the target stimulus. Additional experiments demonstrated that these effects were not due to multimodal processing, rare targets, or motor responses to the targets. Thus temporal selection of behaviorally relevant stimuli enhances, rather than reduces, activity in perceptual regions involved in processing other information.},

Saccades differentially modulate human LGN and V1 responses in the presence and absence of visual stimulation. Curr. Biol. 15, 37-41). Here, we explored this differential modulation further using graded changes in the strength of visual stimulation by changing the mean luminance of a flickering visual stimulus. We replicate the finding of differential modulation of activity in human LGN and V1, and show that this relationship also holds in retinotopic areas V2 and V3. Suppression of visually evoked activity during saccades was detectable during strong visual stimulation, but not during weaker stimulation. This suggests that the activation of visual cortex by saccades in darkness represents a signal that persists irrespective of the state of visual stimulation, masking suppressive effects of saccades when visual stimulation is weak. Such a signal may represent a motor signal in a sensory area. We discuss the possible role of oculomotor corollary discharge in changes in visual perception that occur peri-saccadically, which contribute to the successful negation of the disruptive effects of saccades on our seamless visual experience of the world.},

In some situations, this preparatory activity can predict how well human subjects will perceive upcoming visual objects. Preparatory activity may mediate this behavioral effect by affecting the stimulus-evoked response, but the relationship between preparatory and stimulus-evoked BOLD modulations is unclear. Here, we examine this relationship by comparing the effects of spatial attention on anticipatory and stimulus-evoked signals and by measuring the trial-to-trial correlation between prestimulus and poststimulus modulations. We find that in extrastriate visual cortex (V4), modulations related to spatial attention are relatively large, extend from prestimulus through the peak of the evoked response, and are slightly larger in the evoked response compared with the prestimulus response. In striate cortex (V1), the frontal eye fields (FEF), and the intraparietal sulcus (IPS), modulations related to spatial attention are relatively small, are confined primarily to the prestimulus period, and are slightly larger in preparatory versus stimulus-evoked activity. Importantly, across visual cortex, the attentional biases (activity for attended versus unattended locations) in preparatory and evoked activity are more positively correlated, trial-by-trial, than would be expected on the basis of activity measured in subjects at rest. We argue that this pattern of results suggests that the same mechanisms underlie preparatory and stimulus-evoked BOLD modulations related to spatial attention and that incoming sensory signals add to preexistent biases in preparatory activity to generate the stimulus-evoked response.},

It is thought that on-type signals for blue-yellow color vision are carried by cells in a distinct, diffusely projecting (koniocellular) pathway, but the pathway taken by blue-off signals is not known. Here, we measured blue-off responses in the subcortical visual pathway of marmoset monkeys. We found that the cells exhibiting blue-off responses are largely segregated to the koniocellular pathway. The blue-off cells show relatively large receptive fields, sluggish responses to maintained contrast, little sign of an inhibitory receptive-field surround mechanism, and negligible functional input from an intrinsic (melanopsin-based) phototransductive mechanism. These properties are consistent with input from koniocellular or “W-like” ganglion cells in the retina and suggest that blue-off cells, as previously shown for blue-on cells, could contribute to cortical mechanisms for visual perception via the koniocellular pathway.},

To a counterphase-modulated grating, the response was a phase-insensitive suppression modulated at twice the stimulus frequency, implying a receptive field comprised of multiple mechanisms that generate rectifying responses.

abstract = {The preferred stimulus size of a V1 neuron decreases with increases in stimulus contrast. It has been supposed that stimulus contrast is the primary determinant of such spatial summation in V1 cells, though the extent to which it depends on other stimulus attributes such as orientation and spatial frequency remains untested. We investigated this by recording from single cells in V1 of anaesthetized cats and monkeys, measuring size-tuning curves for high-contrast drifting gratings of optimal spatial configuration, and comparing these curves with those obtained at lower contrast or at sub-optimal orientations or spatial frequencies. For drifting gratings of optimal spatial configuration, lower contrasts produced less surround suppression resulting in increases in preferred size. High contrast gratings of sub-optimal spatial configuration produced more surround suppression than optimal low-contrast gratings, and as much or more surround suppression than optimal high-contrast gratings. For sub-optimal spatial frequencies, preferred size was similar to that for the optimal high-contrast stimulus, whereas for sub-optimal orientations, preferred size was smaller than that for the optimal high-contrast stimulus. These results indicate that, while contrast is an important determinant of spatial summation in V1, it is not the only determinant. Simulation of these experiments on a cortical receptive field modeled as a Gabor revealed that the small preferred sizes observed for non-preferred stimuli could result simply from linear filtering by the classical receptive field. Further simulations show that surround suppression in retinal ganglion cells and LGN cells can be propagated to neurons in V1, though certain properties of the surround seen in cortex indicate that it is not solely inherited from earlier stages of processing.},

abstract = {Spatial context in vision has profound effects on neural responses and perception. Recent animal studies suggest that the effect of surround on a central stimulus can dramatically change its character depending on the contrast of the center stimulus, but such a drastic change has not been demonstrated in the human visual cortex. To examine the dependency of the surround effect on the contrast of the center stimulus, we conducted an functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment by using a low or a high contrast in the center region while the surround contrast was sinusoidally modulated between the two contrasts. We found that the blood oxygen level-dependent response in human V1 corresponding to the center region was differentially modulated by the surround contrast, depending crucially on the center contrast: whereas a suppressive effect was observed in conditions in which the center contrast was high, a facilitative effect was seen in conditions where the center contrast was low.},

abstract = {The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) is increasingly regarded as a “smart-gating” operator for processing visual information. Therefore, characterizing the response properties of LGN neurons will enable us to better understand how neurons encode and transfer visual signals. Efforts have been devoted to study its anatomical and functional features, and recent advances have highlighted the existence in rodents of complex features such as direction/orientation selectivity. However, unlike well-researched higher-order mammals such as primates, the full array of response characteristics vis-à-vis its morphological features have remained relatively unexplored in the mouse LGN. To address the issue, we recorded from mouse LGN neurons using multisite-electrode-arrays (MEAs) and analysed their discharge patterns in relation to their location under a series of visual stimulation paradigms. Several response properties paralleled results from earlier studies in the field and these include centre-surround organization, size of receptive field, spontaneous firing rate and linearity of spatial summation. However, our results also revealed “high-pass” and “low-pass” features in the temporal frequency tuning of some cells, and greater average contrast gain than reported by earlier studies. In addition, a small proportion of cells had direction/orientation selectivity. Both “high-pass” and “low-pass” cells, as well as direction and orientation selective cells, were found only in small numbers, supporting the notion that these properties emerge in the cortex. ON- and OFF-cells showed distinct contrast sensitivity and temporal frequency tuning properties, suggesting parallel projections from the retina. Incorporating a novel histological technique, we created a 3-D LGN volume model explicitly capturing the morphological features of mouse LGN and localising individual cells into anterior/middle/posterior LGN. Based on this categorization, we show that the ON/OFF, DS/OS and linear response properties are not regionally restricted. Our study confirms earlier findings of spatial pattern selectivity in the LGN, and builds on it to demonstrate that relatively elaborate features are computed early in the visual pathway.},

Fixational eye movements scatter stimuli about the retina, inflating estimates of receptive field dimensions, reducing estimates of peak responses, and blurring maps of receptive field subregions. Scleral search coils are frequently used to measure eye position, but their utility for correcting the effects of fixational eye movements on receptive field maps has been questioned. Using eye coils sutured to the sclera and preamplifiers configured to minimize cable artifacts, we reexamined this issue in two rhesus monkeys. During repeated fixation trials, the eye position signal was used to adjust the stimulus position, compensating for eye movements and correcting the stimulus position to place it at the desired location on the retina. Estimates of response magnitudes and receptive field characteristics in V1 and in LGN were obtained in both compensated and uncompensated conditions. Receptive fields were narrower, with steeper borders, and response amplitudes were higher when eye movement compensation was used. In sum, compensating for eye movements facilitated more precise definition of the receptive field. We also monitored horizontal vergence over long sequences of fixation trials and found the variability to be low, as expected for this precise behavior. Our results imply that eye coil signals can be highly accurate and useful for optimizing visual physiology when rigorous precautions are observed.},

The size and spacing of these patches in TE were larger and more irregular than those observed in V1. The labeling intensity of patches in V1 declined sharply with distance from the injection site. This tendency was less obvious in TE; a number of densely labeled patches existed at distant sites beyond weakly labeled patches. While injections into both areas resulted in an elongated pattern of patches, the anisotropy was greater in TE than in V1 for injections of a similar size. Dual tracer injections and larger-sized injections further revealed that the adjacent sites in TE had spatially distinct horizontal projections, compared to those in V1. These area-specific characteristics of the horizontal connections may contribute to the differences in visual information processing of TE and V1.},

V4 was initially characterized as a color-processing area, but subsequent studies revealed that it contains a diverse complement of cells, including those with preference for color, orientation, disparity and higher-order feature preferences. This has led to disputes and uncertainty about the role of V4 in vision. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging methods in awake, behaving monkeys, we found that different feature preferences are functionally organized in V4. Optical images revealed that regions with preferential response to color were largely separate from orientation-selective regions. Our results help to resolve long-standing controversies regarding functional diversity and retinotopy in V4 and indicate the presence of spatially biased distribution of featural representation in V4 in the ventral visual pathway.},

Previously, we showed that, using a strong network inhibition countered by feedforward and recurrent excitation, the cortical model reproduced many observed properties of simple and complex cells. However, that network’s complex cells were poorly selective for orientation, and increasing cortical self-excitation led to network instabilities and unrealistically high firing rates. Here, we show that a sparsity of connections in the network produces large, intrinsic fluctuations in the cortico-cortical conductances that can stabilize the network and that there is a critical level of fluctuations (controllable by sparsity) that allows strong cortical gain and the emergence of orientation-selective complex cells. The resultant sparse network also shows near contrast invariance in its selectivity and, in agreement with recent experiments, has extracellular tuning properties that are similar in pinwheel center and iso-orientation regions, whereas intracellular conductances show positional dependencies. Varying the strength of synaptic fluctuations by adjusting the sparsity of network connectivity, we identified a transition between the dynamics of bistability and without bistability. In a network with strong recurrent excitation, this transition is characterized by a near hysteretic behavior and a rapid rise of network firing rates as the synaptic drive or stimulus input is increased. We discuss the connection between this transition and orientation selectivity in our model of primary visual cortex.},

In particular, the perception of shape depends critically on attention for integrating the various parts of the selected object into a coherent representation of object shape. To study whether oscillatory neuronal synchrony may serve as a mechanism of attention in shape perception, we introduced a novel shape-tracking task requiring sustained attention to a morphing shape. Attention was found to strongly increase oscillatory currents underlying the recorded field potentials in the gamma-frequency range, thus indicating enhanced neuronal synchrony within the population of V4 neurons representing the attended stimulus. Errors indicating a misdirection of attention to the distracter instead of the target were preceded by a corresponding shift of oscillatory activity from the target’s neuronal representation to that of the distracter. No such effect was observed for errors unrelated to attention. Modulations of the attention-dependent enhancement of oscillatory activity occurred in correspondence with changing attentional demands during the course of a trial. The specificity of the effect of attentional errors together with the close coupling between attentional demand and oscillatory activity support the hypothesis that oscillatory neuronal synchrony serves as a mechanism of attention.},

Based on this knowledge, we discovered that electrical microstimulation of V1 in macaque monkeys delays saccadic eye movements when made to visual targets located in the receptive field of the stimulated neurons. This review discusses the following issues. First, the parameters that affect the delay of saccades by microstimulation of V1 are reviewed. Second, the excitability properties of the V1 elements mediating the delay are discussed. Third, the properties that determine the size and shape of the region of visual space affected by stimulation of V1 are described. This region is called a delay field. Fourth, whether the delay effect is mainly due to a disruption of the visual signal transmitted through V1 or whether it is a disturbance of the motor signal transmitted between V1 and the brainstem saccade generator is investigated. Fifth, the properties of delay fields are used to estimate the number of elements activated directly by electrical microstimulation of macaque V1. Sixth, these properties are used to make inferences about the characteristics of visual percepts induced by such stimulation. Seventh, the disruptive effects of V1 stimulation in monkeys and humans are compared. Eighth, a cortical mechanism to account for the disruptive effects of V1 stimulation is proposed. Finally, these effects are related to normal vision.},

abstract = {Several models exist for explaining primary visual cortex (V1) orientation tuning. The modified feedforward model (MFM) and the recurrent model (RM) are major examples. We have implemented these two models, at the same level of detail, alongside a few newer variations, and thoroughly compared their receptive-field structures. We found that antiphase inhibition in the MFM enhances both spatial phase information and orientation tuning, producing well-tuned simple cells. This remains true for a newer version of the MFM that incorporates untuned complex-cell inhibition. In contrast, when the recurrent connections in the RM are strong enough to produce typical V1 orientation tuning, they also eliminate spatial phase information, making the cells complex. Introducing phase specificity into the connections of the RM (as done in an original version of the RM) can make the cells phase sensitive, but the cells show an incorrect 90 degrees peak shift of orientation tuning under opposite contrast signs. An inhibition-dominant version of the RM can generate well-tuned cells across the simple-complex spectrum, but it predicts that the net effect of cortical interactions is to suppress feedforward excitation across all orientations in simple cells. Finally, adding antiphase inhibition used in the MFM into the RM produces a most general model. We call this new model the modified recurrent model (MRM) and show that this model can also produce well-tuned cells throughout the simple-complex spectrum. Unlike the inhibition-dominant RM, the MRM is consistent with data from cat V1, suggesting that the net effect of cortical interactions is to boost simple cell responses at the preferred orientation. These results suggest that the MFM is well suited for explaining orientation tuning in simple cells, whereas the standard RM is for complex cells. The assignment of the RM to complex cells also avoids conflicts between the RM and the experiments of cortical inactivation (done on simple cells) and the spatial-frequency dependency of orientation tuning (found in simple cells). Because orientation-tuned V1 cells show a continuum of simple- to complex-cell behavior, the MRM provides the best description of V1 data.},

Size- or scale-independent representation of visual objects might be supported by processing in primary visual cortex (V1). Neurons in V1 are selective for spatial frequency and thus represent visual information in specific spatial wavebands. We tested whether different receptive field properties of neurons in V1 scale with preferred spatial wavelength. Specifically, we investigated the size of the area that enhances responses, i.e., the grating summation field, the size of the inhibitory surround, and the distance dependence of signal coupling, i.e., the linking field. RESULTS: We found that the sizes of both grating summation field and inhibitory surround increase with preferred spatial wavelength. For the summation field this increase, however, is not strictly linear. No evidence was found that size of the linking field depends on preferred spatial wavelength. CONCLUSIONS: Our data show that some receptive field properties are related to preferred spatial wavelength. This speaks in favor of the hypothesis that processing in V1 supports scale-invariant visual performance. However, not all properties of receptive fields in V1 scale with preferred spatial wavelength. Spatial wavelength independence of the linking field implies constant spatial range of signal coupling between neurons with different spatial wavelengths. This might be important for encoding extended broad-band visual features such as edges.},

abstract = {Thalamic firing synchrony is thought to ensure selective transmission of relevant sensory information to the recipient cortical neurons by rendering them more responsive to temporally correlated input spikes. However, direct evidence for a synchrony code in the thalamus is limited. Here, we directly measure thalamic firing synchrony and its stimulus-induced modulation over time, using simultaneous single unit recordings from individual thalamic barreloids in the rat somatosensory whisker/barrel system. Employing whisker deflections varying in velocity or frequency and a cross-correlation approach, we find systematic changes in both time course and strength of thalamic firing synchrony as a function of stimulus parameters and sensory adaptation. Synchrony develops faster and is greater with higher velocity deflections. Greater firing synchrony reflects stimulus-dependent increases in instantaneous firing rates, greater spike time precision relative to stimulus onset as well as common input that likely arises from divergent trigeminothalamic and corticothalamic neurons. With adaptation, synchrony decreases and takes longer to develop but is more dependent on the cells’ common inputs. Rapid, sharp increases in thalamic synchrony mirroring quick increases in whisker velocity occur also during ongoing random, high-frequency whisker vibrations. Together, results demonstrate millisecond by millisecond changes in thalamic near-synchronous firing during complex patterns of ongoing vibrissa movements that may ensure transmission of preferred sensory information in local thalamocortical circuits during whisking and active touch.},

Hence, neuronal activity correlated with decisions should vary with an area’s position in the cortical hierarchy. To test this proposal, we investigated whether a change in neuronal activity during error trials depends in a systematic way on cortical hierarchical position. While macaque monkeys discriminated the direction of moving visual stimuli, the activity of direction-selective neurons was recorded in four extrastriate visual areas: V3A, the middle temporal area, the middle superior temporal area and the posterior part of the superior temporal polysensory area. Neuronal activity was significantly reduced in all areas when the monkeys made errors in judging the direction of stimuli moving in the preferred direction with low and intermediate luminance contrast. The amount of activity reduction was approximately 50% in all of the visual areas. Thus, the activity on error trials is reduced in early visual processing, independent of the hierarchy in the dorsal visual pathway. The activity reduction depended on stimulus contrast and the direction of the decision relative to the stimulus motion. It was profound and significant in all areas at low stimulus contrast. However, it was nonsignificant at high stimulus contrast. Our data suggest that activity reduction on error trials is due to lack of attention in association with stimulus expectation},

abstract = {The relationship between oxygen levels and neural activity in the brain is fundamental to functional neuroimaging techniques. We have examined this relationship on a fine spatial scale in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and visual cortex of the cat using a microelectrode sensor that provides simultaneous colocalized measurements of oxygen partial pressure in tissue (tissue oxygen) and multiunit neural activity. In previous work with this sensor, we found that changes in tissue oxygen depend strongly on the location and spatial extent of neural activation. Specifically, focal neural activity near the microelectrode elicited decreases in tissue oxygen, whereas spatially extended activation, outside the field of view of our sensor, yielded mainly increases. In the current study, we report an expanded set of measurements to quantify the spatiotemporal relationship between neural responses and changes in tissue oxygen. For the purpose of data analysis, we develop a quantitative model that assumes that changes in tissue oxygen are composed of two response components (one positive and one negative) with magnitudes determined by neural activity on separate spatial scales. Our measurements from visual cortex and the LGN are consistent with this model and suggest that the positive response spreads over a distance of 1-2 mm, whereas the negative component is confined to a few hundred micrometers. These results are directly relevant to the mechanisms that generate functional brain imaging signals and place limits on their spatial properties.},

abstract = {We investigated the saccade decision process by examining activity recorded in the frontal eye field (FEF) of monkeys performing 2 separate visual search experiments in which there were errors in saccade target choice. In the first experiment, the difficulty of a singleton search task was manipulated by varying the similarity between the target and distractors; errors were made more often when the distractors were similar to the target. On catch trials in which the target was absent the monkeys occasionally made false alarm errors by shifting gaze to one of the distractors. The second experiment was a popout color visual search task in which the target and distractor colors switched unpredictably across trials. Errors occurred most frequently on the first trial after the switch and less often on subsequent trials. In both experiments, FEF neurons selected the saccade goal on error trials, not the singleton target of the search array. Although saccades were made to the same stimulus locations, presaccadic activation and the magnitude of selection differed across trial conditions. The variation in presaccadic selective activity was accounted for by the variation in saccade probability across the stimulus-response conditions, but not by variations in saccade metrics. These results suggest that FEF serves as a saccade probability map derived from the combination of bottom-up and top-down influences. Peaks on this map represent the behavioral relevance of each item in the visual field rather than just reflecting saccade preparation. This map in FEF may correspond to the theoretical salience map of many models of attention and saccade target selection.},

A likely source of this attentional bias is the frontal eye field (FEF), an area of the frontal cortex involved in converting visual information into saccade commands. We investigated the link between FEF activity and covert spatial attention by recording from FEF visual and saccade-related neurons in monkeys performing covert visual search tasks without eye movements. Here we show that the source of attention signals in the FEF is enhanced activity of visually responsive neurons. At the time attention is allocated to the visual search target, nonvisually responsive saccade-related movement neurons are inhibited. Therefore, in the FEF, spatial attention signals are independent of explicit saccade command signals. We propose that spatially selective activity in FEF visually responsive neurons corresponds to the mental spotlight of attention via modulation of ongoing visual processing.},

abstract = {1. The latency between the appearance of a popout search display and the eye movement to the oddball target of the display varies from trial to trial in both humans and monkeys. The source of the delay and variability of reaction time is unknown but has been attributed to as yet poorly defined decision processes. 2. We recorded neural activity in the frontal eye field (FEF), an area regarded as playing a central role in producing purposeful eye movements, of monkeys (Macaca mulatta) performing a popout visual search task. Eighty-four neurons with visually evoked activity were analyzed. Twelve of these neurons had a phasic response associated with the presentation of the visual stimulus. The remaining neurons had more tonic responses that persisted through the saccade. Many of the neurons with more tonic responses resembled visuomovement cells in that they had activity that increased before a saccade into their response field. 3. The visual response latencies of FEF neurons were determined with the use of a Poisson spike train analysis. The mean visual latency was 67 ms (minimum = 35 ms, maximum = 138 ms). The visual response latencies to the target presented alone, to the target presented with distractors, or to the distractors did not differ significantly. 4. The initial visual activation of FEF neurons does not discriminate the target from the distractors of a popout visual search stimulus array, but the activity evolves to a state that discriminates whether the target of the search display is within the receptive field. We tested the hypothesis that the source of variability of saccade latency is the time taken by neurons involved in saccade programming to select the target for the gaze shift. 5. With the use of an analysis adapted from signal detection theory, we determined when the activity of single FEF neurons can reliably indicate whether the target or distractors are present within their response fields. The time of target discrimination partitions the reaction time into a perceptual stage in which target discrimination takes place, and a motor stage in which saccade programming and generation take place. The time of target discrimination occurred most often between 120 and 150 ms after stimulus presentation. 6. We analyzed the time course of target discrimination in the activity of single cells after separating trials into short, medium, and long saccade latency groups. Saccade latency was not correlated with the duration of the perceptual stage but was correlated with the duration of the motor stage. This result is inconsistent with the hypothesis that the time taken for target discrimination, as indexed by FEF neurons, accounts for the wide variability in the time of movement initiation. 7. We conclude that the variability observed in saccade latencies during a simple visual search task is largely due to postperceptual motor processing following target discrimination. Signatures of both perceptual and postperceptual processing are evident in FEF. Procrastination in the output stage may prevent stereotypical behavior that would be maladaptive in a changing environment.},

During no-go search trials, the activity of the majority of neurons evolved to signal the location of the oddball stimulus. The degree and time course of the stimulus discrimination process observed in no-go trials was not different from that observed in go trials.

abstract = {Lateral interactions in the outer retina, particularly negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones and direct feed-forward input from horizontal cells to bipolar cells, play a number of important roles in early visual processing, such as generating center-surround receptive fields that enhance spatial discrimination. These circuits may also contribute to post-receptoral light adaptation and the generation of color opponency. In this review, we examine the contributions of horizontal cell feedback and feed-forward pathways to early visual processing. We begin by reviewing the properties of bipolar cell receptive fields, especially with respect to modulation of the bipolar receptive field surround by the ambient light level and to the contribution of horizontal cells to the surround. We then review evidence for and against three proposed mechanisms for negative feedback from horizontal cells to cones: 1) GABA release by horizontal cells, 2) ephaptic modulation of the cone pedicle membrane potential generated by currents flowing through hemigap junctions in horizontal cell dendrites, and 3) modulation of cone calcium currents (I(Ca)) by changes in synaptic cleft proton levels. We also consider evidence for the presence of direct horizontal cell feed-forward input to bipolar cells and discuss a possible role for GABA at this synapse. We summarize proposed functions of horizontal cell feedback and feed-forward pathways. Finally, we examine the mechanisms and functions of two other forms of lateral interaction in the outer retina: negative feedback from horizontal cells to rods and positive feedback from horizontal cells to cones.},

abstract = {When two stimuli are present in the receptive field of a V4 neuron, the firing rate response is between the weakest and strongest response elicited by each of the stimuli when presented alone (Reynolds, Chelazzi, & Desimone, 1999). When attention is directed toward the stimulus eliciting the strongest response (the preferred stimulus), the response to the pair is increased, whereas the response decreases when attention is directed to the other stimulus (the poor stimulus). When attention is directed to either of the two stimuli presented alone, the firing rate remains the same or increases slightly, but the coherence between the neuron’s spike train and the local field potential can increase (Fries, Reynolds, Rorie, & Desimone, 2001). These experimental results were reproduced in a model of a V4 neuron under the assumption that attention modulates the activity of local interneuron networks. The V4 model neuron received stimulus-specific excitation from V2 and synchronous inhibitory inputs from two local interneuron networks in V4. Each interneuron network was driven by stimulus-specific excitatory inputs from V2 and was modulated by the activity of the frontal eye fields. Stimulus competition was present because of a delay in arrival time of synchronous volleys from each interneuron network. For small delays, the firing rate was close to the rate elicited by the preferred stimulus alone, whereas for larger delays, it approached the firing rate of the poor stimulus. When either stimulus was presented alone, the neuron’s response was not altered by the change in delay, but could change due to modulation of the degree of synchrony of the corresponding interneuron network. The model suggests that top-down attention biases the competition between V2 columns for control of V4 neurons primarily by changing the relative timing of inhibition, whereas changes in the degree of synchrony of interneuron networks modulate the response to a single stimulus. The new mechanism proposed here for attentional modulation of firing rate, gain modulation by inhibitory interference, is likely to have more general applicability to cortical information processing.},

abstract = {The synchrony of neurons in extrastriate visual cortex is modulated by selective attention even when there are only small changes in firing rate (Fries, Reynolds, Rorie, & Desimone, 2001). We used Hodgkin-Huxley type models of cortical neurons to investigate the mechanism by which the degree of synchrony can be modulated independently of changes in firing rates. The synchrony of local networks of model cortical interneurons interacting through GABA(A) synapses was modulated on a fast timescale by selectively activating a fraction of the interneurons. The activated interneurons became rapidly synchronized and suppressed the activity of the other neurons in the network but only if the network was in a restricted range of balanced synaptic background activity. During stronger background activity, the network did not synchronize, and for weaker background activity, the network synchronized but did not return to an asynchronous state after synchronizing. The inhibitory output of the network blocked the activity of pyramidal neurons during asynchronous network activity, and during synchronous network activity, it enhanced the impact of the stimulus-related activity of pyramidal cells on receiving cortical areas (Salinas & Sejnowski, 2001). Synchrony by competition provides a mechanism for controlling synchrony with minor alterations in rate, which could be useful for information processing. Because traditional methods such as cross-correlation and the spike field coherence require several hundred milliseconds of recordings and cannot measure rapid changes in the degree of synchrony, we introduced a new method to detect rapid changes in the degree of coincidence and precision of spike timing.},

abstract = {Neuronal synchronization can be defined as a correlated appearance in time of two or more events associated with various aspects of neuronal activity. Neuronal synchronization depends on chemical and electrical synaptic as well as ephaptic and non-specific interactions. We consider two distinct types of neuronal synchronization: local synchronization that is responsible for the generation of local field potentials; and long-range synchronization, detected with distantly located electrodes and mediated primarily via chemical synaptic interactions, which contributes to the EEG synchronization. Neocortical synchronization during sleep and wakefulness is often associated with rhythmic oscillations of neuronal activity: slow oscillation, delta, spindle, beta, gamma and ripples. Normal thalamocortical oscillations [sleep or wake oscillations] are generated as a result of both local and long-range synchronization. During paroxysmal [seizure] activity, the role of chemical synaptic interactions decreases because of alterations in ionic composition that impairs synaptic transmission. Synchronized activities in large population of neurons (such as neocortex) may occur as nearly simultaneous patterns across an entire population or as propagating waves. Neocortical synchronization is controlled by the activities in ascending systems: cholinergic, norepinephrinergic and serotoninergic. The presence of cortico-thalamo-cortical feedback loops contribute to the synchronization of cortical activities. We propose that all the types of neuronal interactions contribute to the generation of synchronous oscillatory activities, but the ratio of their contribution is different for different types of oscillations.},

In isolated cortical slabs (10 mm long, 6 mm wide and 4-5 mm deep), augmenting responses to pulse-trains at 10 Hz (responses with growing amplitudes from the second stimulus in a train) were elicited only by relatively high-intensity stimuli. At low intensities, responses were decremental. The largest augmenting responses were evoked in neurones located close to the stimulation site. Quantitative analyses of the number of action potentials and the amplitude and area of depolarization during augmenting responses in a population of neurones recorded from slabs showed that the most dramatic increases in the number of spikes with successive stimuli, and the greatest increase in depolarization amplitude, were found in conventional fast-spiking (FS) neurones. The largest increase in the area of depolarization was found in regular-spiking (RS) neurones. Dual intracellular recordings from a pair of FS and RS neurones in the slab revealed more action potentials in the FS neurone during augmenting responses and a significant increase in the depolarization area of the RS neurone that was dependent on the firing of the FS neurone. Self-sustained seizures could occur in the slab after rhythmic stimuli at 10 Hz. In the intact cortex, repeated sequences of stimuli generating augmenting responses or spontaneous spindles could induce an increased synaptic responsiveness to single stimuli, which lasted for several minutes. A similar time course of increased responsiveness was obtained with induction of cellular plasticity. These data suggest that augmenting responses elicited by stimulation, as well as spontaneously occurring spindles, may induce short- and medium-term plasticity of neuronal responses Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

However, the cellular and network level effects of stimulation are still unclear and their study relies heavily on indirect physiological measurements in humans. Direct electrophysiological studies of the effect of magnetic stimulation on neuronal activity in behaving animals are severely limited by both the size of the stimulating coils, which affect large regions of the animal brain, and the large artifacts generated on the recording electrodes. We present a novel mini-coil which is specifically aimed at studying the neurophysiological mechanism of magnetic stimulation in behaving primates. The mini-coil fits into a chronic recording chamber and provides focal activation of brain areas while enabling simultaneous extracellular multi-electrode recordings. We present a comparison of this coil to a commercial coil based on the theoretical and recorded magnetic fields and induced electric fields they generate. Subsequently, we present the signal recorded in the behaving primate during stimulation and demonstrate the ability to extract the spike trains of multiple single units from each of the electrodes with minimal periods affected by the stimulus artifact (median period <2.5 ms). The directly recorded effect of the magnetic stimulation on cortical neurons is in line with peripheral recordings obtained in humans. This novel mini-coil is a key part of the infrastructure for studying the neurophysiological basis of magnetic stimulation, thereby enabling the development and testing of better magnetic stimulation tools and protocols for both neuroscientists and clinicians.},

abstract = {The science of consciousness has made great strides by focusing on the behavioural and neuronal correlates of experience. However, while such correlates are important for progress to occur, they are not enough if we are to understand even basic facts, for example, why the cerebral cortex gives rise to consciousness but the cerebellum does not, though it has even more neurons and appears to be just as complicated. Moreover, correlates are of little help in many instances where we would like to know if consciousness is present: patients with a few remaining islands of functioning cortex, preterm infants, non-mammalian species and machines that are rapidly outperforming people at driving, recognizing faces and objects, and answering difficult questions. To address these issues, we need not only more data but also a theory of consciousness—one that says what experience is and what type of physical systems can have it. Integrated information theory (IIT) does so by starting from experience itself via five phenomenological axioms: intrinsic existence, composition, information, integration and exclusion. From these it derives five postulates about the properties required of physical mechanisms to support consciousness. The theory provides a principled account of both the quantity and the quality of an individual experience (a quale), and a calculus to evaluate whether or not a particular physical system is conscious and of what. Moreover, IIT can explain a range of clinical and laboratory findings, makes a number of testable predictions and extrapolates to a number of problematic conditions. The theory holds that consciousness is a fundamental property possessed by physical systems having specific causal properties. It predicts that consciousness is graded, is common among biological organisms and can occur in some very simple systems. Conversely, it predicts that feed-forward networks, even complex ones, are not conscious, nor are aggregates such as groups of individuals or heaps of sand. Also, in sharp contrast to widespread functionalist beliefs, IIT implies that digital computers, even if their behaviour were to be functionally equivalent to ours, and even if they were to run faithful simulations of the human brain, would experience next to nothing.},

Here we tested these two hypotheses in macaque visual cortex, where ‘V4’ was originally defined, and first described as color selective. Activity produced by equiluminant color-varying (versus luminance-varying) gratings was measured using double-label deoxyglucose in awake fixating macaques, in multiple areas of flattened visual cortex. Much of cortex was activated near-equally by both color- and luminance-varying stimuli. In remaining cortical regions, discrete color-biased columns were found in many cortical visual areas, whereas luminance-biased activity was found in only a few specific regions (V1 layer 4B and area MT). Consistent with a recent hypothesis, V4 was not uniquely specialized for color processing, but areas located antero-ventral to V4 (in/near TEO and anterior TE) showed more color-biased activity.},

We recorded neural activity in the FEF of monkeys trained to manually turn a lever towards the location of a pop-out target of a visual search array without shifting gaze. We examined whether the reliability of the neural representation of the salient target location predicted the monkeys’ accuracy of reporting target location. We found that FEF neurons reliably encoded the location of the target stimulus not only on correct trials but also on error trials. The representation of target location in FEF persisted until the manual behavioral report but did not increase in magnitude. This result suggests that, in the absence of an eye movement report, FEF encodes the perceptual information necessary to perform the task but does not accumulate this sensory evidence towards a perceptual decision threshold. These results provide physiological evidence that, under certain circumstances, accurate perceptual representations do not always lead to accurate behavioral reports and that variability in processes outside of perception must be considered to account for the variability in perceptual choice behavior.},

abstract = {We present detailed passive cable models of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells based on somatic voltage transients in response to brief current pulses at physiological and room temperatures and demonstrate how cooling alters the shape of postsynaptic responses. Whole cell recordings were made from cells in visual cortical slices from 20- to 22-day-old rats. The cells were filled with biocytin and morphologies were reconstructed from three cells which were representative of the full range of physiological responses. These formed the basis for electrotonic models with four electrical variables, namely membrane capacitance (Cm), membrane resistivity (Rm), cytoplasmic resistivity (Ri) and a somatic shunt conductance (Gsh). Simpler models, with a single value for Rm and no Gsh, did not fit the data adequately. Optimal parameter values were derived by simulating the responses to somatic current pulses, varying the parameters to give the best match to the experimental recordings. Gsh and Rm were badly constrained. In contrast, the total membrane conductance (Gtot) was well constrained, and its reciprocal correlated closely with the slowest membrane time constant (τ0). The models showed close agreement for Cm and Ri (ranges at 36 °C: 0.78–0.94 μF cm−2 and 140–170 Ωcm), but a larger range for Gtot (7.2–18.4 nS). Cooling produced consistent effects in all three model cells; Cm remained constant (Q10 = 0.96), Ri increased (Q10 = 0.80), whilst Gtot dropped (Q10 = 1.98). In terms of whole cell physiology, the predominant effect of cooling is to dramatically lengthen the decay of transient voltage shifts. Simulations suggest that this markedly increases the temporal summation of postsynaptic potentials and we demonstrate this effect in the responses of layer 2/3 cells to tetanic extracellular stimulation in layer 4.},

abstract = {We estimated the sensitivity for detecting a row of collinear target elements (usually dots) by measuring the maximum density of randomly positioned noise elements that allowed 75% correct detection of the orientation of alignment (binary choice: horizontal versus vertical) of the target elements. We varied the number of target elements, their mode of generation, and their accuracy of positioning. As reported previously (Moulden (1994) Higher-order processing in the visual system. Ciba Foundation Symposium 184. Chichester: Wiley), target detection improved rapidly until the number of target elements reached about seven, and then improved more slowly beyond this point. However, this break was reduced (and often removed entirely) when the target array was formed by repositioning pre-existing noise elements lying close to the target location, rather than by superimposition of additional target elements onto the noise array. This almost linear slope of improvement, coupled with the observation that target detection was disrupted more by random jitter of target elements at right angles to their axis of alignment than by jittering along this axis, argues against a two-stage process of perceptual grouping (Moulden, 1994) and supports instead an explanation based on the operation of a single mechanism. This single mechanism explanation is further supported by the observation that intrinsic positional uncertainty (estimated from the results of jitter experiments) was independent of target element number. Additional experiments showed that target detection is facilitated by aperiodic noise dots that fall close to the target axis. The results are discussed in relation to alternative explanations of perceptual grouping.},

abstract = {Fine temporal patterns of firing in much of the brain are highly irregular. In some circuits, the precise pattern of irregularity contains information beyond that contained in mean firing rates. However, the capacity of neural circuits to use this additional information for computational purposes is not well understood. Here we employ computational methods to show that an ensemble of neurons firing at a constant mean rate can induce arbitrarily chosen temporal current patterns in postsynaptic cells. If the presynaptic neurons fire with nearly uniform interspike intervals, then current patterns are sensitive to variations in spike timing. But irregular, Poisson-like firing can drive current patterns robustly, even if spike timing varies by tens of milliseconds from trial to trial. Notably, irregular firing patterns can drive useful patterns of current even if they are so variable that several hundred repeated experimental trials would be needed to distinguish them from random firing. Together, these results describe an unrestrictive set of conditions in which postsynaptic cells might exploit virtually any information contained in spike timing. We speculate as to how this capability may underlie an extension of population coding to the temporal domain.},

abstract = {In primary visual cortex (V1), neuronal responses are sensitive to context. For example, responses to stimuli presented within the receptive field (RF) center are often suppressed by stimuli within the RF surround, and this suppression tends to be strongest when the center and surround stimuli match. We sought to identify the mechanism that gives rise to these properties of surround modulation. To do so, we exploited the stability of implanted multielectrode arrays to record from neurons in V1 of alert monkeys with multiple stimulus sets that more exhaustively probed center-surround interactions. We first replicated previous results concerning center-surround similarity using gratings representing all combinations of center and surround orientation. With this stimulus set, the surround simply scaled population responses to the center, such that the overall population tuning curve had the same shape and peak response. However, when the center contained two superimposed gratings (i.e., a visual “plaid”), one component of which always matched the surround orientation, suppression selectively affected the portion of the response driven by the matching center component, thereby producing shifts in the peak of the population orientation tuning curve. In effect, the surround caused neurons to respond predominantly to the component grating of the center plaid that was unmatched to the surround grating, as if by reducing the effective strength of whichever stimulus attributes were matched to the surround. These results provide key physiological support for theoretical models that propose feature-specific, input-gain control as the mechanism underlying surround suppression.},

In response to a drifting grating, the linear term represents the temporal modulation of input, and the nonlinear term represents the mean input. The nonlinear term, which grows with stimulus contrast, has been neglected in many previous models of simple cell response. We then analyze two scenarios by which contrast-invariance of orientation tuning may arise. In the first scenario, at larger contrasts, the nonlinear part of the LGN input, in combination with strong push-pull inhibition, counteracts the nonlinear effects of cortical spike threshold, giving the result that orientation tuning scales with contrast. In the second scenario, at low contrasts, the nonlinear component of LGN input is negligible, and noise smooths the nonlinearity of spike threshold so that the input-output function approximates a power-law function. These scenarios can be combined to yield contrast-invariant tuning over the full range of stimulus contrast. The model clarifies the contribution of LGN nonlinearities to the orientation tuning of simple cells and demonstrates how these nonlinearities may impact different models of contrast-invariant tuning},

We studied the functional organization of color opponency in the blob regions of the parafoveal representation of the visual cortex. We also examined the patterns of connectivity among blob and nonblob cells by multiple electrode penetrations and cross-correlation analysis. Some of the color-selective cells in the blobs exhibited receptive fields that were similar to those found in the parvocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN): one type exhibited center-surround spatial and chromatic opponency corresponding to the Type I cell found in the LGN; another had center-only chromatic opponency, corresponding to the Type II cell of the LGN. A blob color-selective cell with no LGN counterpart had center color opponency with a nonchromatically opponent surround antagonism. We termed this cell the “modified Type II” cell. Contrary to previous reports, few true double color-opponent cells were found. Some blob cells previously characterized as double opponent probably belong to our modified Type II category and, unlike true double opponent cells, do not respond well to isoluminant color boundaries. Occasional color-selective oriented cells were either intermixed or in close proximity to blob cells. Neighboring electrode penetrations within the same blob yielded cells of the same color opponency, either red versus green or blue versus yellow, suggesting that individual blobs are dedicated to processing one color opponency. Blobs dedicated to red/green color opponency were 3 times more numerous than blue/yellow blobs. Furthermore, the cells in layer 4C lying beneath blobs of a given color opponency had identical color opponency to the overlying cells in blobs. Cross-correlation analysis of pairs of nonblob, oriented cells in the superficial layers showed interactions between cells with matched orientation and eye preference, at varying horizontal separations. Such interactions are consistent with anatomically demonstrated clustered horizontal connections. Positive cross-correlograms were found between blob cells in the same and in adjacent blobs when the cells’ receptive field type, color opponency, and ocular dominance matched. Correlograms also indicated monosynaptic connections from Type II to modified Type II cells of the same color opponency, suggesting that Type II cells may contribute to the construction of the modified Type II fields in the cortex.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

To visualize the disparity selective regions of V2, the imaging of binocular interaction was employed. These imaging maps guided single unit penetrations that then revealed a columnar organization for disparity. Our studies also showed a pattern of intermixing between the color and disparity pathways of V2, including the existence of single cells tuned for both color and disparity. While previous studies have suggested that the CO stripes of V2 constitute the fundamental organizational unit within V2, our results show a further level of organization consisting of functionally distinct subcompartments, 0.7-1.5 mm in diameter, within individual stripes. These subcompartments, which are not clearly revealed by CO histochemistry, lie within each of the thin, pale, and thick CO dense stripes in V2 and are specific for aspects of color, orientation and retinal disparity, respectively. The present results favor an architectural view of V2, not unlike that of V1, as a collection of functionally distinct subcompartments or modules situated within each of the V2 stripes. These modules also support the notion that for each cortical area (e.g. V1, V2, V4), there exists a stereotyped cortical module with a geometry that is characteristic for each area. These modules exist as a middle tier in a hierarchy of functional organization within V2.},

We used cross-correlation analysis in cat striate cortex to detect interactions between cells over comparable distances. Using one cell as a reference, we recorded from other cells with a second electrode at varying distances and looked for correlated firing between the two recording sites. This technique allowed us to combine a physiological measure of the strength and type of connection between cells with a characterization of their receptive field properties. The observed interactions were excitatory, and extended over horizontal distances of several millimeters. Furthermore, the interactions were between orientation columns of like specificity, resulting in a waxing and waning in the strength of interaction as the electrodes passed through different orientation columns. We studied relationships between strength of correlation and other receptive field properties and found a tendency for facilitatory interactions between cells sharing the same eye preference. A large proportion of our correlations was due to common input. This feature, and the similarity of interactions between cells in the same column with the reference cell, suggest a high degree of interconnectivity between and within the columns. As the distance between the two electrodes increased, the overlap of the receptive fields of the cells participating in the interactions gradually diminished. At the furthest distances recorded, the cell pairs had nonoverlapping receptive fields separated by several degrees. The distribution and range of these interactions corresponded to the clustering and extent of the horizontal connections observed anatomically.},

New traces, trained for only one trial, then became assimilated and rapidly hippocampal-independent. Schemas also played a causal role in the creation of lasting associative memory representations during one-trial learning.

In motion standstill, a pattern that is moving quite rapidly is perceived as being motionless, and yet its details are not blurred but clearly visible. We revisited motion standstill in dynamic random-dot stereograms similar to those first used by Julesz and Payne [Julesz B, Payne R (1968) Vision Res 8:433-444]. Three improvements were made to their paradigm to avoid possible confounds: The temporal frequency of the motion stimuli was manipulated independently from that of individual stereo gratings so that the failure of motion perception is not due to inability to compute stereo. The motion of the stereo gratings was continuous across the visual field so that the perceived pattern in motion standstill was not a simple average of a back-and-forth display wobble over time. Observers discriminated three spatial frequencies to demonstrate pattern recognition. Three objective psychophysical methods, instead of merely self-report, were used to objectively demonstrate motion standstill. Our results confirm that motion standstill occurs in dynamic random-dot stereogram motion displays at 4-6 Hz. Motion standstill occurs when the stimulus spatiotemporal frequency combination exceeds that of the salience-based third-order motion system in a spatiotemporal frequency range in which the shape and depth systems still function. The ability of shape systems to extract a representative image from a series of moving samples is a significant component of a biological system’s ability to derive a stable perceptual world from a constantly changing visual environment.},

Here we report on a powerful variant of existing techniques, continuous flash suppression. Distinct images flashed successively at 10 Hz into one eye reliably suppress an image presented to the other eye. The duration of perceptual suppression is at least ten times greater than that produced by binocular rivalry. Using this tool we show that the strength of the negative afterimage of an adaptor was reduced by half when it was perceptually suppressed by input from the other eye. The more completely the adaptor was suppressed, the more strongly the afterimage intensity was reduced. Paradoxically, trial-to-trial visibility of the adaptor did not correlate with the degree of reduction. Our results imply that formation of afterimages involves neuronal structures that access input from both eyes but that do not correspond directly to the neuronal correlates of perceptual awareness.},

abstract = {Neurons in the primate extrastriate cortex are highly selective for complex stimulus features such as faces, objects, and motion patterns. One explanation for this selectivity is that neurons in these areas carry out sophisticated computations on the outputs of lower-level areas such as primary visual cortex (V1), where neuronal selectivity is often modeled in terms of linear spatiotemporal filters. However, it has long been known that such simple V1 models are incomplete because they fail to capture important nonlinearities that can substantially alter neuronal selectivity for specific stimulus features. Thus a key step in understanding the function of higher cortical areas is the development of realistic models of their V1 inputs. We have addressed this issue by constructing a computational model of the V1 neurons that provide the strongest input to extrastriate cortical middle temporal (MT) area. We find that a modest elaboration to the standard model of V1 direction selectivity generates model neurons with strong end-stopping, a property that is also found in the V1 layers that provide input to MT. With this computational feature in place, the seemingly complex properties of MT neurons can be simulated by assuming that they perform a simple nonlinear summation of their inputs. The resulting model, which has a very small number of free parameters, can simulate many of the diverse properties of MT neurons. In particular, we simulate the invariance of MT tuning curves to the orientation and length of tilted bar stimuli, as well as the accompanying temporal dynamics. We also show how this property relates to the continuum from component to pattern selectivity observed when MT neurons are tested with plaids. Finally, we confirm several key predictions of the model by recording from MT neurons in the alert macaque monkey. Overall our results demonstrate that many of the seemingly complex computations carried out by high-level cortical neurons can in principle be understood by examining the properties of their inputs.},

abstract = {Intracellular recordings were made from thalamocortical neurons in slices of rat dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus in vitro, where ionotropic glutamate receptors and ionotropic and metabotropic GABA receptors had been blocked. The activation of specific metabotropic glutamate receptors by exogenous agonists and by the electrical stimulation of the corticothalamic pathway was then assessed using selective antagonists. The specific group I agonist (S)-3, 5-dihydoxyphenylglycine and the non-selective agonist (1S, 3R)-1-aminocyclo-pentane-1,3-dicarboxylic acid both caused a concentration-dependent depolarization of membrane potential. These effects were associated with an increase in the apparent input resistance, and a more robust expression of both the depolarizing sag of the voltage response and the low-threshold Ca(2+) potential and an increase in thalamocortical neuron excitability. However, group I agonists selective for the mGlu5 receptor and agonists selective for group II and III receptors did not have these effects. Consequently, these data suggested that these actions were mediated specifically by the group I mGlu1 receptor. The activation of cortical fibres, with trains of 50 stimuli at 50Hz, resulted in a two-component depolarizing response. The first part of this synaptic response and the agonist-induced depolarization of membrane potential were depressed by the novel group I receptor antagonists LY367366 and LY367385, which are active at mGlu1 receptors. However, they were not blocked by 6-methyl-2-(phenylethyl)-pyridine, a highly selective mGlu5 receptor antagonist.Thus, the membrane potential depolarization of thalamocortical neurons caused either by exogenous agonists or by the stimulation of cortical fibres resulted from the specific activation of mGlu1 but not mGlu5 receptors. This result is consistent with the location of this receptor type on the distal dendrites of thalamocortical neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus of the thalamus.},

abstract = {The local synaptic connectivity in the superficial gray layer of the superior colliculus (SC) was assessed following retinal ganglion cell axonal regeneration through a peripheral nerve graft into the SC of Lister Hooded rats, using in vitro brain slice techniques. Repair was effected between the ipsilateral eye and SC, following bilateral lesion of optic nerves and ablation of ipsilateral occipital cortex. Deafferentation surgery alone resulted in a complete loss of synaptic potentials of extrinsic origin, once both retinal and cortical inputs were removed. Stimulation of graft insertion sites elicited synaptic responses comprising monosynaptic and network-mediated depolarising events. This activity, together with similar spontaneous bursts of depolarising events and action potential firing, was generated by the activation of non-N-methyl-D-aspartate glutamate receptors. This behaviour may reflect the development of a local recurrent synaptic connectivity following the repair surgery, as both evoked and spontaneous responses developed into large long-lasting bursts of excitatory activity when inhibition mediated by GABA receptors was blocked. These results suggest that the ultrastructural changes in the superficial layers of the SC resulting from deafferentation are reflected functionally at the synaptic level in the target structure even after repair. Such changes are likely to compromise the ability of the target structure to function normally during information processing. Therefore, although axons regenerating along peripheral nerve grafts can make functional synaptic connections, their efficacy in activating the target structure will probably be compromised by local changes in synaptic connectivity.},

Within the lateral geniculate nucleus, the ascending visual signals are modified by the actions of a number of afferent pathways. One such projection originates in the pretectum and appears to be active in association with oculomotor activity. Much remains unknown about the pretectal-geniculate projection. Our purpose was to examine for the first time individual axon arbors from the pretectum that project to the lateral geniculate nucleus, describing their topography and nuclear and laminar targets. We made injections of the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin into the cat pretectum, targeting the nucleus of the optic tract. Serial 40 microns coronal sections were processed by using immunohistochemistry to reveal labeled axons that were then serially reconstructed using light microscopy. Pretectal-geniculate axons appeared morphologically heterogeneous in terms of swelling size, branching patterns, and laminar target. Most axons innervated the geniculate A laminae. A separate, smaller population innervated the C laminae. All axons exhibited substantially greater spread medial-laterally than rostral-caudally in the lateral geniculate nucleus, displaying a topographical organization for visual field elevation, but not azimuth. Many pretectal axons that projected to the LGN also innervated adjacent structures, including the medial interlaminar nucleus, the perigeniculate nucleus, and/or the pulvinar. These results indicate that the projection from the pretectum to the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus is heterogeneous, is semitopographical, and may coordinate neural activity in the lateral geniculate nucleus and in neighboring visual thalamic structures in association with oculomotor events.},

The purpose of this study was to investigate laminar and cellular targets of individual thalamic reticular nucleus axons in the highly laminated lateral geniculate nucleus of the prosimian primate Galago to better understand the nature and function of this projection. Thalamic reticular axons labeled anterogradely by means of biotinylated dextran amine were examined by using light microscopic serial reconstruction and electron microscopic analysis in combination with postembedding immunohistochemical labeling for the neurotransmitter gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). The synaptic targets of labeled reticular terminal profiles were primarily GABA-negative dendrites (79-84%) of thalamocortical cells, whereas up to 16% were GABA-positive dendritic shafts or F2 terminals of interneurons. Reconstructed thalamic reticular nucleus axons were narrowly aligned along a single axis perpendicular to the geniculate laminar plane, exhibiting a high degree of visuotopic precision. Individual reticular axons targeted multiple or all geniculate laminae, with little laminar selectivity in the distribution of swellings with regard to the eye of origin or to the parvocellular, koniocellular, or magnocellular type neurons contained in the separate layers of the Galago lateral geniculate nucleus. These results suggest that cells in the visual thalamic reticular nucleus influence the lateral geniculate nucleus retinotopically, with little regard to visual functional streams. J. Comp.

abstract = {The visual pathway from retina through the lateral geniculate nucleus to visual cortex in the cat is comprised of several parallel neuronal streams that independently analyze different aspects of the visual scene. The best known of these are the X and Y pathways that relay through the geniculate A laminae. Recent receptive-field studies of retinal and geniculate neurons suggest that there is a further elaboration of cell types at the level of the lateral geniculate nucleus. That is, two types of geniculate X cells with different temporal patterns of responses to visual stimuli are recognized, one with “nonlagged” features, exhibiting shorter response latencies and another with “lagged” features; all retinal X cells are nonlagged. We asked whether nonlagged and lagged responses represent different cell classes or two response modes of the same cells, perhaps under the control of nonretinal afferents to these relay cells. Accordingly, we studied the effects on appropriate receptive-field properties of electrical activation of the midbrain parabrachial region, which is a major nonretinal input to relay cells. Such parabrachial stimulation made each of the eight lagged X cells much more like nonlagged cells, and this stimulation completely transformed the lagged response profiles of six of the eight cells to nonlagged. We thus conclude that the property of lagged responsiveness, which is an emergent property of the lateral geniculate nucleus, is a different response mode of the same cells that can also display nonlagged responses, rather than representing different cell classes; furthermore, this switching between response modes is, at least partly, under the control of afferents from the parabrachial region.},

abstract = {1. The lateral geniculate nucleus is the primary thalamic relay through which retinal signals pass en route to cortex. This relay is gated and can be suppressed by activity among local inhibitory neurons that use gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) as a neurotransmitter. In the cat, a major source of this GABAergic inhibition seems to arise from cells of the perigeniculate nucleus, which lies just dorsal to the A-laminae of the lateral geniculate nucleus. However, the morphological characteristics of perigeniculate cells, and particularly the projection patterns of their axons, have never been fully characterized. We thus examined the morphology of these cells: individually by intracellular injection of horseradish peroxidase (HRP) and en masse with the anterograde tracer Phaseolus vulgaris leucoagglutinin (PHAL). 2. We recorded from 12 perigeniculate cells that we impaled and successfully labeled with HRP. These cells exhibited response properties generally consistent with those described previously. They had long response latencies to stimulation of the optic chiasm and relatively large, often diffuse, receptive fields. The visually evoked responses of most of the cells were dominated by one eye. Compared with cells of the lateral geniculate nucleus, perigeniculate cells had large somata (517 +/- 136 microns 2 in cross-sectional area, mean +/- SD), which were fusiform or multipolar in shape, and dendritic arbors that extended a considerable distance (1,095 +/- 167 microns) parallel to the border between the perigeniculate and lateral geniculate nuclei. Terminal arbors of some dendrites were quite complex and beaded. 3. The axons of six perigeniculate cells were labeled sufficiently well to trace and reconstruct over a considerable distance. Each of these axons formed branches that descended to innervate the lateral geniculate nucleus, and this geniculate innervation was exclusively limited to the A-laminae. Terminal boutons within the A-laminae were nearly all en passant, which gave the axons a beaded appearance. Furthermore, branches of five of these six axons provided local innervation of the perigeniculate nucleus, generally within each labeled cell’s own dendritic arbor. Three of the cells also exhibited an axon branch that extended medially and caudally away from the soma, but we were unable to trace these axon branches to their targets. 4. Within the lateral geniculate nucleus, each arbor of perigeniculate axons derived from two main components. One was a narrow, sparse medial component that innervated laminae A and A1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

Recently, neural network models of visual object recognition, including biological and deep network models, have shown remarkable progress and have begun to rival human performance in some challenging tasks. These models are trained on image examples and learn to extract features and representations and to use them for categorization. It remains unclear, however, whether the representations and learning processes discovered by current models are similar to those used by the human visual system. Here we show, by introducing and using minimal recognizable images, that the human visual system uses features and processes that are not used by current models and that are critical for recognition. We found by psychophysical studies that at the level of minimal recognizable images a minute change in the image can have a drastic effect on recognition, thus identifying features that are critical for the task. Simulations then showed that current models cannot explain this sensitivity to precise feature configurations and, more generally, do not learn to recognize minimal images at a human level. The role of the features shown here is revealed uniquely at the minimal level, where the contribution of each feature is essential. A full understanding of the learning and use of such features will extend our understanding of visual recognition and its cortical mechanisms and will enhance the capacity of computational models to learn from visual experience and to deal with recognition and detailed image interpretation.},

Our results indicated that all parts of V4 are connected with occipital areas V2 (visual area 2), V3 (visual area 3), and V3A (visual complex V3, part A), superior temporal areas V4t (V4 transition zone), MT (medial temporal area), and FST (fundus of the superior temporal sulcus [STS] area), inferior temporal areas TEO (cytoarchitectonic area TEO in posterior inferior temporal cortex) and TE (cytoarchitectonic area TE in anterior temporal cortex), and the frontal eye field (FEF). By contrast, mainly peripheral field representations of V4 are connected with occipitoparietal areas DP (dorsal prelunate area), VIP (ventral intraparietal area), LIP (lateral intraparietal area), PIP (posterior intraparietal area), parieto-occipital area, and MST (medial STS area), and parahippocampal area TF (cytoarchitectonic area TF on the parahippocampal gyrus). Based on the distribution of labeled cells and terminals, projections from V4 to V2 and V3 are feedback, those to V3A, V4t, MT, DP, VIP, PIP, and FEF are the intermediate type, and those to FST, MST, LIP, TEO, TE, and TF are feedforward. Peripheral field projections from V4 to parietal areas could provide a direct route for rapid activation of circuits serving spatial vision and spatial attention. By contrast, the predominance of central field projections from V4 to inferior temporal areas is consistent with the need for detailed form analysis for object vision.},

abstract = {When a stimulus repeatedly and rapidly changes color (e.g., between red and green) and motion direction (e.g., upwards and downwards) with the same frequency, it was found that observers were most ikely to pair colors and motion directions when the direction changes lead the color changes by approximately 80 ms. This is the color–motion asynchrony illusion. According to the differential processing time model, the illusion is explained because the neural activity leading to the perceptual experience of motion requires more time than that of color. Alternatively, the time marker model attributes the misbinding to a failure in matching different sorts of changes at rapid alternations. Here, running counter to the time marker model, we demonstrate that the illusion can arise with a single direction change. Using this simplified version of the illusion we also show that, although some form of visual masking takes place between colors, the measured asynchrony genuinely reflects processing time differences.},

These findings challenge the classical interpretation of human evoked potential (EP) data that assume that the first, “exogenous”, EP components from 50 to 150 ms reflect the initial volley of sensory activation in the striate and extrastriate visual cortex and are not yet influenced by cognitive task demands. Indeed, several recent EP studies using analysis methods that go beyond the classical approach of defining “components” at certain scalp positions indicate that highly complex stimulus features can influence EP responses within the first 100 ms. This indicates that sophisticated cognitive processing is much faster than previously thought and opens new perspectives with respect to the role of both, bottom-up as well as top-down mechanisms in visual processing},

In contrast, adjacent sections stained with the Fink-Heimer method showed fine dust like degeneration throughout all of the laminae of the nucleus. Comparisons of Fink-Heimer degeneration resulting from lesions of area 17 with that resulting from lesions of areas 18 and 19 further suggested that the area) projection is heavier and more uniform than the projections from areas 18 and 19. Autoradiographic tracing of axons after intracortical injections of 3H-proline provided detailed demonstrations of the cortical projection patterns that confirmed the Fink-Heimer results. Following restricted injections of areas 17 or 18 the termination zones in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus consisted of columns of labeled tissue oriented perpendicular to the laminae of the nucleus. Area 17 was found to project heavily and uniformly throughout all of the laminae of the nucleus. The projection from area 18 also extended throughout all of the laminae of the nucleus, but was sparser and less uniformly distributed than that from area 17. Projections from area 18 distributed more heavily to the interlaminar zones and to lamina C than to laminae A, A1 C1, C2 or C3. A projection from area 19 to laminae C1, C2 and C3 was also demonstrated autoradiographically.},

When several objects are present simultaneously in the visual field, a mechanism is required to group (bind) together visual features that belong to each object and to separate (segment) them from features of other objects. An attractive scheme for binding visual features into a coherent percept consists of synchronizing the activity of their neural representations3,4,5,6. If synchrony is important in binding, one would expect that binding and segmentation are facilitated by visual displays that are temporally manipulated to induce stimulus-dependent synchrony. Here we show that visual grouping is indeed facilitated when elements of one percept are presented at the same time as each other and are temporally separated (on a scale below the integration time of the visual system7) from elements of another percept or from background elements. Our results indicate that binding is due to a global mechanism of grouping caused by synchronous neural activation, and not to a local mechanism of motion computation},

In the present study, experiments were performed in the cat that examined the specificity and strength of monosynaptic connections between retinal ganglion cells and their target neurons. The responses of 205 pairs of retinal ganglion cells and geniculate neurons with overlapping receptive-field centers or surrounds were studied. Receptive fields were mapped quantitatively using a white-noise stimulus; connectivity was assessed by cross-correlating the retinal and geniculate spike trains. Of the 205 pairs, 12 were determined to have monosynaptic connections. Both the likelihood that cells were connected and the strength of connections increased with increasing similarity between retinal and geniculate receptive fields. Connections were never found between cells with <50% spatial overlap between their centers. The results suggest that although geniculate neurons often receive input from several retinal afferents, these multiple afferents represent a select subset of the retinal ganglion cells with overlapping receptive-field centers.},

We found that both homosynaptic and heterosynaptic interactions increase the likelihood of driving a postsynaptic spike, although with different time courses. For two spikes traveling down a single geniculate axon, the second spike is more effective than the first for approximately 15 msec. For two spikes on separate axons, the interaction is faster (approximately 7 msec duration, approximately 2.5 msec time constant). Thus changes in firing rate are perhaps best relayed by homosynaptic interactions, whereas heterosynaptic interactions may help detect coincident spikes from different thalamic inputs.},

The spike time and count variability of parasol (magnocellular-projecting) retinal ganglion cells was examined in isolated macaque monkey retinas stimulated with repeated presentations of high contrast, spatially uniform intensity modulation. At the onset of clearly delineated periods of firing, retinal ganglion cells fired spikes time-locked to the stimulus with a variability across trials as low as 1 ms. Spike count variance across trials was much lower than the mean and sometimes approached the minimum variance possible with discrete counts, inconsistent with Poisson statistics expected from independently generated spikes. Spike time and count variability decreased systematically with stimulus strength. These findings were consistent with a model in which firing probability was determined by a stimulus-driven free firing rate modulated by a recovery function representing the action potential absolute and relative refractory period.},

abstract = {All visual signals the cortex receives are influenced by the perigeniculate sector (PGN) of the thalamic reticular nucleus, which receives input from relay cells in the lateral geniculate and provides feedback inhibition in return. Relay cells have been studied in quantitative depth; they behave in a roughly linear fashion and have receptive fields with a stereotyped center-surround structure. We know far less about reticular neurons. Qualitative studies indicate they simply pool ascending input to generate non-selective gain control. Yet the perigeniculate is complicated; local cells are densely interconnected and fire lengthy bursts. Thus, we employed quantitative methods to explore the perigeniculate using relay cells as controls. By adapting methods of spike-triggered averaging and covariance analysis for bursts, we identified both first and second order features that build reticular receptive fields. The shapes of these spatiotemporal subunits varied widely; no stereotyped pattern emerged. Companion experiments showed that the shape of the first but not second order features could be explained by the overlap of On and Off inputs to a given cell. Moreover, we assessed the predictive power of the receptive field and how much information each component subunit conveyed. Linear-non-linear (LN) models including multiple subunits performed better than those made with just one; further each subunit encoded different visual information. Model performance for reticular cells was always lesser than for relay cells, however, indicating that reticular cells process inputs non-linearly. All told, our results suggest that the perigeniculate encodes diverse visual features to selectively modulate activity transmitted downstream.},

abstract = {Saccadic eye movements are responsible for bringing relevant parts of the visual field onto the fovea for detailed analysis. Because the retina is physiologically unable to deliver sharp images at very high transsaccadic speeds, the visual system minimizes the repercussion of the blurry images we would otherwise perceive during transsaccadic vision by reducing general visual sensitivity and increasing the detection threshold for visual stimuli. Ruling out a pure retinal origin, the effects of saccadic suppression can be already observed some 75 ms before the onset of a saccadic eye movement and are maximal at the onset of motion. The perception of a briefly presented stimulus immediately before the onset of any retinal motion is thus impaired despite the fact that this stimulus is projected onto the stationary retina and is, therefore, physically identical to that presented when no saccadic programming is in course. In this functional magnetic resonance imaging event-related study, we flashed Gabor patches at different times before the onset of a horizontal saccade and measured blood oxygen level-dependent responses at their encoding regions in primary visual cortex (V1) while subjects judged the relative orientation of the stimuli. Closely matching the significant reduction in behavioral performance, the amplitude of the responses in V1 consistently decreased as the stimuli were presented closer to the saccadic onset. These results demonstrate that the neural processes underlying saccade programming transiently modulate cortical responses to briefly presented visual stimuli in areas as early a V1, providing additional evidence for the existence of an active saccadic suppression mechanism in humans.},

However, signals in one modality can influence the processing of signals from other modalities and recent studies suggest this cross-modal influence may occur early on, even in ‘unisensory’ areas. Some recent psychophysical studies have shown specific cross-modal effects between touch and vision during binocular rivalry, but these cannot completely rule out a response bias. To test for genuine cross-modal integration of haptic and visual signals, we investigated whether congruent haptic input could influence visual contrast sensitivity compared to incongruent haptic input in three psychophysical experiments using a two-interval, two-alternative forced-choice method to eliminate response bias. The initial experiment demonstrated that contrast thresholds for a visual grating were lower when exploring a haptic grating that shared the same orientation compared to an orthogonal orientation. Two subsequent experiments mapped the orientation and spatial frequency tunings for the congruent haptic facilitation of vision, finding a clear orientation tuning effect but not a spatial frequency tuning. In addition to an increased contrast sensitivity for iso-oriented visual-haptic gratings, we found a significant loss of sensitivity for orthogonally oriented visual-haptic gratings. We conclude that the tactile influence on vision is a result of a tactile input to orientation-tuned visual areas.},

Research findings vary in indicating a local processing bias or a global processing deficit, and often contradict each other. We have applied a formal meta-analytic approach and combined 56 articles that tested about 1,000 ASD participants and used a wide range of stimuli and tasks to investigate local and global visual processing in ASD. Overall, results show no enhanced local visual processing nor a deficit in global visual processing. Detailed analysis reveals a difference in the temporal pattern of the local-global balance, that is, slow global processing in individuals with ASD. Whereas task-dependent interaction effects are obtained, gender, age, and IQ of either participant groups seem to have no direct influence on performance.

abstract = {The ability of human observers to detect and discriminate a single feature of a visual image deteriorates markedly when the targeted feature is surrounded by others of a similar kind. This perceptual masking is mirrored by the suppressive effects of surround stimulation on the responses of neurons in primary visual cortex (area V1). Both perceptual and neuronal masking effects are partially relieved, however, if the targeted image feature is distinguished from surrounding features along some dimension, such as contour orientation. Masking relief is likely to play an important role in perceptual segmentation of complex images. Because dissimilar surfaces usually differ along multiple feature dimensions, we tested the possibility that those differences may influence segmentation in an invariant manner. As expected, we found that the presence of surrounding features resulted in perceptual masking and neuronal response suppression in area V1, but that either orientation or contrast polarity differences between the target and surrounding features was sufficient to partially relieve these effects. Simultaneous differences along both dimensions, however, yielded no greater relief from masking than did either difference alone. Although the averaged neuronal effects of orientation polarity cues were thus invariant, the time course over which these effects emerged after each stimulus appearance was different for the two cues. These findings refine our understanding of the functions of nonclassical receptive fields, and they support a key role for V1 neurons in surface segmentation.},

abstract = {Cortical state is characterized by ongoing rhythmic neural activity. Changes in rhythmic activity and thus in cortical state are shown to occur spontaneously in the anesthetized cat. We were interested in whether these state changes have an affect on the cortical processing of sensory stimuli. This was investigated by recording spontaneous and stimulus-evoked local field potentials and multi-unit neuronal activity (MUA) from trans-cortical electrode arrays in the visual cortex of the anesthetized cat. Changes in cortical state were identified by calculating the cross-correlation strength and cross-coherency, between MUA channels at different layers and on separate electrode arrays. Spontaneous changes in rhythmic activity were associated with changes in the strength of stimulus-evoked multiple unit responses of cortical neurons. The highest multi-unit responses were found in periods when low-frequency rhythms of the electroencephalogram increase in magnitude and high-frequency rhythms decrease. Such changes in evoked responses were maximal at layer IV, the input layer of the visual cortex. Our findings suggest that stimulus response magnitude depends on rhythmic state and reflects changes in functional connectivity within the visual cortex.},

abstract = {Behavioral measures such as expectancy and attention have been associated with the strength of synchronous neural activity. On this basis, it is hypothesized that synchronous activity affects our ability to detect and recognize visual objects. To investigate the role of synchronous activity in visual perception, we studied the magnitude and precision of correlated activity, before and after stimulus presentation within the visual cortex (V1), in relation to a monkey’s performance in a figure-ground discrimination task. We show that during the period of stimulus presentation a transition in synchronized activity occurs that is characterized by a reduction of the correlation peak height and width. Before stimulus onset, broad peak correlations are observed that change towards thin peak correlations after stimulus onset, due to a specific decrease of low-frequency components. The magnitude of the transition in correlated activity is larger, i.e. a stronger desynchronization occurs, when the animal perceives the stimulus correctly than when the animal fails to detect the stimulus. These results therefore show that a transition in synchronous firing is important for the detection of sensory stimuli. We hypothesize that the transition in synchrony reflects a change from loose and global neuronal interactions towards a finer temporal and spatial scale of neuronal interactions, and that such a change in neuronal interactions is required for figure-ground discrimination.},

abstract = {The cerebral cortex, with its conserved 6-layer structure, has inspired many unifying models of function. However, recent comparative studies of primary visual cortex have revealed considerable structural diversity, raising doubts about the possibility of an all-encompassing theory. This review examines similarities and differences in V1 across mammals. Gross laminar interconnections are relatively conserved. Major functional response classes are found universally or nearly universally. Orientation and spatial frequency tuning bandwidths are quite similar despite an enormous range of visual resolution across species, and orientation tuning is contrast-invariant. Nevertheless, there is considerable diversity in the abundance of different cell classes, laminar organization, functional architecture, and functional connectivity. Orientation-selective responses arise in different layers in different species. Some mammals have elaborate columnar architecture like orientation maps and ocular dominance bands, but others lack this organization with no apparent impact on single cell properties. Finally, local functional connectivity varies according to map structure: similar cells are connected in smooth map regions but dissimilar cells are linked in animals without maps. If there is a single structure/function relation for cortex, it must accommodate significant variations in cortical circuitry. Alternatively, natural selection may craft unique circuits that function differently in each species.},

The homological relationships among these cell classes and how receptive field (RF) properties of these cells compare with LGN cells in other mammals are poorly understood. To address these questions, we have characterized RF properties and laminar organization in LGN of a highly visual diurnal rodent, the gray squirrel, under isoflurane anesthesia. We identified three classes of LGN cells. One class found in layers 1 and 2 showed sustained, reliable firing, center-surround organization, and was almost exclusively linear in spatial summation. Another class, found in layer 3, showed short response latencies, transient and reliable firing, center-surround organization, and could show either linear (76%) or nonlinear (24%) spatial summation. A third, heterogeneous class found throughout the LGN but primarily in layer 3 showed highly variable responses, a variety of response latencies and could show either center-surround or noncenter-surround receptive field organization and either linear (77%) or nonlinear (23%) spatial summation. RF sizes of all cell classes showed little dependency on eccentricity, and all of these classes showed low contrast gains. When compared with LGN cells in other mammals, our data are consistent with the idea that all mammals contain three basic classes of LGN neurons, one showing reliable, sustained responses, and center-surround organization (X or P); another showing transient but reliable responses, short latencies, and center-surround organization (Y or M); and a third, highly variable and heterogeneous class of cells (W or K). Other properties such as dependency of receptive field size on eccentricity, linearity of spatial summation, and contrast gain appear to vary from species to species},

abstract = {In mammalian neocortex, the orderly arrangement of columns of neurons is thought to be a fundamental organizing principle. In primary visual cortex (V1), neurons respond preferentially to bars of a particular orientation, and, in many mammals, these orientation-selective cells are arranged in a semiregular, smoothly varying map across the cortical surface. Curiously, orientation maps have not been found in rodents or lagomorphs. To explore whether this lack of organization in previously studied rodents could be attributable to low visual acuity, poorly differentiated visual brain areas, or small absolute V1 size, we examined V1 organization of a larger, highly visual rodent, the gray squirrel. Using intrinsic signal optical imaging and single-cell recordings, we found no evidence of an orientation map, suggesting that formation of orientation maps depends on mechanisms not found in rodents. We did find robust orientation tuning of single cells, and this tuning was invariant to stimulus contrast. Therefore, it seems unlikely that orientation maps are important for orientation tuning or its contrast invariance in V1. In vertical electrode penetrations, we found little evidence for columnar organization of orientation-selective neurons and little evidence for local anisotropy of orientation preferences. We conclude that an orderly and columnar arrangement of functional response properties is not a universal characteristic of cortical architecture.},

We have thus re-investigated this in the geniculate A-laminae of the cat with an algorithm to correct this sampling bias. We used serial reconstructions with the electron microscope to determine the size of each terminal and synaptic type. We observed that RL (retinal) terminals are largest, F (local, GABAergic, inhibitory) terminals are intermediate in size, and RS (cortical and brainstem) terminals are smallest. We also found that synapses from RL terminals are largest, and thus most oversampled, and we used synaptic size data to correct for sampling errors. Doing so, we found that the relative synaptic percentages overall are 11.7% for RL terminals, 27.5% for F, and 60.8% for RS. Furthermore, we distinguished between relay cells and interneurons with post-embedding immunocytochemistry for GABA (relay cells are GABA negative and interneurons are GABA positive). Onto relay cells, RL terminals contributed 7.1%, F terminals contributed 30.9%, and RS terminals contributed 62.0%. Onto interneurons, RL terminals contributed 48.7%, F terminals contributed 24.4%, and RS terminals contributed 26.9%. We also found that RL terminals included many more separate synaptic contact zones (9.1 ± 1.6) than did F terminals (2.6 ± 0.2) or RS terminals (1.02 ± 0.02). We used these data plus the calculation of overall percentages of each synaptic type to compute the relative percentage of each terminal type in the neuropil: RL terminals represent 1.8%, F terminals represent 14.5%, and RS terminals represent 83.7%. We argue that this relative synaptic paucity is typical for driver inputs (from retina), whereas modulator inputs (all others) require many more synapses to achieve their function. J. Comp.

We recorded from all layers of the primary visual cortex (V1) and found that γ-waves are initiated in input layer 4 and propagate to the deep and superficial layers of cortex, whereas α-waves propagate in the opposite direction. Simultaneous recordings from V1 and downstream area V4 confirmed that γ- and α-waves propagate in the feedforward and feedback direction, respectively. Microstimulation in V1 elicited γ-oscillations in V4, whereas microstimulation in V4 elicited α-oscillations in V1, thus providing causal evidence for the opposite propagation of these rhythms. Furthermore, blocking NMDA receptors, thought to be involved in feedback processing, suppressed α while boosting γ. These results provide new insights into the relation between brain rhythms and cognition.},

Electrophysiological recordings in monkeys as well as theoretical models suggest that these top-down processes depend on NMDA receptor functioning. However, this underlying neural mechanism has not been tested in humans. We used fMRI multivoxel pattern analysis to compare the neural representations of ambiguous Mooney images before and after they were recognized with their unambiguous grayscale version. Additionally, we administered ketamine, an NMDA receptor antagonist, to interfere with this process. Our results demonstrate that after recognition, the pattern of brain activation elicited by a Mooney image is more similar to that of its easily recognizable grayscale version than to the pattern evoked by the identical Mooney image before recognition. Moreover, recognition of Mooney images decreased mean response; however, neural representations of separate images became more dissimilar. So from the neural perspective, unrecognizable Mooney images all “look the same”, whereas recognized Mooneys look different. We observed these effects in posterior fusiform part of lateral occipital cortex and in early visual cortex. Ketamine distorted these effects of recognition, but in early visual cortex only. This suggests that top-down processes from higher- to lower-level visual areas might operate via an NMDA pathway.},

abstract = {To create subjective experience, our brain must translate physical stimulus input by incorporating prior knowledge and expectations. For example, we perceive color and not wavelength information, and this in part depends on our past experience with colored objects (Hansen et al. 2006; Mitterer and de Ruiter 2008). Here, we investigated the influence of object knowledge on the neural substrates underlying subjective color vision. In a functional magnetic resonance imaging experiment, human subjects viewed a color that lay midway between red and green (ambiguous with respect to its distance from red and green) presented on either typical red (e.g., tomato), typical green (e.g., clover), or semantically meaningless (nonsense) objects. Using decoding techniques, we could predict whether subjects viewed the ambiguous color on typical red or typical green objects based on the neural response of veridical red and green. This shift of neural response for the ambiguous color did not occur for nonsense objects. The modulation of neural responses was observed in visual areas (V3, V4, VO1, lateral occipital complex) involved in color and object processing, as well as frontal areas. This demonstrates that object memory influences wavelength information relatively early in the human visual system to produce subjective color vision.},

Recent studies have suggested, however, that discriminating isolated natural scenes, objects or faces might be possible in the near absence of attention. It is still unclear what mechanisms underlie this remarkable ability. Here, we investigate whether the binding problem affects natural objects in the same way as other stimuli: is interference observed when two natural objects or scenes must be simultaneously processed? We show that in the presence of competing objects, performance in the near absence of attention depends on the relative distance between stimuli: discrimination is good for stimuli far enough apart, and poor for close enough stimuli. In contrast, seemingly simpler but unfamiliar synthetic objects could not be bound in the near absence of attention, independent of the distance between them. Thus, natural objects are special in that they suffer from the binding problem, but only locally. We surmise that this particular type of local binding for natural objects and scenes could be “hardwired” by dedicated neuronal populations.},

abstract = {UNLABELLED: The cone ‘synaptic complex’ is a unique structure in which a single presynaptic axon secretes glutamate onto processes of bipolar cells (both ON and OFF) and horizontal cells. In turn, the horizontal cell processes antagonize cone and bipolar responses to glutamate (probably by GABA). What still remains largely unknown is the molecular identity of the postsynaptic receptors and their exact locations. We identified several subunits of the glutamate receptor and the GABAA receptor expressed at the cone synaptic complex and localized them ultrastructurally. Glutamate receptors: (i) Invaginating (probably ON) bipolar dendrites in the monkey and rat express the metabotropic glutamate receptor, mGluR6. The stain is intense on the dendritic membrane where it first enters the invagination, and weak at the tip nearest to the ribbon. The cone membrane is electron-dense where it apposes the intense stain for mGluR6. Surprisingly, invaginating bipolar dendrites in the cat also express the AMPA receptor subunits, GluR2/3 and GluR4. (ii) Dendrites forming basal contacts in the cat (probably OFF) express the AMPA subunits GluR2/3, GluR4, and also the kainate subunit, GluR6/7. The stain is especially intense at the dendritic tips in apposition to electron-dense regions of cone membrane. (iii) Horizontal cells in the cat express the AMPA subunits GluR2/3, GluR4 and the kainate subunit, GluR6/7. The stain is strongest in the cytosol of somas and primary dendrites, but is also present in the invaginating terminals where it localizes to the membrane subjacent to the ribbon. GABAA receptors: (i) ON and OFF bipolar dendrites in the monkey express the alpha 1 and beta 2/3 subunits. The stain is localized to the bipolar cell membrane in apposition to horizontal cell processes. (ii) Cones did not express the GABAA subunits tested by immunocytochemistry, but beta 3 mRNA was amplified by RT-PCR from rat photoreceptors. CONCLUSIONS: (i) mGluR6 receptors concentrate on dendrites at the base of the invagination rather than at the apex. This implies that receptors at both ‘invaginating’ and ‘basal’ contacts lie roughly equidistant from the release sites and should therefore receive similar spatiotemporal concentrations of glutamate. (ii) The ‘cone’ membrane is electron-dense opposite to the receptor sites on both ON and OFF bipolar cells. This suggests a special role for this region in synaptic transmission. Possibly, these densities signify a transporter that would regulate glutamate concentration at sites remote (> 200 nm) from the locus of vesicle release.},

We now extend this result to serotonergic agonists, using rat thalamic brain slices and whole-cell, current- and voltage-clamp recordings from relay cells in various first order (the lateral geniculate nucleus, the ventral posterior nucleus, and the ventral portion of the medial geniculate body) and higher order nuclei (the lateral posterior, the posterior medial nucleus, and the dorsal portion of the medial geniculate body). Similar to the effects of muscarinic agonists, we found that first and most higher order relay cells were depolarized by serotonergic agonists, but 15% of higher order relay cells responded with hyperpolarization. Thus different subsets of higher order relay cells are hyperpolarized by these modulatory systems, which could have implications for the transfer of information between cortical areas.},

In a companion paper we showed how a Bootstrap evaluation of the peaks in the smoothed diagonals of the JPSTH may be used to establish the likely validity of apparent time-varying correlation. As noted in earlier studies by Brody and Ben-Shaul et al., trial-to-trial variation can confound correlation and synchrony effects. In this paper we elaborate on that observation, and present a method of estimating the time-dependent trial-to-trial variation in spike trains that may exceed the natural variation displayed by Poisson and non-Poisson point processes. The statistical problem is somewhat subtle because relatively few spikes per trial are available for estimating a firing-rate function that fluctuates over time. The method developed here decomposes the spike-train variability into a stimulus-related component and a trial-specific component, allowing many degrees of freedom to characterize the former while assuming a small number suffices to characterize the latter. The Bootstrap significance test of the companion paper is then modified to accommodate these general excitability effects. This methodology allows an investigator to assess whether excitability effects are constant or time-varying, and whether they are shared by two neurons. In data from two V1 neurons we find that highly statistically significant evidence of dependency disappears after adjustment for time-varying trial-to-trial variation.},

abstract = {In a neural population driven by a simple grating stimulus, different subpopulations are maximally informative about changes to the grating’s orientation and contrast. In theory, observers should attend to the optimal subpopulation when switching between orientation and contrast discrimination tasks. Here we used source-imaged, steady-state visual evoked potentials and visual psychophysics to determine whether this is the case. Observers fixated centrally while static targets were presented bilaterally along with a cue indicating task type (contrast or orientation modulation detection) and task location (left or right). Changes in neuronal activity were measured by quantifying frequency-tagged responses from flickering “reporter” gratings surrounding the targets. To determine the orientation tuning of attentionally modulated neurons, we measured responses for three different probe-reporter angles: 0, 20, and 45 degrees. We estimated frequency-tagged cortical activity using a minimum norm inverse procedure combined with realistic MR-derived head models and retinotopically mapped visual areas. Estimates of neural activity from regions of interest centered on V1 showed that attention to a spatial location clearly increased the amplitude of the neural response in that location. More importantly, the pattern of modulation depended on the task. For orientation discrimination, attentional modulation showed a sharp peak in the population tuned 20 degrees from the target orientation, whereas for contrast discrimination the enhancement was more broadly tuned. Similar tuning functions for orientation and contrast discrimination were obtained from psychophysical adaptation studies. These findings indicate that humans attend selectively to the most informative neural population and that these populations change depending on the nature of the task.},

abstract = {Human early visual cortex was traditionally thought to process simple visual features such as orientation, contrast, and spatial frequency via feedforward input from the lateral geniculate nucleus (e.g., [ 1 ]). However, the role of nonretinal influence on early visual cortex is so far insufficiently investigated despite much evidence that feedback connections greatly outnumber feedforward connections [ 2–5 ]. Here, we explored in five fMRI experiments how information originating from audition and imagery affects the brain activity patterns in early visual cortex in the absence of any feedforward visual stimulation. We show that category-specific information from both complex natural sounds and imagery can be read out from early visual cortex activity in blindfolded participants. The coding of nonretinal information in the activity patterns of early visual cortex is common across actual auditory perception and imagery and may be mediated by higher-level multisensory areas. Furthermore, this coding is robust to mild manipulations of attention and working memory but affected by orthogonal, cognitively demanding visuospatial processing. Crucially, the information fed down to early visual cortex is category specific and generalizes to sound exemplars of the same category, providing evidence for abstract information feedback rather than precise pictorial feedback. Our results suggest that early visual cortex receives nonretinal input from other brain areas when it is generated by auditory perception and/or imagery, and this input carries common abstract information. Our findings are compatible with feedback of predictive information to the earliest visual input level (e.g., [ 6 ]), in line with predictive coding models [ 7–10 ].},

The usual nalysis strategy is fundamentally identical across these contexts—it amounts to calculating the average value of the high-dimensional variable for each value of the categorical variable and comparing these results by subtraction. Though intuitive and straightforward, this procedure may be inaccurate or inefficient and may overlook important details. Sophisticated approaches have been developed within these several experimental contexts, but they are rarely applied beyond the context in which they were developed.

The second-order frequency response of X cells was much smaller than the first-order frequency response at all spatial frequencies. The spatial phase and spatial frequency dependence of the first-order frequency response in Y cells in some ways resembled that of X cells. However, the Y first-order response declined to zero at a much lower spatial frequency than in X cells. Furthermore, the second-order frequency response was larger in Y cells; the second-order frequency components became the dominant part of the response for patterns of high spatial frequency. This implies that the receptive field center and surround mechanisms are physiologically quite different in Y cells from those in X cells, and that the Y cells also receive excitatory drive from an additional nonlinear receptive field mechanism.},

abstract = {This study concerns the properties of neurons carrying signals for colour vision in primates. We investigated the variability of responses of individual parvocellular lateral geniculate neurons of dichromatic and trichromatic marmosets to drifting sinusoidal luminance and chromatic gratings. Response variability was quantified by the cycle-to-cycle variation in Fourier components of the response. Averaged across the population, the variability at low contrasts was greater than predicted by a Poisson process, and at high contrasts the responses were approximately 40% more variable than responses at low contrasts. The contrast-dependent increase in variability was nevertheless below that expected from the increase in firing rate. Variability falls below the Poisson prediction at high contrast, and intrinsic variability of the spike train decreases as contrast increases. Thus, while deeply modulated responses in parvocellular cells have a larger absolute variability than weakly modulated ones, they have a more favourable signal: noise ratio than predicted by a Poisson process. Similar results were obtained from a small sample of magnocellular and koniocellular (’blue-on’) neurons. For parvocellular neurons with pronounced colour opponency, chromatic responses were, on average, less variable (10-15%, p<0.01) than luminance responses of equal magnitude. Conversely, non-opponent parvocellular neurons showed the opposite tendency. This is consistent with a supra-additive noise source prior to combination of cone signals. In summary, though variability of parvocellular neurons is largely independent of the way in which they combine cone signals, the noise characteristics of retinal circuitry may augment specialization of parvocellular neurons to signal luminance or chromatic contrast.},

year = {2006}, 
abstract = {Neurons in primary visual cortex are widely considered to be oriented filters or energy detectors that perform one-dimensional feature analysis. The main deviations from this picture are generally thought to include gain controls and modulatory influences. Here we investigate receptive field (RF) properties of single neurons with localized two-dimensional stimuli, the two-dimensional Hermite functions (TDHs). TDHs can be grouped into distinct complete orthonormal bases that are matched in contrast energy, spatial extent, and spatial frequency content but differ in two-dimensional form, and thus can be used to probe spatially specific nonlinearities. Here we use two such bases: Cartesian TDHs, which resemble vignetted gratings and checkerboards, and polar TDHs, which resemble vignetted annuli and dartboards. Of 63 isolated units, 51 responded to TDH stimuli. In 37/51 units, we found significant differences in overall response size (21/51) or apparent RF shape (28/51) that depended on which basis set was used. Because of the properties of the TDH stimuli, these findings are inconsistent with simple feedforward nonlinearities and with many variants of energy models. Rather, they imply the presence of nonlinearities that are not local in either space or spatial frequency. Units showing these differences were present to a similar degree in cat and monkey, in simple and complex cells, and in supragranular, infragranular, and granular layers. We thus find a widely distributed neurophysiological substrate for two-dimensional spatial analysis at the earliest stages of cortical processing. Moreover, the population pattern of tuning to TDH functions suggests that V1 neurons sample not only orientations, but a larger space of two-dimensional form, in an even-handed manner.},

abstract = {Orientation sensitivity was tested, using moving bars as stimuli, in 136 LGN cells in normal cats and 82 LGN cells in cats with areas 17 and 18 lesioned. The responses of most neurones showed some dependence on the orientation of the line stimulus. The orientation bias was more pronounced for long, narrow bars moving at rather slow velocities. Length-response curves revealed less end-inhibition along the optimum orientation than along the non-optimum orientation. Thiry-two percent of the cells in the normal cats and 50% in the lesioned animals responded best to orientations within 10 degrees of the vertical or horizontal. The oblique orientations were represented poorly in the lesioned group. Thus the corticogeniculate feedback may serve to confer a more uniform distribution of orientation preferences on the LGN. It is suggested that the orientation biases of LGN neurones may play a role in building orientation-selective cells in the visual cortex. Further, the preferences for horizontal and vertical orientations in the LGN may explain the preferences for these orientations reported for visual cortical cells.

abstract = {The lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) contains a unique and numerous class of cells called lagged cells, which introduce a time delay into the neural signal provided to cortex. Previous studies have shown that this delay is dependent on GABA(A) receptors within the LGN. Furthermore, lagged cells have distinct integrative properties with a slower rising, more sustained, and overall lower firing rates than nonlagged cells. We have recorded intracellularly from lagged cells in the cat LGN and found a unique property of their retinal inputs that underlies both their temporal and integrative visual response properties. Lagged cell EPSPs, which often derive from a single retinal input, have smaller amplitudes, repolarize more quickly, and are followed by a Cl(-)-dependent hyperpolarization compared with nonlagged cells. The Cl(-)-dependent hyperpolarization sums early in the visual response generating a powerful synaptic inhibition that coincides with the peak frequency of retinal input and delays the spike response in lagged cells. The hyperpolarization subsides rapidly over ∼20-40 ms allowing for slow summation of the retinal input leading to the visual spike response. Given the tight association of single retinal EPSPs and the following inhibition, we propose that both functional properties result from the triadic circuitry prevalent in the LGN and particularly prominent in lagged X-cells. Thus, our results show for the first time a dynamic interaction of retinal excitation and fast feedforward inhibition that determines the integrative properties and the delay in firing of lagged cells.},

abstract = {Plaid stimuli are often used to investigate the mechanisms involved in the integration and segregation of motion information. Considering the perceptual importance of such mechanisms, only a very limited number of visual brain areas have been found to be specifically involved in motion integration. These are the human (h)MT+ complex, area V3 and the pulvinar. The hMT+ complex can be functionally subdivided into two separate areas, middle temporal area (MT) and medial superior temporal area (MST); however, it is currently unclear whether these distinct sub-regions have different responses to plaid stimuli. To address this issue we used functional magnetic resonance imaging to quantify the relative response of MT and MST to component and pattern motion. Participants viewed plaid stimuli that were constrained to result in the perception of either component motion (segregation of motion information) or pattern motion (integration of motion information). MT/MST segregation was achieved using a moving dot stimulus that allowed stimulation of each visual hemifield either in unison or separately. We found pattern motion selective responses in both MT and MST. Consistent with previous reports, activity indicative of pattern motion selectivity was also found in the pulvinar as well as in other extrastriate areas. These results demonstrate that MT, MST and the pulvinar are involved in the complex motion integration mechanisms that are triggered by plaid stimuli. This reinforces the concept that integrative computations take place in a distributed neuronal circuit both in cortical and sub-cortical networks.},

Functional magnetic resonance imaging studies in humans aimed at understanding this ongoing activity have shown that spontaneous fluctuations of the blood-oxygen-level-dependent signal occur continuously in the resting state. In humans, these fluctuations are temporally coherent within widely distributed cortical systems that recapitulate the functional architecture of responses evoked by experimentally administered tasks2, 3, 4, 5, 6. Here, we show that the same phenomenon is present in anaesthetized monkeys even at anaesthetic levels known to induce profound loss of consciousness. We specifically demonstrate coherent spontaneous fluctuations within three well known systems (oculomotor, somatomotor and visual) and the ‘default’ system, a set of brain regions thought by some to support uniquely human capabilities. Our results indicate that coherent system fluctuations probably reflect an evolutionarily conserved aspect of brain functional organization that transcends levels of consciousness.},

We also manipulated information about the orientation of the picture surface. When binocular information for surface orientation was available, perceived shape was nearly invariant across a wide range of viewing angles. By varying the projection angle and the position of a stimulus in the picture, we found that invariance is achieved through an estimate of local surface orientation, not from geometric information in the picture.

abstract = {Neurones of the mammalian primary visual cortex have the remarkable property of being selective for the orientation of visual contours. It has been controversial whether the selectivity arises from intracortical mechanisms, from the pattern of afferent connectivity from lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) to cortical cells or from the sharpening of a bias that is already present in the responses of many geniculate cells. To investigate this, we employed a variation of an electrical stimulation protocol in the LGN that has been claimed to suppress intracortical inputs and isolate the raw geniculocortical input to a striate cortical cell. Such stimulation led to a sharpening of the orientation sensitivity of geniculate cells themselves and some broadening of cortical orientation selectivity. These findings are consistent with the idea that non-specific inhibition of the signals from LGN cells which exhibit an orientation bias can generate the sharp orientation selectivity of primary visual cortical cells. This obviates the need for an excitatory convergence from geniculate cells whose receptive fields are arranged along a row in visual space as in the classical model and provides a framework for orientation sensitivity originating in the retina and getting sharpened through inhibition at higher levels of the visual pathway.},

abstract = {We studied the effects of reversible cooling between 35 and 7 C on membrane properties and spike generation of cells in slices of rat visual cortex. Cooling led to a depolarization of the neurones and an increase of the input resistance, thus bringing the cells closer to spiking threshold. Excitability, measured with intracellular current steps, increased with cooling. Synaptic stimuli were most efficient in producing spikes at room temperature, but strong stimulation could evoke spikes even below 10 C. Spike width and total area increased with cooling, and spike amplitude was maximal between 12 and 20 C. Repetitive firing was enhanced in some cells by cooling to 20-25 C, but was always suppressed at lower temperatures. With cooling, passive potassium conductance decreased and the voltage-gated potassium current had a higher activation threshold and lower amplitude. At the same time, neither passive sodium conductance nor the activation threshold of voltage-dependent sodium channels changed. Therefore changing the temperature modifies the ratio between potassium and sodium conductances, and thus alters basic membrane properties. Data from two cells recorded in slices of cat visual cortex suggest a similar temperature dependence of the membrane properties of neocortical neurones to that described above in the rat. These results provide a framework for comparison of the data recorded at different temperatures, but also show the limitations of extending the conclusions drawn from in vitro data obtained at room temperature to physiological temperatures. Further, when cooling is used as an inactivation tool in vivo, it should be taken into account that the mechanism of inactivation is a depolarization block. Only a region cooled below 10 C is reliably silenced, but it is always surrounded by a domain of hyperexcitable cells.},

The effect of moderate cooling on spike generation was increased excitability, most probably due to the ease with which a depolarized membrane potential could be brought to spike threshold by a sufficiently strong excitatory postsynaptic potential. Stimuli that were subthreshold above 30 degrees C could readily generate spikes at room temperature. Only at well below 10 degrees C could action potentials be completely suppressed. Paired-pulse facilitation was less at lower temperatures, indicating that synaptic dynamics are different at room temperature as compared with physiological temperatures. These results have important implications for extrapolating in vitro data obtained at room temperatures to higher temperatures. The data also emphasize that inactivation by cooling might be a useful tool for studying interactions between brain regions, but the data recorded within the cooled area do not allow reliable conclusions to be drawn about neural operations at normal temperatures.},

abstract = {Electrical synapses (gap junctions) play a pivotal role in the synchronization of neuronal ensembles which also makes them likely agonists of pathological brain activity. Although large body of experimental data and theoretical considerations indicate that coupling neurons by electrical synapses promotes synchronous activity (and thus is potentially epileptogenic), some recent evidence questions the hypothesis of gap junctions being among purely epileptogenic factors. In particular, an expression of inter-neuronal gap junctions is often found to be higher after the experimentally induced seizures than before. Here we used a computational modeling approach to address the role of neuronal gap junctions in shaping the stability of a network to perturbations that are often associated with the onset of epileptic seizures. We show that under some circumstances, the addition of gap junctions can increase the dynamical stability of a network and thus suppress the collective electrical activity associated with seizures. This implies that the experimentally observed post-seizure additions of gap junctions could serve to prevent further escalations, suggesting furthermore that they are a consequence of an adaptive response of the neuronal network to the pathological activity. However, if the seizures are strong and persistent, our model predicts the existence of a critical tipping point after which additional gap junctions no longer suppress but strongly facilitate the escalation of epileptic seizures. Our results thus reveal a complex role of electrical coupling in relation to epileptiform events. Which dynamic scenario (seizure suppression or seizure escalation) is ultimately adopted by the network depends critically on the strength and duration of seizures, in turn emphasizing the importance of temporal and causal aspects when linking gap junctions with epilepsy.},

abstract = {A long history of studies of perception has shown that the visual system organizes the incoming information early on, interpreting the 2D image in terms of a 3D world and producing a structure that provides perceptual continuity and enables object-based attention. Recordings from monkey visual cortex show that many neurons, especially in area V2, are selective for border ownership. These neurons are edge selective and have ordinary classical receptive fields (CRF), but in addition their responses are modulated (enhanced or suppressed) depending on the location of a ‘figure’ relative to the edge in their receptive field. Each neuron has a fixed preference for location on one side or the other. This selectivity is derived from the image context far beyond the CRF. This paper reviews evidence indicating that border ownership selectivity reflects the formation of early object representations (’proto-objects’). The evidence includes experiments showing (1) reversal of border ownership signals with change of perceived object structure, (2) border ownership specific enhancement of responses in object-based selective attention, (3) persistence of border ownership signals in accordance with continuity of object perception, and (4) remapping of border ownership signals across saccades and object movements. Findings 1 and 2 can be explained by hypothetical grouping circuits that sum contour feature signals in search of objectness, and, via recurrent projections, enhance the corresponding low-level feature signals. Findings 3 and 4 might be explained by assuming that the activity of grouping circuits persists and can be remapped. Grouping, persistence, and remapping are fundamental operations of vision. Finding these operations manifest in low-level visual areas challenges traditional views of visual processing. New computational models need to be developed for a comprehensive understanding of the function of the visual cortex.},

This study examined the reading performance of normally sighted human subjects using a simulation of three thalamic visual prostheses that varied in phosphene count, to help understand the level of functional ability afforded by thalamic designs in a task of daily living. Reading accuracy, reading speed, and reading acuity of 20 subjects were measured as a function of letter size, using a task based on the MNREAD chart. Results showed that fluid reading was feasible with appropriate combinations of letter size and phosphene count, and performance degraded smoothly as font size was decreased, with an approximate doubling of phosphene count resulting in an increase of 0.2 logMAR in acuity. Results here were consistent with previous results from our laboratory. Results were also consistent with those from the literature, despite using naive subjects who were not trained on the simulator, in contrast to other reports.},

Further, we provide empirical evidence for such a network in the analysis of event-related MEG-components to rhythmic incongruence in the context of strong metric anticipation. This is seen in a mismatch negativity (MMNm) and a subsequent P3am component, which have the properties of an error term and a subsequent evaluation in a predictive coding framework. There were both quantitative and qualitative differences in the evoked responses in expert jazz musicians compared with rhythmically unskilled non-musicians. We propose that these differences trace a functional adaptation and/or a genetic pre-disposition in experts which allows for a more precise rhythmic prediction.},

Similar distributions of histaminergic neuronal cell bodies and fibers have been reported in the brains of other mammals and nonmammalian vertebrates. As expected from the widespread distributions of the efferent fibers, the central histaminergic neuron system seems to be involved in multiple functions in the brain. The results of intracerebral injection of histamine and administration of alpha-fluoromethylhistidine (FMH), which depletes brain histamine level, suggest that the central histaminergic system may modulate feeding, drinking and sexual behaviors, sleep-wakefulness and circadian rhythm, neuroendocrine and cardiovascular controls and thermoregulation.},

abstract = {We investigated psychophysically whether feature-based attention modulates the perception of figure-ground (F-G) segregation and, based on the results, we investigated computationally the neural mechanisms underlying attention modulation. In the psychophysical experiments, the attention of participants was drawn to a specific motion direction and they were then asked to judge the side of figure in an ambiguous figure with surfaces consisting of distinct motion directions. The results of these experiments showed that the surface consisting of the attended direction of motion was more frequently observed as figure, with a degree comparable to that of spatial attention (Wagatsuma et al., 2008). These experiments also showed that perception was dependent on the distribution of feature contrast, specifically the motion direction differences. These results led us to hypothesize that feature-based attention functions in a framework similar to that of spatial attention. We proposed a V1-V2 model in which feature-based attention modulates the contrast of low-level feature in V1, and this modulation of contrast changes directly the surround modulation of border-ownership-selective cells in V2; thus, perception of F-G is biased. The model exhibited good agreement with human perception in the magnitude of attention modulation and its invariance among stimuli. These results indicate that early-level features that are modified by feature-based attention alter subsequent processing along afferent pathway, and that such modification could even change the perception of object.},

Because of its continued relevance in modern psychology, this centennial anniversary is an excellent opportunity to take stock of what Gestalt psychology has offered and how it has changed since its inception. We first introduce the key findings and ideas in the Berlin school of Gestalt psychology, and then briefly sketch its development, rise, and fall. Next, we discuss its empirical and conceptual problems, and indicate how they are addressed in contemporary research on perceptual grouping and figure-ground organization. In particular, we review the principles of grouping, both classical (e.g., proximity, similarity, common fate, good continuation, closure, symmetry, parallelism) and new (e.g., synchrony, common region, element and uniform connectedness), and their role in contour integration and completion. We then review classic and new image-based principles of figure-ground organization, how it is influenced by past experience and attention, and how it relates to shape and depth perception. After an integrated review of the neural mechanisms involved in contour grouping, border ownership, and figure-ground perception, we conclude by evaluating what modern vision science has offered compared to traditional Gestalt psychology, whether we can speak of a Gestalt revival, and where the remaining limitations and challenges lie. A better integration of this research tradition with the rest of vision science requires further progress regarding the conceptual and theoretical foundations of the Gestalt approach, which is the focus of a second review article.},

The spatio-temporal characteristic of cells’ RFs was tested with light spot randomly presented at different points along the receptive field axis. The cessation of cortical input decreased spontaneous activity of most of the LGN cells (64%; as compared to 36% with increased background firing). Similarly, their visually evoked responses were reduced (70% cells; compared to 24% with increased response) and extent of central excitatory domains diminished. In contrast, the majority of PGN neurons increased their spontaneous activity (62%; compared to 38% with decreased firing rate). Cortical cooling resulted also in a decrease of the ON and OFF central responses of most PGN cells (55%; as compared to 20% with increased responses). The described effects were more pronounced within the population of cells in X than in Y pathway. Although the removal of descending cortical excitation disturbed the balance of activity within the network of thalamic cells the gain of the geniculate relay was preserved. We conclude that the main role exerted by the cortico-thalamic pathway serves facilitation of the ascending retino-cortical flow of visual information at the level of lateral geniculate nucleus.},

abstract = {Neurons in area MT/V5 of the macaque visual cortex encode visual motion. Some cells are selective for the motion of oriented features (component direction selective, CDS); others respond to the true direction of complex patterns (pattern direction selective, PDS). There is a continuum of selectivity in MT, with CDS cells at one extreme and PDS cells at the other; we compute a pattern index that captures this variation. It is unknown how a neuron’s pattern index is related to its other tuning characteristics. We therefore analyzed the responses of 792 MT cells recorded in the course of other experiments from opiate-anesthetized macaque monkeys, as a function of the direction, spatial frequency, drift rate, size, and contrast of sinusoidal gratings, and of the direction and speed of random-dot textures. We also compared MT responses to those of 718 V1 cells. As expected, MT cells with higher pattern index tended to have stronger direction selectivity, broader direction tuning to gratings, and responded better to plaids than to gratings. Strongly PDS cells also tended to have smaller receptive fields and stronger surround suppression. Interestingly, they also responded preferentially to higher drift rates and higher speeds of moving dots. The spatial frequency preferences of PDS cells depended strongly on their preferred temporal frequencies, while these preferences were independent in component-selective cells. Pattern selectivity is associated with many response properties of MT cells, but not with any particular property. Pattern signals are thus available in association with other signals exported by MT.},

A previous psychophysical study showed that human subjects can perceive expansion motion in texture stimuli that exhibit increases in the scale of image elements but no consistent optic flow pattern. The neural mechanisms by which the scale-change information is processed remain unknown. Here, we measured the responses of cat V1 and the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons to a sequence of random images whose spatial frequency spectrum changed over time (i.e., average spatial scale expanded or contracted). We found that V1 neurons exhibit direction sensitivity to scale changes, with more cells preferring expansion than contraction motion. This direction sensitivity can be partly accounted for by the spectrotemporal receptive field of V1 neurons. Comparison of the direction sensitivity between V1 and LGN neurons showed that the sensitivity in V1 may originate from LGN neurons. Repetitive stimulation with expansion or contraction motion can decrease the sensitivity to the adapted direction in V1, and the effect can be transferred interocularly, suggesting that intracortical connections may be critically involved in the adaptation. Together, our results suggest that direction sensitivity to scale change in V1 may contribute to motion-in-depth processing},

Cells fire tonically when depolarized, as during waking. Thus, mode of firing is usually associated with behavioral state. Growing evidence, however, suggests that sensory processing involves both burst and tonic spikes. To ask if visually evoked synaptic responses induce each type of firing, we recorded intracellular responses to natural movies from relay cells and developed methods to map the receptive fields of the excitation and inhibition that the images evoked. In addition to tonic spikes, the movies routinely elicited lasting inhibition from the center of the receptive field that permitted bursts to fire.

Microscopically, however, the responses of the two types of cells had opposite profiles. Excitatory stimuli drove trains of single excitatory postsynaptic potentials in relay cells, but graded depolarizations in interneurons. Conversely, suppressive stimuli evoked smooth hyperpolarizations in relay cells and unitary inhibitory postsynaptic potentials in interneurons. Computational analyses suggested that these complementary patterns of response help to preserve information encoded in the fine timing of retinal spikes and to increase the amount of information transmitted to cortex.},

Although evidence suggests that gamma-band (30-100 Hz) neural activity contributes to local BOLD signals, the neural basis of interareal BOLD correlations is unclear. We first defined a visual network in monkeys based on converging evidence from interareal BOLD correlations during a fixation task, task-free state, and anesthesia, and then simultaneously recorded local field potentials (LFPs) from the same four network areas in the task-free state. Low-frequency oscillations (<20 Hz), and not gamma activity, predominantly contributed to interareal BOLD correlations. The low-frequency oscillations also influenced local processing by modulating gamma activity within individual areas. We suggest that such cross-frequency coupling links local BOLD signals to BOLD correlations across distributed networks.},

abstract = {Humans can learn to abstract and conceptualize the shared visual features defining an object category in object learning. Therefore, learning is generalizable to transformations of familiar objects and even to new objects that differ in other physical properties. In contrast, visual perceptual learning (VPL), improvement in discriminating fine differences of a basic visual feature through training, is commonly regarded as specific and low-level learning because the improvement often disappears when the trained stimulus is simply relocated or rotated in the visual field. Such location and orientation specificity is taken as evidence for neural plasticity in primary visual cortex (V1) or improved readout of V1 signals. However, new training methods have shown complete VPL transfer across stimulus locations and orientations, suggesting the involvement of high-level cognitive processes. Here we report that VPL bears similar properties of object learning. Specifically, we found that orientation discrimination learning is completely transferrable between luminance gratings initially encoded in V1 and bilaterally symmetric dot patterns encoded in higher visual cortex. Similarly, motion direction discrimination learning is transferable between first- and second-order motion signals. These results suggest that VPL can take place at a conceptual level and generalize to stimuli with different physical properties. Our findings thus reconcile perceptual and object learning into a unified framework.

SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT Training in object recognition can produce a learning effect that is applicable to new viewing conditions or even to new objects with different physical properties. However, perceptual learning has long been regarded as a low-level form of learning because of its specificity to the trained stimulus conditions. Here we demonstrate with new training tactics that visual perceptual learning is completely transferrable between distinct physical stimuli. This finding indicates that perceptual learning also operates at a conceptual level in a stimulus-invariant manner.},

The optimal range of synchronous inputs was influenced by the balance of background excitation and inhibition in the cortex, which could gate the flow of information into the cortex.

To provide a more subtle insight into the role of the feedback we have adopted a different strategy. Focal iontophoretic application of GABAA or GABA B antagonists has been used to provide a local enhancement of visual responsiveness in layer 6 of the visual cortex. Simultaneous recordings from triadic electrode arrays in the LGN has enabled us to test the effects of this on groups of three LGN cells that sample different locations in visual space. Electrodes were placed so that the receptive field of the V1 location was either immediately adjacent to, partially overlapping or totally overlapping the area of visual space covered by the three sets of LGN receptive fields. Responses were examined with a range of flashing and moving stimuli. Enhancement of visual responsiveness in layer 6 resulted in many changes in LGN cell responses. We routinely observed either increases or decreases in response magnitude. However, the most interesting effects were changes in receptive field size as judged by small flashing stimuli, shifts in the spatial focus of the receptive fields and changes in the spatial summation properties to drifting grating stimuli of varying diameter but not to stationary flashing stimuli of varying diameter. These data suggest a profound and subtle pattern of influence from the feedback system with the ability to exert a strong influence on the spatial characteristics of the receptive field.},

Recently these have been linked to two different types of sensory transmission in the visual system (Sherman, Neuroscience 2000, 101, 243-276), with the burst mode aiding signal detection and the tonic mode accurate signal reconstruction. Both patterns are seen in normal awake animals. We have previously reported that the use of micro-iontophoretic application of drugs to produce a focal enhancement of visual responses of cells in layer 6 of the cat primary visual cortex (V1) produces changes in response magnitude, receptive field shape and receptive field size in LGN cells (Wang et al Soc NSc Abs 2000). Here we show that this focal enhancement of layer 6 cell visual responses in V1 changes the balance of the onset transient (here equated with burst) and sustained (here equated with tonic) component of LGN cell responses to flashed stimuli. We compared the responses of LGN cells to a stationary flashing stimulus of varying diameter and contrast, centred on their receptive field, before during and after focal enhancement of layer 6 cell visual responses. Of the cells so far studied 50% showed a relative enhancement of the burst versus the tonic component of the response during drug application in layer 6 and 28% showed the converse. Throughout our data these two components made differential contributions to the area summation curve and shifting the balance between the two changed the shape and focus of the curve. The data suggest a capacity for a stimulus linked, focal and cortically initiated switch in LGN cell transmission mode.},

These transformations enable downstream neurons to recode information they receive from earlier stages. Using the retinothalamic synapse as a model system, we developed a theoretical framework to identify stimulus features that are inherited, gained, or lost across stages. Specifically, we observed that thalamic spikes encode novel, emergent, temporal features not conveyed by single retinal spikes. Furthermore, we found that thalamic spikes are not only more informative than retinal ones, as expected, but also more independent. Next, we asked how thalamic spikes gain sensitivity to the emergent features. Explicitly, we found that the emergent features are encoded by retinal spike pairs and then recoded into independent thalamic spikes. Finally, we built a model of synaptic transmission that reproduced our observations. Thus, our results established a link between synaptic mechanisms and the recoding of sensory information.},

Simultaneous single-unit recordings in the thalamus and cortex in anesthetized rats showed that adaptation differentially influenced thalamus and cortex in a manner that fundamentally changed the nature of information conveyed about vibrissa motion. Using an ideal observer of cortical activity, we found that performance in detecting vibrissal deflections degraded with adaptation while performance in discriminating among vibrissal deflections of different velocities was enhanced, a trend not observed in thalamus. Analysis of simultaneously recorded thalamic neurons did reveal, however, an analogous adaptive change in thalamic synchrony that mirrored the cortical response. An integrate-and-fire model using experimentally measured thalamic input reproduced the observed transformations. The results here suggest a shift in coding strategy with adaptation that directly controls information relayed to cortex, which could have implications for encoding velocity signatures of textures.},

Using a chronic inflammatory pain model, we show that lesion of the PL contralateral but not ipsilateral to the inflamed paw attenuates hyperalgesia and anxiety-like behaviours in rats. Optogenetic activation of contralateral PL excitatory neurons exerts analgesic and anxiolytic effects in mice subjected to chronic pain, whereas inhibition is anxiogenic in naive mice. The intrinsic excitability of contralateral PL excitatory neurons is decreased in chronic pain rats; knocking down cyclin-dependent kinase 5 reverses this deactivation and alleviates behavioural impairments. Together, our findings provide novel insights into the role of PL excitatory neurons in the regulation of sensory and affective pain.},

Generally, it is assumed that efficient “pop-out” search involves mainly bottom-up processing, whereas inefficient search requires pronounced top-down control over visual processing. We used functional magnetic resonance imaging in behaving monkeys to explore the functional network involved in efficient visual search. As a pop-out target automatically attracts spatial attention, we attempted to determine the regions involved in feature selection independently of the spatial allocation of attention. Therefore, monkeys were trained to perform a search task in which they had to covertly detect the presence of a salient target among distractor objects. Three tasks were used to control, as much as possible, for the spatial allocation of attention. These control tasks were matched with the search task for visual input and manual responses. Pop-out search, when compared with the control tasks, activated 3 frontal regions: frontal eye field, area 45, and a posterior portion of area 46, in addition to small activation sites in lateral intraparietal area and inferotemporal area TE. Our results show that efficient search involves frontal regions as much as visual regions and in particular that ventral prefrontal area 45 is involved in top-down control during efficient search.},

These pathways are via the koniocellular layers of the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) and the medial portion of the inferior pulvinar (PIm). Both have been demonstrated in the adult nonhuman primate, but their influence during the maturation of the visual cortex is unknown. We used a combination of neural tracing and immunohistochemistry to follow the development of LGN and PIm inputs to area MT in the marmoset monkey. Our results revealed that the early maturation of area MT is likely due to the disynaptic retinopulvinar input and not the retinogeniculate input or the direct projection from V1. Furthermore, from soon after birth to adulthood, there was a dynamic shift in the ratio of input from these three structures to area MT, with an increasing dominance of the direct V1 afference.},

METHODOLOGY/PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Here we investigated the effects of rTMS to visual cortex on subjects’ ability to perform visual psychophysical tasks. Contrary to expectations of a visual deficit, we find that rTMS often improves the discrimination of visual features. For coarse orientation tasks, discrimination of a static stimulus improved consistently following theta-burst stimulation of the occipital lobe. Using a reaction-time task, we found that these improvements occurred throughout the visual field and lasted beyond one hour post-rTMS. Low-frequency (1 Hz) stimulation yielded similar improvements. In contrast, we did not find consistent effects of rTMS on performance in a fine orientation discrimination task. CONCLUSIONS/SIGNIFICANCE: Overall our results suggest that rTMS generally improves or has no effect on visual acuity, with the nature of the effect depending on the type of stimulation and the task. We interpret our results in the context of an ideal-observer model of visual perception.},

Here we report the effects, on the gain of LGN neurons, of differentially stimulating the extraclassical receptive field, with feedback from the striate cortex intact or inactivated in the marmoset monkey, Callithrix jacchus. A horizontally oriented grating of optimal size, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency was presented to the classical receptive field. The grating varied in contrast (range: 0-1) from trial to trial, and was presented alone, or surrounded by a grating of the same or orthogonal orientation, contained within either a larger annular field, or flanks oriented either horizontally or vertically. V1 was ablated to inactivate cortico-geniculate feedback. The maximum firing rate of LGN neurons was greater with V1 intact, but was reduced by visually stimulating beyond the classical receptive field. Large horizontal or vertical annular gratings were most effective in reducing the maximum firing rate of LGN neurons. Magnocellular neurons were most susceptible to this inhibition from beyond the classical receptive field. Extraclassical inhibition was less effective with V1 ablated. We conclude that inhibition from beyond the classical receptive field reduces the excitatory influence of V1 in the LGN. The net balance between cortico-geniculate excitation and inhibition from beyond the classical receptive field is one mechanism by which signals relayed from the retina to V1 are controlled.},

abstract = {Gain control is a salient feature of information processing throughout the visual system. Heeger (1991, 1992) described a mechanism that could underpin gain control in primary visual cortex (V1). According to this model, a neuron’s response is normalized by dividing its output by the sum of a population of neurons, which are selective for orientations covering a broad range. Gain control in this scheme is manifested as a change in the semisaturation constant (contrast gain) of a V1 neuron. Here we examine how flanking and annular gratings of the same or orthogonal orientation to that preferred by a neuron presented beyond the receptive field modulate gain in V1 neurons in anesthetized marmosets (Callithrix jacchus). To characterize how gain was modulated by surround stimuli, the Michaelis-Menten equation was fitted to response versus contrast functions obtained under each stimulus condition. The modulation of gain by surround stimuli was modelled best as a divisive reduction in response gain. Response gain varied with the orientation of surround stimuli, but was reduced most when the orientation of a large annular grating beyond the classical receptive field matched the preferred orientation of neurons. The strength of surround suppression did not vary significantly with retinal eccentricity or laminar distribution. In the marmoset, as in macaques (Angelucci et al., 2002a,b), gain control over the sort of distances reported here (up to 10 deg) may be mediated by feedback from extrastriate areas.},

abstract = {A suppressive surround modulates the responsiveness of cells in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN), but we know nothing of its spatial structure or the way in which it combines signals arising from different locations. It is generally assumed that suppressive signals are either uniformly distributed or balanced in opposing regions outside the receptive field. Here, we examine the spatial distribution and summation of suppressive signals outside the receptive field in extracellular recordings from 46 LGN cells in anesthetized marmosets. The receptive field of each cell was stimulated with a drifting sinusoidal grating of the preferred size and spatial and temporal frequency; we probed different positions in the suppressive surround with either a large half-annular grating or a small circular grating patch of the preferred spatial and temporal frequency. In many of the cells with a strong suppressive surround (29/46), the spatial distribution of suppression showed clear deviation from circular symmetry. In the majority of these of cells, suppressive signals were spatially asymmetrical or balanced in opposing areas outside the receptive field. A suppressive area was larger than the classical receptive field itself and spatial summation within and between these areas was nonlinear. There was no bias for suppression to arise from foveal or nasal retina where cone density is higher and no other sign of a systematic spatial organization to the suppressive surround. We conclude that nonclassical suppressive signals in LGN deviate from circular symmetry and are nonlinearly combined.},

abstract = {The respon of a neuron in striate cortex to an optimally configured visual stimulus is generally reduced when the stimulus is enlarged to encroach on a suppressive region that surrounds its classical receptive field (CRF). To characterize the mechanism that gives rise to this suppression, we measured its spatiotemporal tuning, its susceptibility to contrast adaptation, and its capacity for interocular transfer. Responses to an optimally configured grating confined to the CRF were strongly suppressed by annular surrounding gratings drifting at a wide range of temporal and spatial frequencies (including spatially uniform fields) that extended from well below to well above the range that drives most cortical neurons. Suppression from gratings capable of driving cortical CRFs was profoundly reduced by contrast adaptation and showed substantial interocular transfer. Suppression from stimuli that lay outside the spatiotemporal passband of most cortical CRFs was relatively stronger when the stimulus on the CRF was of low contrast, was generally insusceptible to contrast adaptation, and showed little interocular transfer. Our findings point to the existence of two mechanisms of surround suppression: one that is prominent when high-contrast stimuli drive the CRF, is orientation selective, has relatively sharp spatiotemporal tuning, is binocularly driven, and can be substantially desensitized by adaptation; the other is relatively more prominent when low-contrast stimuli drive the CRF, has very broad spatiotemporal tuning, is monocularly driven, and is insusceptible to adaptation. Its character suggests an origin in the input layers of primary visual cortex, or earlier.},

abstract = {The brain estimates visual motion by decoding the responses of populations of neurons. Extracting unbiased motion estimates from early visual cortical neurons is challenging because each neuron contributes an ambiguous (local) representation of the visual environment and inherently variable neural response. To mitigate these sources of noise, the brain can pool across large populations of neurons, pool the response of each neuron over time, or a combination of the two. Recent psychophysical and physiological work points to a flexible motion pooling system that arrives at different computational solutions over time and for different stimuli. Here we ask whether a single, likelihood-based computation can accommodate the flexible nature of spatiotemporal motion pooling in humans. We examined the contribution of different computations to human observers’ performance on two global visual motion discriminations tasks, one requiring the combination of motion directions over time and another requiring their combination in different relative proportions over space and time. Observers’ perceived direction of global motion was accurately predicted by a vector average readout of direction signals accumulated over time and a maximum likelihood readout of direction signals combined over space, consistent with the notion of a flexible motion pooling system that uses different computations over space and time. Additional simulations of observers’ performance with a population decoding model revealed a more parsimonious solution: flexible spatiotemporal pooling could be accommodated by a single computation that optimally pools motion signals across a population of neurons that accumulate local motion signals on their receptive fields at a fixed rate over time.},

A second important trend has been the realization that the processes of adaptation are themselves essential to how vision works, and thus are likely to operate at all levels. That is, “if it’s there, it adapts.” This has focused interest on the mechanisms of adaptation as the target rather than the probe. Together both approaches have led to an emerging insight of adaptation as a fundamental and ubiquitous coding strategy impacting all aspects of how we see.},

To explore potential nucleus-specific burst features, we compared the membrane properties of dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) and pulvinar nucleus relay neurons using in vitro whole-cell recording in juvenile and adult tree shrew (Tupaia) tissue slices. We injected current ramps of variable slope into neurons that were sufficiently hyperpolarized to de-inactivate T-type calcium channels. In a small percentage of juvenile pulvinar and dLGN neurons, an LTS could not be evoked. In the remaining juvenile neurons and in all adult dLGN neurons, a single LTS could be evoked by current ramps. However, in the adult pulvinar, current ramps evoked multiple LTSs in >70% of recorded neurons. Using immunohistochemistry, Western blot techniques, unbiased stereology, and confocal and electron microscopy, we found that pulvinar neurons expressed more T-type calcium channels (Ca(v) 3.2) and more small conductance potassium channels (SK2) than dLGN neurons and that the pulvinar nucleus contained a higher glia-to-neuron ratio than the dLGN. Hodgkin-Huxley-type compartmental models revealed that the distinct firing modes could be replicated by manipulating T-type calcium and SK2 channel density, distribution, and kinetics. The intrinsic properties of pulvinar neurons that promote burst firing in the adult may be relevant to the treatment of conditions that involve the adult onset of aberrant thalamocortical interactions.},

It is a ubiquitous and heterogeneous phenomenon, which takes place in different forms almost every time we view the world around us, such as when objects are occluded by other objects or when they fall behind the blind spot. Yet, to date, there is no clear framework for relating these various forms of perceptual filling-in. Similarly, whether these and other forms of filling-in share common mechanisms is not yet known. Here we present a new taxonomy to categorize the different forms of perceptual filling-in. We then examine experimental evidence for the processes involved in each type of perceptual filling-in. Finally, we use established theories of general surface perception to show how contextualizing filling-in using this framework broadens our understanding of the possible shared mechanisms underlying perceptual filling-in. In particular, we consider the importance of the presence of boundaries in determining the phenomenal experience of perceptual filling-in.},

Here, we developed a general approach for estimating layer-specific connectivity in cortical circuits and applied it to mouse motor cortex. From these data we computed a laminar presynaptic --> postsynaptic connectivity matrix, W(post,pre), revealing a complement of stereotypic pathways dominated by layer 2 outflow to deeper layers. Network modeling predicted, and experiments with disinhibited slices confirmed, that stimuli targeting upper, but not lower, cortical layers effectively evoked network-wide events. Thus, in motor cortex, descending excitation from a preamplifier-like network of upper-layer neurons drives output neurons in lower layers. Our analysis provides a quantitative wiring-diagram framework for further investigation of the excitatory networks mediating cortical mechanisms of motor control.},

abstract = {Spatial processing resolution of a particular object in the visual field can differ considerably due to eye movements. The same object will be represented with high acuity in the fovea but only coarsely in periphery. Herwig and Schneider (in press) proposed that the visual system counteracts such resolution differences by predicting, based on previous experience, how foveal objects will look in the periphery and vice versa. They demonstrated that previously learned transsaccadic associations between peripheral and foveal object information facilitate performance in visual search, irrespective of the correctness of these associations. False associations were learned by replacing the presaccadic object with a slightly different object during the saccade. Importantly, participants usually did not notice this object change. This raises the question of whether perception of object continuity is a critical factor in building transsaccadic associations. We disturbed object continuity during learning with a postsaccadic blank or a task-irrelevant shape change. Interestingly, visual search performance revealed that neither disruption of temporal object continuity (blank) nor disruption of spatial object continuity (shape change) impaired transsaccadic learning. Thus, transsaccadic learning seems to be a very robust default mechanism of the visual system that is probably related to the more general concept of action-effect learning.},

Here we show that the receptive fields of these cells differ in size and response latency but not at random. We have found that in the cat lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) the receptive field size and response latency of neighboring neurons are significantly correlated: the larger the receptive field, the faster the response to visual stimuli. This correlation is widespread in LGN. It is found in groups of cells belonging to the same type (e.g., Y cells), and of different types (i.e., X and Y), within a specific layer or across different layers. These results indicate that the inputs from the multiple geniculate afferents that converge onto a cortical cell (approximately 30) are likely to arrive in a sequence determined by the receptive field size of the geniculate afferents. Recent studies have shown that the peak of the spatial frequency tuning of a cortical cell shifts toward higher frequencies as the response progresses in time. Our results are consistent with the idea that these shifts in spatial frequency tuning arise from differences in the response time course of the thalamic inputs.},

Here, we review the ways in which an observer’s motor actions--locomotion, head and eye movements, and object manipulation--affect his or her perception and representation of three-dimensional objects and space.

year = {2007}, 
abstract = {Despite popular belief that the primary function of the thalamus is to “gate” sensory inputs by state, few studies have attempted to directly characterize the efficacy of such gating in the awake, behaving animal. I measured the efficacy of retinogeniculate transmission in the awake cat by taking advantage of the fact that many neurons in the lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) are dominated by a single retinal input, and that this input produces a distinct event known as the S-potential. Retinal input failed to produce an LGN action potential half of the time. However, success or failure was powerfully tied to the recency of the S-potential. Short intervals tend to be successful and long intervals unsuccessful. For four of 12 neurons, the probability that a given S-potential could cause a spike exceeded 90% if that S-potential was preceded by an S-potential within the previous 10 ms (100 Hz). Whereas this temporal influence on efficacy has been demonstrated extensively in anesthetized animals, wakefulness is different in several ways. Overall efficacy is better in wakefulness than in anesthesia, the durations of facilitating effects are briefer in wakefulness, efficacy of long intervals is superior in wakefulness, and the temporal dependence can be briefly disrupted by altering background illumination. The last two observations may be particularly significant. Increased success at long intervals in wakefulness provides additional evidence that the spike code of the anesthetized animal is not the spike code of the awake animal. Altering retinogeniculate efficacy by altering visual conditions undermines the influence inter-S-potential interval might have in determining efficacy in the real world. Finally, S-potential amplitude, duration, and even slope are dynamic and systematic within wakefulness; providing further support that the S-potential is the extracellular signature of the retinal EPSP.},

abstract = {Providing the critical link between the retina and visual cortex, the well-studied lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) has stood out as a structure in search of a function exceeding the mundane ‘relay’. For many mammals, it is structurally impressive: Exquisite lamination, sophisticated microcircuits, and blending of multiple inputs suggest some fundamental transform. This impression is bolstered by the fact that numerically, the retina accounts for a small fraction of its input. Despite such promise, the extent to which an LGN neuron separates itself from its retinal brethren has proven difficult to appreciate. Here, I argue that whereas retinogeniculate coupling is strong, what occurs in the LGN is judicious pruning of a retinal drive by nonretinal inputs. These nonretinal inputs reshape a receptive field that under the right conditions departs significantly from its retinal drive, even if transiently. I first review design features of the LGN and follow with evidence for 10 putative functions. Only two of these tend to surface in textbooks: parsing retinal axons by eye and functional group and gating by state. Among the remaining putative functions, implementation of the principle of graceful degradation and temporal decorrelation are at least as interesting but much less promoted. The retina solves formidable problems imposed by physics to yield multiple efficient and sensitive representations of the world. The LGN applies context, increasing content, and gates several of these representations. Even if the basic concentric receptive field remains, information transmitted for each LGN spike relative to each retinal spike is measurably increased.},

The neural mechanisms of surround suppression in our simulations operate via (A) enhancement of inhibition, (B) reduction of excitation, or (C) action of both simultaneously. Mechanisms (B) and (C) are substantially more prevalent than (A). We observe, on average, a growth in the spatial summation extent of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs for low-contrast stimuli.

abstract = {The output of individual neurons is dependent on both synaptic and intrinsic membrane properties. While it is clear that the response of an individual neuron can be facilitated or inhibited based on the summation of its constituent synaptic inputs, it is not clear whether subthreshold activity, (e.g. synaptic “noise”--fluctuations that do not change the mean membrane potential) also serve a function in the control of neuronal output. Here we studied this by making whole-cell patch-clamp recordings from 29 mouse thalamocortical relay (TC) neurons. For each neuron we measured neuronal gain in response to either injection of current noise, or activation of the metabotropic glutamate receptor-mediated cortical feedback network (synaptic noise). As expected, injection of current noise via the recording pipette induces shifts in neuronal gain that are dependent on the amplitude of current noise, such that larger shifts in gain are observed in response to larger amplitude noise injections. Importantly we show that shifts in neuronal gain are also dependent on the intrinsic sensitivity of the neuron tested, such that the gain of intrinsically sensitive neurons is attenuated divisively in response to current noise, while the gain of insensitive neurons is facilitated multiplicatively by injection of current noise- effectively normalizing the output of the dLGN as a whole. In contrast, when the cortical feedback network was activated, only multiplicative gain changes were observed. These network activation-dependent changes were associated with reductions in the slow afterhyperpolarization (sAHP), and were mediated at least in part, by T-type calcium channels. Together, this suggests that TC neurons have the machinery necessary to compute multiple output solutions to a given set of stimuli depending on the current level of network stimulation.},

abstract = {Neurons in sensory systems respond to stimuli within their receptive fields, but the magnitude of the response depends on specific stimulus features. In the rodent whisker system, the response magnitude to the deflection of a particular whisker is, in most cells, dependent on the direction of deflection. Here we use in vivo intracellular recordings from thalamorecipient neurons in layers 3 and 4 of the rat barrel cortex to elucidate the dynamics of the synaptic inputs underlying direction selectivity. We show that cells are direction selective despite a broadly tuned excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input. Selectivity emerges from a direction-dependent temporal shift of excitation relative to inhibition. For preferred direction deflections, excitation precedes inhibition, but as the direction diverges from the preferred, this separation decreases. Our results illustrate a mechanism by which the timing of the synaptic inputs, and not their relative peak amplitudes, primarily determine feature selectivity.},

abstract = {A pattern of light striking the retina of an alert observer is normally readily perceived. While a handful of conditions exist in which even salient visual stimuli can be rendered invisible, the mechanisms underlying such suppression remain poorly understood. Here, we describe experiments using a novel stimulation sequence that gives rise to the sudden and reliable subjective disappearance of a wide range of visual patterns. We found that a parafoveal target immediately vanished from perception following the abrupt onset of a surrounding texture. The probability of disappearance was influenced by the ocular configuration of the target and surround, as well as their spatial separation. In addition, suppression was critically dependent upon several hundred milliseconds of stimulus-specific adaptation. These findings demonstrate that the all-or-none disappearance of a salient visual target, which is reminiscent of a high-level selection process, is inextricably linked to topographic stimulus representations, presumably in the early visual cortex.},

We found that neurons in the dorsal and ventral pulvinar, but not the LGN, showed changes in spiking rate according to stimulus visibility. Passive viewing control sessions showed such modulation to be independent of the monkeys’ active report. Perceptual suppression was also accompanied by a marked drop in low-frequency power (9-30 Hz) of the local field potential (LFP) throughout the visual thalamus, but this modulation was not observed during passive viewing. Our findings demonstrate that visual responses of pulvinar neurons reflect the perceptual awareness of a stimulus, while those of LGN neurons do not.},

Nonetheless, despite their prescience, these specific contributions to the connectionist case have been almost entirely ignored. Eventually, Bain came to doubt the practicality of his own arguments and, in so doing, he seems to have ensured that his ideas concerning neural groupings exerted little or no influence on the subsequent course of theorizing in this area.},

This information was position invariant, correlated with perceptual discrimination accuracy and was found only in foveal, but not peripheral, retinotopic cortex. Our data cannot be explained by differential eye movements, activation from the fixation cross, or spillover activation from peripheral retinotopic cortex or from lateral occipital complex. Instead, our findings indicate that position-invariant object information from higher cortical areas is fed back to foveal retinotopic cortex, enhancing task performance.},

abstract = {The large Spanish wildcat, Felis silvestris tartessia, has retained features of the Pleistocene ancestor of the modern domestic cat, F. catus. To gauge the direction and magnitude of short-term evolutionary change in this lineage, we have compared the retina, the optic nerve, and the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) of Spanish wildcats and their domestic relatives. Retinas of the two species have the same area. However, densities of cone photoreceptors are higher in wildcat--over 100% higher in the area centralis--whereas rod densities are as high, or higher, in the domestic lineage. Densities of retinal ganglion cells are typically 20-100% higher across the wildcat retina, and the total ganglion cell population is nearly 70% higher than in the domestic cat. These differences are confined to the populations of beta and gamma retinal ganglion cells. In contrast, the population of alpha cells is almost precisely the same in both species. The wildcat LGN is much larger than that of the domestic cat and contains approximately 50% more neurons. However, cell size does not differ appreciably in either the retina or LGN of these species. The differences in total numbers of ganglion cells and LGN neurons correspond neatly to the overall decline in brain size in the domestic lineage and to allometric predictions based on average species differences in body size. We suggest that an increase in the severity of naturally occurring cell death is the most plausible mechanism that can account for the rapid evolutionary reduction in cell populations in this feline lineage.},

abstract = {The thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN) is a shell of GABAergic neurons that surrounds the dorsal thalamus. Previous work has shown that TRN neurons send GABAergic projections to thalamocortical (TC) cells to form reciprocal, closed-loop circuits. This has led to the hypothesis that the TRN is responsible for oscillatory phenomena, such as sleep spindles and absence seizures. However, there is emerging evidence that open-loop circuits are also found between TRN and TC cells. The implications of open-loop configurations are not yet known, particularly when they include time-dependent nonlinearities in TC cells such as low-threshold bursting. We hypothesized that low-threshold bursting in an open-loop circuit could be a mechanism by which the TRN could paradoxically enhance TC activation, and that enhancement would depend on the relative timing of TRN vs. TC cell stimulation. To test this, we modeled small circuits containing TC neurons, TRN neurons, and layer 4 thalamorecipient cells in both open- and closed-loop configurations. We found that open-loop TRN stimulation, rather than universally depressing TC activation, increased cortical output across a broad parameter space, modified the filter properties of TC neurons, and altered the mutual information between input and output in a frequency-dependent and T-type calcium channel-dependent manner. Therefore, an open-loop model of TRN-TC interactions, rather than suppressing transmission through the thalamus, creates a tunable filter whose properties may be modified by outside influences onto the TRN. These simulations make experimentally testable predictions about the potential role for the TRN for flexible enhancement of cortical activation.},

The application of dynamical modelling has provided valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying such nonlinear wave phenomena in several domains. Wave propagation can also be perceived as sweeping waves of visibility that occur when the two eyes view radically different stimuli. Termed binocular rivalry, these fluctuating states of perceptual dominance and suppression are thought to provide a window into the neural dynamics that underlie conscious visual awareness. Here we introduce a technique to measure the speed of rivalry dominance waves propagating around a large, essentially one-dimensional annulus. When mapped onto visual cortex, propagation speed is independent of eccentricity. Propagation speed doubles when waves travel along continuous contours, thus demonstrating effects of collinear facilitation. A neural model with reciprocal inhibition between two layers of units provides a quantitative explanation of dominance wave propagation in terms of disinhibition. Dominance waves provide a new tool for investigating fundamental cortical dynamics Type: Journal Article Language: eng},

Two were X-cells and two were Y-cells. Each had electrophysiological properties appropriate for its X- Or Y-cell class, and each also had an axon that projected into the optic radiation, indicative of a geniculocortical relay cell. Representative samples from about 10% of each neuron’s entire dendritic arbor (proximal and distal) were taken to obtain an estimate of the types and distributions of synapses contacting these arbors. One X-cell had a cytoplasmic laminar body, but there were no other significant cytological differences seen among the neurons. Common to each of the neurons were the following synaptic features: (i) retinal terminals (r.l.p.) were mostly or entirely restricted to proximal dendrites or dendritic appendages (less than 100 microns from the soma). These terminals constituted about 15-25% of the synapses on the proximal dendrites. (ii) Terminals with flattened or pleomorphic synaptic vesicles (f. terminals) were predominant on the proximal dendrites (30-55% of the total synapses for that region) and were mainly located near the retinal terminals. A smaller percentage (10-20%) were also distributed onto the distal dendrites. (iii) Small terminals with round synaptic vesicles (r.s.d.), many presumably having a cortical origin, predominated (60-80%) on distal dendrites (greater than 100 microns), but also formed a large proportion (40-70%) of the synapses on the intermediate (50-150 microns) dendrites. Total synaptic contacts for one X-cell and one Y-cell were estimated at about 4000 and 5000, respectively. The major fine structural differences observed between X- and Y-cells were almost entirely related to the retinal afferents. First, the retinal synapses for X-cells were mostly made on to dendritic appendages (spines, etc.), whereas Y-cells had most of their retinal synapses onto the shafts of primary and proximal secondary dendrites (that is, near branch points. Second, the retinal terminals that contacted X-cell dendrites nearly always formed triadic arrangements that included nearby f. terminals, but those on Y-cells rarely did so. Finally, the main type of f. terminals associated with X-cells were morphologically different from most of those associated with the Y-cells, and this also related directly to the triadic arrangements; that is, f. terminals in the triadic arrangements were morphologically distinguishable from f. terminals that did not participate in triadic arrangements.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS)},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) is the thalamic region responsible for transmitting retina signals to cortex. Brainstem pathways to this nucleus have been described in several species and are believed to control the retinocortical pathway depending on the state of the animal (awake, asleep, drowsy, etc.). The purpose of this study was to determine all of the subcortical sources of afferents to the dLGN in a higher primate, the macaque monkey, whose visual system is similar to that of humans. METHODS: Injections of horseradish peroxidase (HRP), with or without conjugation to wheat germ agglutinin, were made into the dLGNs of seven macaque monkeys, followed by perfusion, brain sectioning, and analyses of neurons in the brainstem, thalamus, and hypothalamus that contained the retrogradely transported marker. RESULTS: The reticular nucleus of the thalamus, pedunculopontine nucleus, parabigeminal nucleus, pretectal nucleus of the optic tract, superior colliculus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and tuberomammillary region of the hypothalamus contained many retrogradely labeled neurons ipsilateral to the injections. In the contralateral brainstem, HRP-labeled cells were found only in the pedunculopontine nucleus, nucleus of the optic tract, and dorsal raphe nucleus. The number of labeled neurons on the contralateral side was about one-half of that in corresponding ipsilateral nuclei. The locus coeruleus contained no labeled neurons in four of the macaques that had injections limited to the dLGN. CONCLUSION: There are seven subcortical regions that send afferents to the dLGNs of macaque monkeys. Except for the locus coeruleus, these are the same as observed for other species, such as the cat and rat, and indicate the possible sources of subcortical control over the dLGNs of humans.},

abstract = {How the brain selects appropriate sensory inputs and suppresses distractors is unknown. Given the well-established role of the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in executive function, its interactions with sensory cortical areas during attention have been hypothesized to control sensory selection. To test this idea and, more generally, dissect the circuits underlying sensory selection, we developed a cross-modal divided-attention task in mice that allowed genetic access to this cognitive process. By optogenetically perturbing PFC function in a temporally precise window, the ability of mice to select appropriately between conflicting visual and auditory stimuli was diminished. Equivalent sensory thalamocortical manipulations showed that behaviour was causally dependent on PFC interactions with the sensory thalamus, not sensory cortex. Consistent with this notion, we found neurons of the visual thalamic reticular nucleus (visTRN) to exhibit PFC-dependent changes in firing rate predictive of the modality selected. visTRN activity was causal to performance as confirmed by bidirectional optogenetic manipulations of this subnetwork. Using a combination of electrophysiology and intracellular chloride photometry, we demonstrated that visTRN dynamically controls visual thalamic gain through feedforward inhibition. Our experiments introduce a new subcortical model of sensory selection, in which the PFC biases thalamic reticular subnetworks to control thalamic sensory gain, selecting appropriate inputs for further processing.},

These neurons are separated based on the laminar specificity of axonal and dendritic arbors into two classes, class I and class II, and into several types within these classes. Class I neurons project axons heavily and predominantly to layer 4C, whereas class II neurons have axonal projections primarily to layers other than 4C. Only 16 of the 58 neurons in our sample (28%) project to the white matter. Class I projection neurons are found at the top and bottom of layer 6, suggesting that they project to the lateral geniculate nucleus, whereas class II projection neurons are located in the middle of layer 6, suggesting that they project to the claustrum. The different types of class I neurons are distinguished from one another based on the sublaminar specificity of their axonal and dendritic arbors within layer 4, where they are biased toward compartments dominated by input from different functional streams. They are also distinct in their distributions within the depth of layer 6. The distinctive characteristics of the neuronal types we have identified suggest that each receives input from different sources and projects to a set of targets that is functionally appropriate. Thus, each type is likely to contribute uniquely to computations within V1 and extrinsically},

We measured the estimated onset time of actions that subjects either executed themselves or observed being executed by someone else or by a machine. In three experiments, the estimates of the machine actions always differed from those of self- and other-generated actions, whereas the latter two were indistinguishable. Our results are consistent with the view that intentions are attributed to others but not to machines.

abstract = {When a flash of light is presented in physical alignment with a moving object, the flash is perceived to lag behind the position of the object. This phenomenon, known as the flash-lag effect, has been of particular interest to vision scientists because of the challenge it presents to understanding how the visual system generates perceptions of objects in motion. Although various explanations have been offered, the significance of this effect remains a matter of debate. Here, we show that: (i) contrary to previous reports based on limited data, the flash-lag effect is an increasing nonlinear function of image speed; and (ii) this function is accurately predicted by the frequency of occurrence of image speeds generated by the perspective transformation of moving objects. These results support the conclusion that perceptions of the relative position of a moving object are determined by accumulated experience with image speeds, in this way allowing for visual behavior in response to real-world sources whose speeds and positions cannot be perceived directly.},

To date, it remains unresolved where and how in the visual system different stages of figure-ground segregation emerge. Neural correlates of figure border detection have consistently been found in early visual cortex (V1/V2). However, areas V1/V2 have also been frequently associated with later stages of figure-ground segregation (such as border ownership or surface segregation). To causally link activity in early visual cortex to different stages of figure-ground segregation, we briefly disrupted activity in areas V1/V2 at various moments in time using transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Prior to stimulation we presented stimuli that made it possible to differentiate between figure border detection and surface segregation. We concurrently recorded electroencephalographic (EEG) signals to examine how neural correlates of figure-ground segregation were affected by TMS. Results show that disruption of V1/V2 in an early time window (96-119 msec) affected detection of figure stimuli and affected neural correlates of figure border detection, border ownership, and surface segregation. TMS applied in a relatively late time window (236-259 msec) selectively deteriorated performance associated with surface segregation. We conclude that areas V1/V2 are not only essential in an early stage of figure-ground segregation when figure borders are detected, but subsequently causally contribute to more sophisticated stages of figure-ground segregation such as surface segregation.},

Results show that both V1/V2 and higher-level visual area LO are critically involved in perceptual completion. However, these areas seem to be involved in an inverse hierarchical fashion, in which the critical time window for V1/V2 follows that for LO. These results are in line with the growing evidence that feedback to V1/V2 contributes to perceptual completion.},

abstract = {Characterizing the responsiveness of thalamic neurons is crucial to understanding the flow of sensory information. Typically, thalamocortil neurons possess two distinct firing modes. At depolarized membrane potentials, thalamic cells fire single action potentials and faithfully relay synaptic inputs to the cortex. At hyperpolarized potentials, the activation of T-type calcium channels promotes burst firing, and the transfer is less accurate. Our results suggest that this duality no longer holds if synaptic background activity is taken into account. By injecting stochastic conductances into guinea-pig thalamocortical neurons in slices, we show that the transfer function of these neurons is strongly influenced by conductance noise. The combination of synaptic noise with intrinsic properties gives a global responsiveness that is more linear, mixing single-spike and burst responses at all membrane potentials. Because in thalamic neurons, background synaptic input originates mainly from cortex, these results support a determinant role of corticothalamic feedback during sensory information processing.},

The two modes represented cells generally associated with the lagged and nonlagged classes of Mastronarde (1987a,b), and this was confirmed by their responses to step and sine-modulated spots in their field centers. The intermediate cells, rather than appearing to constitute a separate group, smoothly filled the region between the obviously lagged and nonlagged cells in every respect. These conclusions are limited to X-cells although the data from a much smaller population of Y-cells conform to the same scheme. We conclude that lagged and nonlagged cells represent the modes of a continuous and very broad distribution of temporal responses in the cat LGN.},

Accumulating evidence suggests that this selective neuronal modulation relies on rhythmic synchronization at local and long-range spatial scales: attention selectively synchronizes the rhythmic responses of those neurons that are tuned to the spatial and featural attributes of the attended sensory input. The strength of synchronization is thereby functionally related to perceptual accuracy and behavioural efficiency. Complementing this synchronization at a local level, attention has recently been demonstrated to regulate which locally synchronized neuronal groups phase-synchronize their rhythmic activity across long-nge connections. These results point to a general computational role for selective synchronization in dynamically controlling which neurons communicate information about sensory inputs effectively.},

abstract = {Our capacity to process and respond behaviourally to multiple incoming stimuli is very limited. To optimize the use of this limited capacity, attentional mechanisms give priority to behaviourally relevant stimuli at the expense of irrelevant distractors. In visual areas, attended stimuli induce enhanced responses and an improved synchronization of rhythmic neuronal activity in the gamma frequency band (40-70 Hz). Both effects probably improve the neuronal signalling of attended stimuli within and among brain areas. Attention also results in improved behavioural performance and shortened reaction times. However, it is not known how reaction times are related to either response strength or gamma-band synchronization in visual areas. Here we show that behavioural response times to a stimulus change can be predicted specifically by the degree of gamma-band synchronization among those neurons in monkey visual area V4 that are activated by the behaviourally relevant stimulus. When there are two visual stimuli and monkeys have to detect a change in one stimulus while ignoring the other, their reactions are fastest when the relevant stimulus induces strong gamma-band synchronization before and after the change in stimulus. This enhanced gamma-band synchronization is also followed by shorter neuronal response latencies on the fast trials. Conversely, the monkeys’ reactions are slowest when gamma-band synchronization is high in response to the irrelevant distractor. Thus, enhanced neuronal gamma-band synchronization and shortened neuronal response latencies to an attended stimulus seem to have direct effects on visually triggered behaviour, reflecting an early neuronal correlate of efficient visuo-motor integration.},

abstract = {Selective attention is the top-down mechanism to allocate neuronal processing resources to the most relevant subset of the information provided by an organism’s sensors. Attentional selection of a spatial location modulates the spatial-tuning characteristics (i.e., the receptive fields of neurons in macaque visual cortex). These tuning changes include a shift of receptive field centers toward the focus of attention and a narrowing of the receptive field when the attentional focus is directed into the receptive field. Here, we report that when attention is directed into versus of receptive fields of neurons in the middle temporal visual area (area MT), the magnitude of the shift of the spatial-tuning functions is positively correlated with a narrowing of spatial tuning around the attentional focus. By developing and applying a general attentional gain model, we show that these nonmultiplicative attentional modulations of basic neuronal-tuning characteristics could be a direct consequence of a spatially distributed multiplicative interaction of a bell-shaped attentional spotlight with the spatially fined-grained sensory inputs of MT neurons. Additionally, the model lets us estimate the spatial spread of the attentional top-down signal impinging on visual cortex. Consistent with psychophysical reports, the estimated size of the “spotlight of attention” indicates a coarse spatial resolution of attention. These results illustrate how spatially specific nonmultiplicative attentional changes of neuronal-tuning functions can be the result of multiplicative gain modulation affecting sensory neurons in a widely distributed region in cortical space.},

Injections of [3H]leucine were also made into the dorsolateral striate cortex of a Macaca speciosa for comparison. The results indicated that in Saimiri the dorsolateral prestriate cortex is precisely and reciprocally connected with the striate and peristriate cortex, and with the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus, including the middle temporal area (MT). The dorsolateral striate area is precisely and reciprocally connected with the prestriate and MT area, but does not project to the perstriate cortex as in the case of the macaque. At each target site, the radioactively labelled terminal fields are distributed in a distinctly columnar fashion, with labelled columns (120-480 microm in diameter, commonly 240 microm) interdigitating with sparsely labelled or unlabelled columns of lesser widths. The HRP-labelled neurons invariably exist within the radioactively labelled columns. For all of the cortical areas examined except area 17, lamina IV is the principal ‘receptive’ layer for associational fibers, while layers III and II, as well as V and VI within the same column, receive progressively less input. As for area 17, associational fibers from the prestriate cortex terminate mainly within lamina I, with laminae II, III, V and VI receiving decreasing amounts of input. The present results indicate that the major visual cortical areas are interconnected in precise, topographical and reciprocal fashion. The columnar arrangement is found to be the basis of both extra- and intercortical connections.},

The receptive field of an auditory neuron was characterized by five parameters: the best frequency, minimum threshold, bandwidth, size of receptive field, and average spike number. We found that focal thalamic stimulation changed the parametric values characterizing the recorded collicular receptive fields toward those characterizing the stimulated thalamic receptive fields. Cortical inactivation with muscimol prevented the development of the collicular plasticity induced by focal thalamic stimulation.

abstract = {Cross-adaptation is widely used to probe whether different stimuli share common neural mechanisms. For example, that adaptation to second-order stimuli usually produces little aftereffect on first-order stimuli has been interpreted as reflecting their separate processing. However, such results appear to contradict the cue-invariant responses of many visual cells. We tested the novel hypothesis that the null aftereffect arises from the large difference in the backgrounds of first- and second-order stimuli. We created second-order faces with happy and sad facial expressions specified solely by local directions of moving random dots on a static-dot background, without any luminance-defined form cues. As expected, adaptation to such a second-order face did not produce a facial-expression aftereffect on the first-order faces. However, consistent with our hypothesis, simply adding static random dots to the first-order faces to render their backgrounds more similar to that of the adapting motion face led to a significant aftereffect. This background similarity effect also occurred between different types of first-order stimuli: real-face adaptation transferred to cartoon faces only when noise with correlation statistics of real faces or natural images was added to the cartoon faces. These findings suggest the following: (1) statistical similarities between the featureless backgrounds of the adapting and test stimuli can influence aftereffects, as in contingent adaptation; (2) weak or null cross-adaptation aftereffects should be interpreted with caution; and (3) luminance- and motion-direction-defined forms, and local features and global statistics, converge in the representation of faces.},

abstract = {Visual perception fluctuates across repeated presentations of the same near-threshold stimulus. These perceptual fluctuations have often been attributed to baseline shifts--i.e., ongoing modulations of neuronal activity in visual areas--driven by top-down attention. Using magnetoencephalography, we directly tested whether ongoing attentional modulations could fully account for the perceptual impact of prestimulus activity on a subsequent seen-unseen decision. We found that prestimulus gamma-band fluctuations in lateral occipital areas (LO) predicted visual awareness, but did not reflect the focus of spatial attention. Moreover, these prestimulus signals influenced the decision outcome independently from the strength of the following visual response, suggesting that baseline shifts alone could not explain their perceptual impact. Using a straightforward decision-making model based on the accumulation of sensory evidence over time, we show that prestimulus gamma-band fluctuations in LO behave as a decision bias at stimulus onset, irrespectively of subsequent stimulus processing. In contrast, spatial attention suppressed prestimulus alpha-band signals in the same region, and produced a sustained baseline shift that also predicted the outcome of the seen-unseen decision. Together, our results indicate that prestimulus fluctuations in visual areas can influence the conscious detection of an upcoming stimulus via two distinct mechanisms: an attention-driven baseline shift in the alpha range, and a decision bias in the gamma range.},

abstract = {Everyday vision requires robustness to a myriad of environmental factors that degrade stimuli. Foreground clutter can occlude objects of interest, and complex lighting and shadows can decrease the contrast of items. How does the brain recognize visual objects despite these low-quality inputs? On the basis of predictions from a model of object recognition that contains excitatory feedback, we hypothesized that recurrent processing would promote robust recognition when objects were degraded by strengthening bottom-up signals that were weakened because of occlusion and contrast reduction. To test this hypothesis, we used backward masking to interrupt the processing of partially occluded and contrast reduced images during a categorization experiment. As predicted by the model, we found significant interactions between the mask and occlusion and the mask and contrast, such that the recognition of heavily degraded stimuli was differentially impaired by masking. The model provided a close fit of these results in an isomorphic version of the experiment with identical stimuli. The model also provided an intuitive explanation of the interactions between the mask and degradations, indicating that masking interfered specifically with the extensive recurrent processing necessary to amplify and resolve highly degraded inputs, whereas less degraded inputs did not require much amplification and could be rapidly resolved, making them less susceptible to masking. Together, the results of the experiment and the accompanying model simulations illustrate the limits of feedforward vision and suggest that object recognition is better characterized as a highly interactive, dynamic process that depends on the coordination of multiple brain areas.},

abstract = {Standard models of the visual object recognition pathway hold that a largely feedforward process from the retina through inferotemporal cortex leads to object identification. A subsequent feedback process originating in frontoparietal areas through reciprocal connections to striate cortex provides attentional support to salient or behaviorally-relevant features. Here, we review mounting evidence that feedback signals also originate within extrastriate regions and begin during the initial feedforward process. This feedback process is temporally dissociable from attention and provides important functions such as grouping, associational reinforcement, and filling-in of features. Local feedback signals operating concurrently with feedforward processing are important for object identification in noisy real-world situations, particularly when objects are partially occluded, unclear, or otherwise ambiguous. Altogether, the dissociation of early and late feedback processes presented here expands on current models of object identification, and suggests a dual role for descending feedback projections.},

The results show that each and all cones are contacted by at least one member of any given type of bipolar cell (not considering genuine blue cones). Consequently, each cone feeds its light signals into a minimum of 10 different bipolar cells. Parallel processing of an image projected onto the retina, therefore, starts at the first synapse of the retina, the cone pedicle. The quantitative analysis suggests that our proposed catalog of 11 cone bipolar cells and one rod bipolar cell is complete, and all major bipolar cell types of the mouse retina appear to have been discovered.},

abstract = {Visually driven single-unit activity was recorded in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) of the anaesthetized cat while inactivating or stimulating the corticofugal feedback from area 17/18 by means of cortical cooling or application of GABA (inactivation), or application of glutamate or quisqualate (Glu, Quis; stimulation) to layer VI.
 Manipulations of the corticofugal feedback primarily affected the multimodal interspike interval pattern previously reported to be present in the tonic component of visual responses elicited by spot-like stimuli.
 Sixty-three per cent of all neurons could be influenced, and temporally localized interspike interval distributions were measured which commonly consisted of one fundamentalinterval peak (leftmost peak) and integer multiples thereof (higher orderpeaks). During blockade of the corticofugal feedback, interspike intervals were redistributed into the higher order peaks in about 70 % of the cases, accompanied by a reduced mean firing rate. During stimulation the reverse effect occurred in 69 % of cases.
 Increased synchronization of the EEG (increased power in the δ-wave range, 1-4 Hz) had an effect similar to cortex inactivation. The specificity of corticofugal effects was verified by consideration of these EEG effects and by dLGN double recordings with one dLGN cell topographically matched with the cortical inactivation/activation site and the second cell outside this area. Clear effects due to manipulation of the corticofugal feedback were found only for the matched dLGN site.
 In addition we observed that the peaks of the interval distributions were narrower during active corticofugal feedback, such that the temporal dispersion of the signal transmission to the cortex was reduced.
 The mechanisms underlying this effect were further analysed in a biophysically realistic model demonstrating that the timing of the spikes in the dLGN is improved as soon as the cortical feedback is active. The high degree of convergence/divergence between neurons along the closed feedback loop thereby leads to a temporal averaging effect which reduces the interval dispersion and also introduces synchronization between dLGN cells.
 Such a mechanism may thus counteract the deterioration of spike timing accuracy which would otherwise occur as a consequence of synaptic noise and other uncorrelated sources of activity at a given neuron.},

Accordingly the neuronal activity patterns in the visual thalamus and cortex show a pronounced dynamic behavior which reenters the circuitry such that the actual cell responses are also guided by the activation history of the network. Thus, spatial and temporal aspects of visual receptive fields change not only by means of the actual visual stimulation hut also as a consequence of the state of the network. In this short review we summarize the different aspects which can influence the temporal firing patterns of cells in the visual thalamus (lateral geniculate nucleus, LGN) mainly by demonstrating how their inter-spike interval distributions will change. We then show that these firing patterns are able to change the spatial shape of receptive fields in the visual cortex (see Fig. 12 for a summary diagram). Finally, by means of a biophysical model, we will argue that the observed changes could serve to adjust the temporal and spatial resolution within the primary visual pathway to the different demands for information processing in an attentive as compared to a non-attentive state.},

We compare the behaviour of dLGN cells during spontaneous changes of the frequency contents of the electroencephalograph (EEG) (which are mainly related to a changing brain stem influence), with those that are obtained when experimentally silencing the corticothalamic feedback. The spatial and temporal response properties of dLGN cells are compared during these two conditions, and we report that the neurons behave similarly during a synchronized EEG state and during inactive corticothalamic feedback. In both situations, dLGN cells are rather phasic and their remaining tonic activity is temporally dispersed, indicating a hyperpolarizing effect. By means of a novel method, we were able to chronically eliminate a large proportion of the corticothalamic projection neurons from the otherwise intact cortex. In this condition, we found that cortical cells also lose their EEG specific response differences but, in this instance, probably due to a facilitatory (depolarizing) plasticity reaction of the remaining network.},

In the middle temporal area (area MT), a cortical visual area involved in the analysis of retinal motion in primates, this opponency appears in the form of a region outside the classical receptive field (CRF) that in itself gives no response but suppresses responses to motion evoked within the CRF. This antagonistic motion surround has been described as very large and symmetrically arrayed around the CRF. On the basis of this view, the primary function of the surround has long been thought to consist of simple figure-ground segregation based on movement. We have made use of small stimulus patches to map the form and extent of the surround and find evidence that the surround inhibition of many MT cells is in fact confined to restricted regions on one side or on opposite sides of the CRF. Such regions endow MT cells with the ability to make local-to-local motion comparisons, capable of extracting more complex features from the visual environment, and as such, may be better viewed as intrinsic parts of the receptive field, rather than as separate entities responsible for local-to-global comparisons.},

Both tests showed that the angular surround distribution was non-uniform in the majority of these neurons. In half the neurons, the antagonistic surround was asymmetric, and arose from a single region on one side of the excitatory receptive field (ERF). In another quarter of the sample the surround was bilaterally symmetric, and arose from a pair of regions on opposite sides of the ERF. Only the remaining 20% showed a circularly symmetric surround distribution. These three groups differed in their laminar distribution. The SMT showed that, radially, the surround antagonism reached a maximum, on average, at 1.5 times the ERF radius. Detailed comparisons of the spatial relationships of excitatory and inhibitory regions of the RF components shows that non-homogeneity of the surround influence appears to be an intrinsic property of the surround.

Speed-dependent changes usually entailed diminished position dependence of surround influence, consequent to reduced surround effect at the position producing maximum inhibition.

But current techniques have inherent variations in the timing between stimulus activation and stimulus display of up to tens of milliseconds, thereby introducing significant errors when response time or the latency of neural responses is measured. This article presents a novel yet easy-to-implement solution for improving resolution in the synchronizing of stimulus activation and stimulus display. Unlike traditional methods in which the stimulus onset is set as the time at which the routine for displaying the stimulus is called, this approach uses DirectX to monitor the scan line of CRTs and sets the stimulus onset to the time at which the scan line arrives at the position where the stimulus is to be drawn. This approach removes the uncertainty involved in having a time delay between the activation of the display routine and the actual time at which the display occurs, improving the accuracy of response time and latency period measurements to within 200 microsec. With a specially developed driver, this solution can generate a trigger signal synchronized precisely with the stimulus onset in all popular Windows systems (including Windows 2000/XP).},

abstract = {Tuning curves were recorded with patch electrodes from the inferior colliculus (IC) of awake bats to evaluate the tuning of the inputs to IC neurons, reflected in their synaptic tuning, compared with the tuning of their outputs, expressed in their discharge tuning. A number of unexpected features were revealed with whole-cell recordings. Among these was that most neurons responded to tones with inhibition and/or subthreshold excitation over a surprisingly broad frequency range. The synaptic tuning in many cells was at least 1.5-2.0 octaves wide and, on average, was more than twice as wide as the frequency range that evoked discharges even after inhibition was blocked. In most cells, tones evoked complex synaptic response configurations that varied with frequency, suggesting that these cells were not innervated by congruent excitatory and inhibitory projections. Synaptic tuning was not only wide but was also diverse, in which some cells were dominated by excitation (n = 20), others were dominated by excitation with sideband inhibition (n = 21), but most were dominated by inhibition with little evidence of excitation (n = 31). Another unexpected finding was that some cells responded with inhibition to the onset and offset of tones over a wide frequency range, in which the patterns of synaptic responses changed markedly with frequency. These cells never fired to tones at 50 dB sound pressure level but fired to frequency-modulated sweeps at that intensity and were directionally selective. Thus, the features revealed by whole-cell recordings show that the processing in many IC cells results from inputs spectrally broader and more complex than previously believed.},

We mapped multi-unit activity and LFP visual responses with sparse-noise at several cortical sites simultaneously. The cortical magnification factor near the recording sites was precisely estimated by track reconstruction. The new method combined experimental measurements together with a model of signal summation to obtain the cortical spread of the LFP. This new method could be extended to cortical areas that have topographic maps such as S1 or A1, and to cortical areas without functional columnar maps, such as rodent visual cortex. In macaque V1, the LFP was the sum of signals from a very local region, the radius of which was on average 250 microm. The LFP’s cortical spread varied across cortical layers, reaching a minimum value of 120 microm in layer 4B. An important functional consequence of the small cortical spread of the LFP is that the visual field maps of LFP and MUA recorded at a single electrode site were very similar. The similar spatial scale of the visual responses, the restricted cortical spread, and their laminar variation led to new insights about the sources and possible applications of the LFP.},

However, the magnitude of the contribution of suppression to tuning selectivity is not yet determined. We use orientation selectivity in macaque primary visual cortex, V1, as an archetypal example of cortical feature selectivity and develop a method to estimate the magnitude of the contribution of suppression to orientation selectivity. The results show that untuned suppression, one form of cortical suppression, decreases the orthogonal-to-preferred response ratio (O/P ratio) of V1 cells from an average of 0.38 to 0.26. Untuned suppression has an especially large effect on orientation selectivity for highly selective cells (O/P < 0.2). Therefore, untuned suppression is crucial for the generation of highly orientation-selective cells in V1 cortex.},

abstract = {Precise action potential timing is crucial in sensory acuity and motor control. Convergence of many synaptic inputs is thought to provide a means of decreasing spike-timing variability (”jitter”), but its effectiveness has never been tested in real neurons. We used the dynamic-clamp technique in mouse auditory brain stem slices to examine how convergence controls spike timing. We tested the roles of several synaptic properties that are influenced by ongoing activity in vivo: the number of active inputs (N), their total synaptic conductance (G(tot)), and their timing, which can resemble an alpha or a Gaussian distribution. Jitter was reduced most with large N, up to a factor of over 20. Variability in N is likely to occur in vivo, but this added little jitter. Jitter reduction also depended on the timing of inputs: alpha-distributed inputs were more effective than Gaussian-distributed inputs. Furthermore, the two distributions differed in their sensitivity to synaptic conductance: for Gaussian-distributed inputs, jitter was most reduced when G(tot) was 2-3 times threshold, whereas alpha-distributed inputs showed continued jitter reduction with higher G(tot). However, very high G(tot) caused the postsynaptic cell to fire multiple times, particularly when the input jitter outlasted the cell’s refractory period, which interfered with jitter reduction. G(tot) also greatly affected the response latency, which could influence downstream computations. Changes in G(tot) are likely to arise in vivo through activity-dependent changes in synaptic strength. High rates of postsynaptic activity increased the number of synaptic inputs required to evoke a postsynaptic response. Despite this, jitter was still effectively reduced, particularly in cases when this increased threshold eliminated secondary spikes. Thus these studies provide insight into how specific features of converging inputs control spike timing.},

abstract = {There is considerable controversy over the existence of orientation and direction sensitivity in lateral geniculate nucleus (LGN) neurons. Claims for the existence of these properties often were based upon data from cells tested well beyond their peak spatial frequencies. The goals of the present study were to examine the degree of orientation and direction sensitivity of LGN cells when tested at their peak spatial and temporal frequencies and to compare the tuning properties of these subcortical neurons with those of visual cortex. For this investigation, we used conventional extracellular recording to study orientation and direction sensitivities of owl monkey LGN cells by stimulating cells with drifting sinusoidal gratings at peak temporal frequencies, peak or higher spatial frequencies, and moderate contrast. A total of 110 LGN cells (32 koniocellular cells, 34 magnocellular cells, and 44 parvocellular cells) with eccentricities ranging from 2.6 deg to 27.5 deg were examined. Using the peak spatial and temporal frequencies for each cell, 41.8% of the LGN cells were found to be sensitive to orientation and 19.1% were direction sensitive. The degree of bias for orientation and direction did not vary with eccentricity or with cell class. Orientation sensitivity did, however, increase, and in some cases orientation preferences changed, at higher spatial frequencies. Increasing spatial frequency had no consistent effect on direction sensitivity. Compared to cortical cell orientation tuning, the prevalence and strength of LGN cell orientation and direction sensitivity are weak. Nevertheless, the high percentage of LGN cells sensitive to orientation even at peak spatial and temporal frequencies reinforces the view that subcortical biases could, in combination with activity-dependent cortical mechanisms and/or cortical inhibitory mechanisms, account for the much narrower orientation and direction tuning seen in visual cortex.},

Details of the relationship between center and surround often can be used to predict how cells respond to visual stimuli. Models of the receptive-field organization and center/surround relationships also are useful when comparing cell classes. In the present study, we used the difference-of-Gaussians (DOG) model to quantitatively examine and compare the receptive-field center/surround organization of koniocellular (K), magnocellular (M), and parvocellular (P) LGN cells of owl monkeys. We obtained estimates of receptive-field center size (r(c)) and center sensitivity (K(c)), and surround size (r(s)), and surround sensitivity (K(s)) from 62 K, M, and P LGN cells by fitting their spatial-frequency responses with a DOG function (Rodieck, 1965; Croner & Kaplan, 1995). The DOG function not only accounted for the responses of P and M cells, but also provided a good description of K-cell responses. We found that at matched eccentricities of less than 15 deg, K cells had the largest r(c) and r(s) among the three cell classes. K cells also had the lowest K(c) and K(s). Center and surround sizes tended to increase with retinal eccentricity for all three cell classes, but K cells showed a more variable pattern. There was an inverse relationship between sensitivity and size for both the receptive-field center and surround in all three cell classes. The surround/center volume ratio remained similar across cell classes. We conclude that K, M, and P LGN cell classes differ in the details of their receptive-field structure, but share common principles of center/surround organization.},

By using optical imaging of intrinsic signals, we compared the maps of orientation and spatial frequency (SF) preference between central (0-3 degrees) and paracentral (4-8 degrees) V1 in the prosimian bush baby (Otolemur garnetti). No differences related to eccentricity were found for orientation selectivity or magnitude between central and paracentral V1. We found, however, that cardinal orientations were overrepresented in central but not in paracentral V1 and that isoorientation domain size tended to be smaller in the central representation. We demonstrated that spatial frequency was represented continuously across V1, and that the map of SF preference exhibited eccentricity-dependent variations, with more territory devoted to higher SFs in central than in paracentral V1. Although there were no spatial relationships between orientation domains and cytochrome oxidase (CO) blobs or interblobs, CO blobs tended to prefer lower SFs than interblobs. Taken together with previous research, our data indicate that functional domains in V1 show eccentricity-related differences in organization and also support the idea that different maps (with or without specific geometrical relationships) are organized for adequate coverage of each feature in visual space},

By varying the relative spatial phase (RSP) between a central grating presented in the CRF and a surround grating in the ERF, we studied the contextual modulation in V1 neurons of alert monkeys (Macaca mulata). Results from two monkeys show that most of the V1 neurons with suppressive ERF are sensitive to the RSP, and the degree of sensitivity is strongly dependent on the strength of ERF suppression. This sensitivity is maximal when the RSP is generated at or near CRF/ERF boundary, but is observed over the entire ERF. Interestingly, the suppressive effect of the surround grating can be largely abolished by inserting a narrow gap between the center and surround gratings or by a phase displacement between them corresponding to <10% of the CRF diameter. These properties of V1 neurons may serve important perceptual functions.},

abstract = {The primate visual system is composed of multiple, functionally specialized cortical areas. The functional diversity among areas is thought to reflect different contributions from early parallel visual pathways to the area V1 neurons providing input to “higher” cortical areas. The M pathway is believed to provide information about motion and contrast, via layer 4B of V1, to dorsal visual areas. The P pathway is believed to provide information about shape and color, via layer 2/3 of V1, to ventral visual areas, with specialized contributions from cytochrome-oxidase (CO) blob versus interblob neurons. However, the detailed anatomical relationships between the M and P pathways and the neurons in V1 that provide input to higher extrastriate cortical areas are poorly understood. To study these relationships, spiny stellate neurons in the M- and P-recipient layers of V1, 4Calpha and 4Cbeta, respectively, were intracellularly labeled, and their axonal and dendritic arbors were reconstructed. We find that neurons with dendrites in upper layer 4Calpha project axons to layer 4B and CO blobs in layer 2/3, thus relaying M input to these regions. Other neurons in lower layer 4Calpha provide M input to interblobs. These cells have either (1) dendrites restricted to lower layer 4Calpha and axons specifically targeting layer 2/3 interblobs, or (2) dendrites in lower 4Calpha and 4Cbeta and axons targeting blobs and interblobs. P-recipient layer 4Cbeta neurons have dense axonal arbors in both blobs and interblobs but not layer 4B. Quantitative analyses reveal that 4Calpha cells provide approximately five times more synapses than 4Cbeta cells to layer 4B, whereas 4Cbeta cells provide five times more synapses than 4Calpha cells to layer 2/3. These observations imply that M input is dominant in layer 4B. In layer 2/3, both blobs and interblobs receive M and P input, but the P input is dominant, and M input to interblobs derives exclusively from a subpopulation of M afferents that targets lower 4Calpha, not from afferents targeting only upper 4Calpha (cf. Blasdel and Lund, 1983). We speculate that the M and P pathways to interblobs are “X-like” linear systems, whereas blobs also receive nonlinear “Y-like” M input.},

abstract = {Horizontal connections in the primary visual cortex have been hypothesized to play a number of computational roles: association field for contour completion, surface interpolation, surround suppression, and saliency computation. Here, we argue that horizontal connections might also serve a critical role for computing the appropriate codes for image representation. That the early visual cortex or V1 explicitly represents the image we perceive has been a common assumption in computational theories of efficient coding (Olshausen and Field (1996)), yet such a framework for understanding the circuitry in V1 has not been seriously entertained in the neurophysiological community. In fact, a number of recent fMRI and neurophysiological studies cast doubt on the neural validity of such an isomorphic representation (Cornelissen et al., 2006; von der Heydt et al., 2003). In this study, we investigated, neurophysiologically, how V1 neurons respond to uniform color surfaces and show that spiking activities of neurons can be decomposed into three components: a bottom-up feedforward input, an articulation of color tuning and a contextual modulation signal that is inversely proportional to the distance away from the bounding contrast border. We demonstrate through computational simulations that the behaviors of a model for image representation are consistent with many aspects of our neural observations. We conclude that the hypothesis of isomorphic representation of images in V1 remains viable and this hypothesis suggests an additional new interpretation of the functional roles of horizontal connections in the primary visual cortex.},

abstract = {The dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus (dLGN) is essential for the transfer of visual information from the retina to visual cortex, and inhibitory mechanisms can play a critical in regulating such information transfer. Nitric oxide (NO) is an atypical neuromodulator that is released in gaseous form and can alter neural activity without direct synaptic connections. Nitric oxide synthase (NOS), an essential enzyme for NO production, is localized in thalamic inhibitory neurons and cholinergic brain stem neurons that innervate the thalamus, although NO-mediated effects on thalamic inhibitory activity remain unknown. We investigated NO effects on inhibitory activity in dLGN using an in vitro slice preparation. The NO donor, SNAP, selectively potentiated the frequency, but not amplitude, of spontaneous inhibitory postsynaptic currents (sIPSCs) in thalamocortical relay neurons. This increase also persisted in tetrodotoxin (TTX), consistent with an increase in GABA release from presynaptic terminals. The SNAP-mediated actions were attenuated not only by the NO scavenger carboxy-PTIO but also by the guanylyl cyclase inhibitor ODQ. The endogenous NO precursor l-arginine produced actions similar to those of SNAP on sIPSC activity and these l-arginine-mediated actions were attenuated by the NOS inhibitor L-NMMA acetate. The SNAP-mediated increase in sIPSC activity was observed in both dLGN and ventrobasal thalamic nucleus (VB) neurons. Considering the lack of interneurons in rodent VB, the NO-mediated actions likely involve an increase in the output of axon terminals of thalamic reticular nucleus neurons. Our results indicate that NO upregulates thalamic inhibitory activity and thus these actions likely influence sensory information transfer through thalamocortical circuits.},

However, the current implementation of CFS in many studies examining processing outside of awareness has several drawbacks that may be improved upon for future studies using CFS. In this paper, we address some of those shortcomings, particularly ones that affect the assessment of unawareness during CFS, and ones to do with the use of “visible” conditions that are often included as a comparison to a CFS condition. We also discuss potential biases in stimulus processing as a result of spatial attention and feature-selective suppression. We suggest practical guidelines that minimize the effects of those limitations in using CFS to study visual processing outside of awareness.},

To address this issue, we recruited prelinguistic infants (5- to 7-mo-olds) to measure changes in brain activity in relation to categorical color differences by using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). We presented two sets of geometric figures to infants: One set altered in color between green and blue, and the other set altered between two different shades of green. We found a significant increase in hemodynamic responses during the between-category alternations, but not during the within-category alternations. These differences in hemodynamic response based on categorical relationship were observed only in the bilateral occipitotemporal regions, and not in the occipital region. We confirmed that categorical color differences yield behavioral differences in infants. We also observed comparable hemodynamic responses to categorical color differences in adults. The present study provided the first evidence, to our knowledge, that colors of different categories are represented differently in the visual cortex of prelinguistic infants, which implies that color categories may develop independently before language acquisition.},

Two experiments are described which addressed this hypothesis by parametrically varying the duration of the stimuli that are bejudged. Changes in internal clock speed predict chronostasis effects proportional to stimulus duration. No evidence for proportionality was found. Two further experiments assessed the appropriateness of the control conditions employed. Results indicated that the chronostasis effect is constant across a wide range of stimulus durations and does not reflect the pattern of visual stimulation experienced during a saccade, suggesting that arousal is not critical. Instead, alternative processes, such as one affecting the onset of timing (i.e., the time of internal clock switch closure) are implicated.

Each retinal ganglion cell diverges to connect to a small group of geniculate cells and each geniculate cell receives input from a small number of retinal ganglion cells. Consistent with the high specificity of the connections, geniculate cells sharing input from the same retinal afferent are thought to have very similar receptive fields. However, the magnitude of the receptive-field mismatches, which has not been systematically measured across the different cell types in dLGN, seems to be in contradiction with the functional anatomy of the Y visual pathway: Y retinal afferents in the cat diverge into two geniculate layers (A and C) that have Y geniculate cells (Y(A) and Y(C)) with different receptive-field sizes, response latencies, nonlinearity of spatial summation, and contrast sensitivity. To better understand the functional consequences of retinogeniculate divergence, we recorded from pairs of geniculate cells that shared input from a common retinal afferent across layers and within the same layer in dLGN. We found that nearly all cell pairs that shared retinal input across layers had Y-type receptive fields of the same sign (i.e., both on-center) that overlapped by >70%, but frequently differed in size and response latency. The receptive-field mismatches were relatively small in value (receptive-field size ratio <5; difference in peak response <5 ms), but were robustly correlated with the strength of the synchronous firing generated by the shared retinal connections (R(2) = 0.75). On average, the percentage of geniculate spikes that could be attributed to shared retinal inputs was about 10% for all cell-pair combinations studied. These results are used to provide new estimates of retinogeniculate divergence for different cell classes.},

Responses of ON and OFF retinal and thalamic neurons are approximately equal in magnitude (Kr√ºger and Fischer, 1975; Kremers et al., 1993), but psychophysical studies have shown that humans detect light decrements (black) better and faster than increments (white) (Blackwell, 1946; Short, 1966; Krauskopf, 1980; Whittle, 1986; Bowen et al., 1989; Chan and Tyler, 1992; Kontsevich and Tyler, 1999; Chubb and Nam, 2000; Dannemiller and Stephens, 2001). From recordings of single-cell activity in the macaque monkey’s primary visual cortex (V1), we found that black-dominant neurons substantially outnumbered white-dominant neurons in the corticocortical output layers 2/3, but the numbers of black- and white-dominant neurons were nearly equal in the thalamocortical input layer 4c. These results strongly suggest that the black-over-white preference is generated or greatly amplified in V1. The predominance of OFF neurons in layers 2/3 of V1, which provide visual input to higher cortical areas, may explain why human subjects detect black more easily than white. Furthermore, our results agree with human EEG and fMRI findings that V1 responses to decrements are stronger than to increments, though the OFF/ON imbalance we found in layers 2/3 of macaque V1 is much larger than in the whole V1 population in the human V1 experiments (Zemon et al., 1988, 1995; Olman et al., 2008).},

abstract = {When presented with simple stimuli like bars and gratings, adjacent neurons in striate cortex exhibit shared selectivity for multiple stimulus dimensions, such as orientation, direction, and spatial frequency. This has led to the idea that local averaging of neuronal responses provides a more reliable representation of stimulus properties. However, when stimulated with complex, time-varying natural scenes (i.e., movies), striate neurons exhibit highly sparse responses. This raises the question of how much response heterogeneity the local population exhibits when stimulated with movies, and how it varies with separation distance between cells. We investigated this question by simultanously recording the responses of groups of neurons in cat striate cortex to the repeated presentation of movies using silicon probes in a multi-tetrode configuration. We found, first, that the responses of striate neurons to movies are brief (tens of milliseconds), decorrelated, and exhibit high population sparseness. Second, we found that adjacent neurons differed significantly in their peak firing rates even when they responded to the same frames of a movie. Third, pairs of adjacent neurons recorded on the same tetrodes exhibited as much heterogeneity in their responses as pairs recorded by different tetrodes. These findings demonstrate that complex natural scenes evoke highly heterogeneous responses within local populations, suggesting that response redundancy in a cortical column is substantially lower than previously thought.},

Specifically, sudden movements are often detected before full recognition of the camouflaged animal is made, suggesting that initial processing of motion precedes the recognition of motion-defined contours or shapes. What are the neuronal mechanisms underlying this initial processing of camouflaged motion in the primate visual brain? We investigated this question using intrinsic-signal optical imaging of macaque V1, V2, and V4, along with computer simulations of the neural population responses. We found that camouflaged motion at low speed was processed as a direction signal by both direction– and orientation–selective neurons, whereas at high speed camouflaged motion was encoded as a motion–streak signal primarily by orientation-selective neurons. No population responses were found to be invariant to the camouflaged contours. These results suggest that the initial processing of camouflaged motion at low and high speeds is encoded as direction and motion-streak signals in primate early visual cortices. These processes are consistent with a spatio-temporal filter mechanism that provides for fast processing of motion signals, prior to full recognition of camouflage-breaking animals.},

abstract = {Abstract:	A central question in vision is how the cortex integrates local cues to form global representations along the visual hierarchy. Orientation is a key feature of a given contour and the generation of orientation selectivity offers a great window to explore the neural mechanisms underlying visual information integration. The orientation selectivity in V4 is believed to be inherited through successive convergent projections from V1 and V2 neurons with the same orientation preference. However, for a stimulus like the zebra crossing, what happens when the global orientation and the local orientations are not matched? We investigated this question of orientation integration by simultaneous optical imaging of V1, V2, and V4 and subsequent single-unit recordings in anesthetized and awake macaques, respectively. We found that for a given orientation stimulus, the orientation domains in V1, V2, and V4 all exhibited the same orientation preference to the stimulus. However, for a global orientation stimulus defined by different local orientations, only V4 encoded the global orientation whiles V1 and V2 signaled the local orientations, suggesting V4 can integrate feed-forward inputs from V1/V2 with different orientation preferences. These population results were later confirmed by electrophysiological recordings as 85% neurons in V4, in contrast to only 28% neurons in V2 and few neurons in V1, encoded the global orientation of such stimuli. Our results demonstrate that V4 orientation domain integrates feed-forward inputs not only from V1/V2 orientation columns with the same preference, but also from those with different preferences. Our findings thus reveal the orientation integration from local into global across different visual cortices.},

Here we tested whether inhibitory cortical neurons in rat visual cortex might also be connected with fine-scale specificity. Using paired intracellular recordings and cross-correlation analyses of photostimulation-evoked synaptic currents, we found that fast-spiking interneurons preferentially connected to neighboring pyramids that provided them with reciprocal excitation. Furthermore, they shared common fine-scale excitatory input with neighboring pyramidal neurons only when the two cells were reciprocally connected, and not when there was no connection or a one-way, inhibitory-to-excitatory connection. Adapting inhibitory neurons shared little or no common input with neighboring pyramids, regardless of their direct connectivity. We conclude that inhibitory connections and also excitatory connections to inhibitory neurons can both be precise on a fine scale. Furthermore, fine-scale specificity depends on the type of inhibitory neuron and on direct connectivity between neighboring pyramidal-inhibitory neuron pairs.},

abstract = {Although the visual system has been extensively investigated, an integrated account of the spatiotemporal dynamics of long-range signal propagation along the human visual pathways is not completely known or validated. In this work, we used dynamic causal modeling approach to provide insights into the underlying neural circuit dynamics of pattern reversal visual-evoked potentials extracted from concurrent EEG-fMRI data. A recurrent forward-backward connectivity model, consisting of multiple interacting brain regions identified by EEG source localization aided by fMRI spatial priors, best accounted for the data dynamics. Sources were first identified in the thalamic area, primary visual cortex, as well as higher cortical areas along the ventral and dorsal visual processing streams. Consistent with hierarchical early visual processing, the model disclosed and quantified the neural temporal dynamics across the identified activity sources. This signal propagation is dominated by a feedforward process, but we also found weaker effective feedback connectivity. Using effective connectivity analysis, the optimal dynamic causal modeling revealed enhanced connectivity along the dorsal pathway but slightly suppressed connectivity along the ventral pathway. A bias was also found in favor of the right hemisphere consistent with functional attentional asymmetry. This study validates, for the first time, the long-range signal propagation timing in the human visual pathways. A similar modeling approach can potentially be used to understand other cognitive processes and dysfunctions in signal propagation in neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders. Significance statement: An integrated account of long-range visual signal propagation in the human brain is currently incomplete. Using computational neural modeling on our acquired concurrent EEG-fMRI data under a visual evoked task, we found not only a substantial forward propagation toward “higher-order” brain regions but also a weaker backward propagation. Asymmetry in our model’s long-range connectivity accounted for the various observed activity biases. Importantly, the model disclosed the timing of signal propagation across these connectivity pathways and validates, for the first time, long-range signal propagation in the human visual system. A similar modeling approach could be used to identify neural pathways for other cognitive processes and their dysfunctions in brain disorders.},

abstract = {Microsaccades are small-amplitude (typically <1°), ballistic eye movements that occur when attempting to fixate gaze. Initially thought to be generated randomly, it has recently been established that microsaccades are influenced by sensory stimuli, attentional processes, and certain cognitive states. Whether decision processes influence microsaccades, however, is unknown. Here, we adapted two classic economic tasks to examine whether microsaccades reflect evolving saccade decisions. Volitional saccade choices of monkey and human subjects provided a measure of the subjective value of targets. Importantly, analyses occurred during a period of complete darkness to minimize the known influence of sensory and attentional processes on microsaccades. As the time of saccadic choice approached, microsaccade direction became the following: 1) biased toward targets as a function of their subjective value and 2) predictive of upcoming, voluntary choice. Our results indicate that microsaccade direction is influenced by and is a reliable tell of evolving saccade decisions. Our results are consistent with dynamic decision processes within the midbrain superior colliculus; that is, microsaccade direction is influenced by the transition of activity toward caudal saccade regions associated with high saccade value and/or future saccade choice.},

A series of experiments demonstrate the involvement of the direct corticocortical feedback pathway, providing temporally precise and spatially targeted modulation of network dynamics. Cortically mediated changes in network state significantly impact sensory coding, with activated states increasing the reliability of responses to complex stimuli. By influencing network state, corticocortical communication from motor cortex may ensure that during active exploration the relevant sensory region is primed for enhanced sensory discrimination.},

abstract = {A retinal ganglion cell receptive field comprises an excitatory center and an inhibitory surround. The surround has two components: one driven by horizontal cells at the first synaptic layer, and one driven by amacrine cells at the second synaptic layer. Here, we characterized how amacrine cells inhibit the center response of ON- and OFF-center Y-type ganglion cells in the in vitro guinea pig retina. A high spatial frequency grating (4-5 cyc mm-1), beyond the spatial resolution of horizontal cells, drifted in the ganglion cell receptive field periphery to stimulate amacrine cells. The peripheral grating suppressed the ganglion cell spiking response to a central spot. Suppression of spiking was strongest and observed most consistently in OFF cells. In intracellular recordings, the grating suppressed the subthreshold membrane potential in two ways: a reduced slope (gain) of the stimulus-response curve by ~20-30% and, in OFF cells, a tonic ~1 mV hyperpolarization. In voltage-clamp, the grating increased an inhibitory conductance in all cells and simultaneously decreased an excitatory conductance in OFF cells. To determine if center response inhibition was presynaptic or postsynaptic (shunting), we measured center response gain under voltage-clamp and current-clamp conditions. Under both conditions, the peripheral grating reduced center response gain similarly. This result suggests that reduced gain in the ganglion cell subthreshold center response reflects inhibition of presynaptic bipolar terminals. Thus, amacrine cells suppressed ganglion cell center response gain primarily by inhibiting bipolar cell glutamate release.},

To address this question, we varied the duration of initial exposure to visual objects and then measured functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) signal and behavioral performance during a subsequent repeated presentation of these objects. We report a novel ‘rise-and-fall’ pattern relating exposure duration and the corresponding magnitude of fMRI cortical signal. Compared with novel objects, repeated objects elicited maximal cortical response reduction when initially presented for 250 ms. Counter-intuitively, initially seeing an object for a longer duration significantly reduced the magnitude of this effect. This ‘rise-and-fall’ pattern was also evident for the corresponding behavioral priming. To account for these findings, we propose that the earlier interval of an exposure to a visual stimulus results in a fine-tuning of the cortical response, while additional exposure promotes selection of a subset of key features for continued representation. These two independent mechanisms complement each other in shaping object representations with experience.},

We recorded the activity of these neurons during a behavioral task in which two monkeys were required to discriminate and remember visual motion presented in the ipsilateral hemifield. During the task, the monkeys viewed two stimuli, sample and test, separated by a brief delay and reported whether they contained motion in the same or in opposite directions. Fifty to 70% of MT neurons were activated by the motion stimuli presented in the ipsilateral hemifield at locations far removed from their classical receptive fields. These responses were in the form of excitation or suppression and were delayed relative to conventional MT responses. Both excitatory and suppressive responses were direction selective, but the nature and the time course of their directionality differed from the conventional excitatory responses recorded with stimuli in the RF. Direction selectivity of the excitatory remote response was transient and early, whereas the suppressive response developed later and persisted after stimulus offset. The presence or absence of these unusual responses on error trials, as well as their magnitude, was affected by the behavioral significance of stimuli used in the task. We hypothesize that these responses represent top-down signals from brain region(s) accessing information about stimuli in the entire visual field and about the behavioral state of the animal. The recruitment of neurons in the opposite hemisphere during processing of behaviorally relevant visual signals reveals a mechanism by which sensory processing can be affected by cognitive task demands.},

Specifically, we describe a traveling wave of local field potential (LFP) activity in cortical area V4 of macaque monkeys that is triggered by the execution of saccadic eye movements. These waves sweep across the V4 retinotopic map, following a consistent path from the foveal to the peripheral representations of space; their amplitudes correlate with the direction and size of each saccade. Moreover, these waves are associated with a reorganization of the postsaccadic neuronal firing patterns, which follow a similar retinotopic progression, potentially prioritizing the processing of behaviorally relevant stimuli.},

Participants with stronger fronto-posterior functional connectivity displayed greater disruptive effects.

One type, the opposed movement complex and opposed movement hypercomplex cells, responded to two edges at a given orientation moving towards or away from each other within the receptive fields. These cells were driven either monocularly or binocularly, but when binocularly driven the cells responded in an identical manner to stimulation of each eye, thus suggesting that such cells must receive a double, and opposed, input from each eye. The other type of cell, always binocularly driven, responded to movement in opposite directions on the two retinas, thus suggesting that such cells must receive diametrically opposite connexions from the two eyes.3. Long penetrations made to study the manner in which such cells were grouped together in the cortex revealed that they were arranged in small groups or clusters, separated from each other by the common directionally selective cells so prominently present in this area.

There was a large variation in the size of the receptive fields of individual cells, even in a single penetration. Some cells, with the central parts of their receptive fields located from between 1 and 5 degrees from the centre of gaze had receptive fields averaging about 10 degrees x 10 degrees or even larger. Other cells with central receptive fields had much smaller field sizes.3. Two main types of neurones were encountered, with subdivisions within each type. The first type responded to movement irrespective of form. These could be subdivided into neurones which responded to movement in any direction within the receptive field and neurones which responded to movement in one direction only (directionally selective neurones). Another type of cell was responsive to both contour and movement, much like the complex and lower order hypercomplex cells. Almost all such neurones were directionally selective.4. In oblique penetrations through this cortical region, there tended frequently to be an orderly shift in preferred directions of motion, thus suggesting the possibility of a columnar organization for movement.5. Combined anatomical (degeneration) and electrophysiological experiments showed that these types of neurones are found in those regions of the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus receiving a direct projection from area 17.},

As one of the most intensively studied parts of the visual brain, it has yielded many insights into how the visual brain operates. Among these are: the diversity of signals that determine the functional capacities of a visual area; the relationship between single cell activity in a specialized visual area and perception of, and preference for, attributes of a visual stimulus; the multiple asynchronous inputs into, and outputs from, an area as well as the multiple operations that it undertakes asynchronously; the relationship between activity at given, specialized, areas of the visual brain and conscious awareness; and the mechanisms used to “bind” signals from one area with those from another, with a different specialization, to give us our unitary perception of the visual world. Hence V5 is, in a sense, a microcosm of the visual world and its study gives important insights into how the whole visual brain is organized-anatomically, functionally and perceptually.},

In human imaging experiments, we compared the brain activity produced in the so-called ‘kinetic occipital’ area (’KO’) when humans perceive shapes generated from kinetic boundaries or from equiluminant colors. ‘KO’ was activated whenever subjects perceived shapes, no matter how they were derived; it is therefore not specialized for the processing of kinetic contours. The application of independent component analysis (ICA) to imaging data obtained when subjects viewed 22 min of an action movie showed that the time course of activity in ‘KO’ correlates better with activity in area V3 than with activity in two adjacent areas, V5 and LO. We thus consider ‘KO’ to be part of the V3 family of areas, and use the terminology of Smith et al. (J Neurosci 18:3816-3830, 1998), to refer to it as area V3B. Recordings from orientation-selective cells in the macaque V3 complex show that the great majority have the same orientational specificity when tested with oriented lines generated from kinetic stimuli or from luminance differences. We conclude that there is no present evidence for a visual area specialized for the processing of kinetic contours in the primate visual brain.},

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and psychophysics to quantitatively compare these physiological and perceptual effects. Observers performed a contrast discrimination task on a contrast-reversing sinusoidal target grating. The target was either presented in isolation or embedded in a high-contrast surround. While observers performed the task, we also measured fMRI responses as a function of target contrast, both with and without a surround. We found that the surround substantially increased the psychophysical thresholds while reducing fMRI responses. The two data sets were compared, on the basis of the assumption that a fixed response difference is required for correct discrimination, and we found that the psychophysics accounted for 96.5% of the variance in the measured V1 responses. The suppression in visual areas V2 and V3 was stronger, too strong to agree with psychophysics. The good quantitative agreement between psychophysical thresholds and V1 responses suggests V1 as a plausible candidate for mediating surround masking},

Many neurons in mammalian visual cortex show orientation preference to both types of boundaries, but it is uncertain how they contribute to perceptual orientation cue-invariance at the neuronal population level. Using optical imaging in cat A 18, we observed highly similar orientation preference maps to first-order and a variety of second-order visual stimuli. Thus the neuronal representation of coarse-scale boundary orientation appears to be invariant to the characteristics (including local orientation) of the fine-scale textures by which those boundaries are defined. A common feature of second-order visual stimuli is that modulation shifts their Fourier energy for boundary orientation to the higher spatial frequencies of their constituent textures - our results suggest a common neural mechanism (demodulation) mediating visual processing of many kinds of texture boundary. The similarity between orientation maps to different stimuli implies that second-order responsive neurons are homogeneously distributed across the cortical surface. Such homogeneously cue-invariant orientation representation could provide a neural substrate for perceptual form-cue invariance, and reflect an optimal organization for encoding orientation information in natural scenes},

This cue invariance is also manifested in similar orientation maps to these stimuli, but in V1/A17 the illusory contour maps appear reversed. We hypothesized that this map reversal depends upon the spatial frequencies of the inducers in the illusory contours, relative to the spatial selectivities of these brain areas. We employed intrinsic signal optical imaging to measure orientation maps in cat A17/18 to illusory contours with inducers at spatial frequencies from 0.15 to 1.6 cpd. A17 illusory contour maps were indeed reversed compared with grating-driven maps for inducer spatial frequencies <1.3 cpd, whereas A18 maps were invariant. Simulations based on known neurophysiology demonstrated that map reversal can arise from linear filtering, and map invariance can be explained by a nonlinear (filter-rectify-filter) mechanism. The simulation also correctly predicted that A17 could show invariant maps when the inducer spatial frequency is sufficiently high (1.6 cpd), and that A18 maps could reverse at lower inducer frequencies (0.18 cpd). Thus, the map reversal or invariance to illusory contours depends critically on the relationship of the inducer spatial frequencies to the spatial filtering properties of neurons in each brain area.},

The study of such fluctuations could potentially provide insight into the brain’s functional organization. In this article, we begin by presenting an overview of the strategies used to explore intrinsic neuronal activity. Considering the possibility that intrinsic signaling accounts for a large proportion of brain activity, we then examine whether the functional architecture of intrinsic activity is altered in neurological and psychiatric diseases. We also review a clinical application of brain mapping, in which intrinsic activity is employed for the preoperative localization of functional brain networks in patients undergoing neurosurgery. To end the article, we explore some of the basic science pursuits that have been undertaken to further understand the physiology behind intrinsic activity as imaged with BOLD fMRI.},

By utilizing the intrinsic property of a CANN, we use a projection method to reduce the dimensionality of the network dynamics significantly. The simplified dynamics allows us to elucidate the effects of feedback modulation analytically. We find that positive feedback enhances the stability of the network state, leading to an improved population decoding performance, whereas negative feedback increases the mobility of the network state, inducing spontaneously moving bumps. For strong, negative feedback interaction, the network response to a moving stimulus can lead the actual stimulus position, achieving an anticipative behavior. The biological implications of these findings are discussed. The simulation results agree well with our theoretical analysis.},

NpHR allows either knockout of single action potentials, or sustained blockade of spiking. NpHR is compatible with ChR2, the previous optical excitation technology we have described, in that the two opposing probes operate at similar light powers but with well-separated action spectra. NpHR, like ChR2, functions in mammals without exogenous cofactors, and the two probes can be integrated with calcium imaging in mammalian brain tissue for bidirectional optical modulation and readout of neural activity. Likewise, NpHR and ChR2 can be targeted together to Caenorhabditis elegans muscle and cholinergic motor neurons to control locomotion bidirectionally. NpHR and ChR2 form a complete system for multimodal, high-speed, genetically targeted, all-optical interrogation of living neural circuits.},

However, it is not yet understood how complex images are represented across these maps. In this study, we ask whether a linear filter model can explain how cortical spatial frequency domains are activated by complex images. The model assumes that the response to a stimulus at any point on the cortical surface can be predicted by its individual orientation, spatial frequency, and temporal frequency tuning curves. To test this model, we imaged the pattern of activity within cat area 17 in response to stimuli composed of multiple spatial frequencies. Consistent with the predictions of the model, the stimuli activated low and high spatial frequency domains differently: at low stimulus drift speeds, both domains were strongly activated, but activity fell off in high spatial frequency domains as drift speed increased. To determine whether the filter model quantitatively predicted the activity patterns, we measured the spatiotemporal tuning properties of the functional domains in vivo and calculated expected response amplitudes from the model. The model accurately predicted cortical response patterns for two types of complex stimuli drifting at a variety of speeds. These results suggest that the distributed activity of primary visual cortex can be predicted from cortical maps like those of orientation and SF preference generated using simple, sinusoidal stimuli, and that dynamic visual acuity is degraded at or before the level of area 17.},

abstract = {Sounds commonly occur in sequences, such as in speech. It is therefore important to understand how the occurrence of one sound affects the response to a subsequent sound. We approached this question by determining how a conditioning stimulus alters the response areas of single neurons in the primary auditory cortex (AI) of barbiturate-anesthetized cats. The response areas consisted of responses to stimuli that varied in level at the two ears and delivered at the characteristic frequency of each cell. A binaural conditioning stimulus was then presented >/=50 ms before each of the stimuli comprising the level response area. An effective preceding stimulus alters the shape and severely reduces the size and response magnitude of the level response area. This ability of the preceding stimulus depends on its proximity in the level domain to the level response area, not on its absolute level or on the size of the response it evokes. Preceding stimuli evoke a nonlinear inhibition across the level response area that results in an increased selectivity of a cortical neuron for its preferred binaural stimuli. The selectivity of AI neurons during the processing of a stream of acoustic stimuli is likely to be restricted to a portion of their level response areas apparent in the tone-alone condition. Thus rather than being static, level response areas are fluid; they can vary greatly in extent, shape and response magnitude. The dynamic modulation of the level response area and level selectivity of AI neurons might be related to several tasks confronting the central auditory system.},

Among these, the population with the smallest and densest receptive fields encodes the neural image with highest resolution. In human retina, and those of cat and macaque, these high-resolution ganglion cells act as generic pixel encoders: They serve to represent many different visual inputs and convey a neural image of the scene downstream for further processing. Here we identify and analyze high-resolution ganglion cells in the mouse retina, using a transgenic line in which these cells, called &quot;W3&quot;, are labeled fluorescently. Counter to the expectation, these ganglion cells do not participate in encoding generic visual scenes, but remain silent during most common visual stimuli. A detailed study of their response properties showed that W3 cells pool rectified excitation from both On and Off bipolar cells, which makes them sensitive to local motion. However, they also receive unusually strong lateral inhibition, both pre- and postsynaptically, triggered by distant motion. As a result, the W3 cell can detect small moving objects down to the receptive field size of bipolar cells, but only if the background is featureless or stationary--an unusual condition. A survey of naturalistic stimuli shows that W3 cells may serve as alarm neurons for overhead predators.},

The orientation selectivity of dLGN cells was unchanged after silencing the visual cortex pharmacologically, indicating that it is not due to cortical feedback. The orientation tuning of some dLGN cells correlated with their elongated receptive fields, while in others orientation selectivity was observed despite the fact that their receptive fields were circular, suggesting that their retinal input might already be orientation selective. Consistently, we revealed orientation/axis-selective ganglion cells in the mouse retina using multielectrode arrays in an in vitro preparation. Furthermore, the orientation tuning of dLGN cells was largely maintained at different stimulus contrasts, which could be sufficiently explained by a simple linear feedforward model. We also compared the degree of orientation selectivity in different visual structures under the same recording condition. Compared with the dLGN, orientation selectivity is greatly improved in the visual cortex, but is similar in the superior colliculus, another major retinal target. Together, our results demonstrate prominent orientation selectivity in the mouse dLGN, which may potentially contribute to visual processing in the cortex.},

abstract = {From a computational theory of V1, we formulate an optimization problem to investigate neural properties in the primary visual cortex (V1) from human reaction times (RTs) in visual search. The theory is the V1 saliency hypothesis that the bottom-up saliency of any visual location is represented by the highest V1 response to it relative to the background responses. The neural properties probed are those associated with the less known V1 neurons tuned simultaneously or conjunctively in two feature dimensions. The visual search is to find a target bar unique in color (C), orientation (O), motion direction (M), or redundantly in combinations of these features (e.g., CO, MO, or CM) among uniform background bars. A feature singleton target is salient because its evoked V1 response largely escapes the iso-feature suppression on responses to the background bars. The responses of the conjunctively tuned cells are manifested in the shortening of the RT for a redundant feature target (e.g., a CO target) from that predicted by a race between the RTs for the two corresponding single feature targets (e.g., C and O targets). Our investigation enables the following testable predictions. Contextual suppression on the response of a CO-tuned or MO-tuned conjunctive cell is weaker when the contextual inputs differ from the direct inputs in both feature dimensions, rather than just one. Additionally, CO-tuned cells and MO-tuned cells are often more active than the single feature tuned cells in response to the redundant feature targets, and this occurs more frequently for the MO-tuned cells such that the MO-tuned cells are no less likely than either the M-tuned or O-tuned neurons to be the most responsive neuron to dictate saliency for an MO target.},

abstract = {Pathways linking the thalamus and cortex mediate our daily shifts from states of attention to quiet rest, or sleep, yet little is known about their architecture in high-order neural systems associated with cognition, emotion and action. We provide novel evidence for neurochemical and synaptic specificity of two complementary circuits linking one such system, the prefrontal cortex with the ventral anterior thalamic nucleus in primates. One circuit originated from the neurochemical group of parvalbumin-positive thalamic neurons and projected focally through large terminals to the middle cortical layers, resembling ‘drivers’ in sensory pathways. Parvalbumin thalamic neurons, in turn, were innervated by small ‘modulatory’ type cortical terminals, forming asymmetric (presumed excitatory) synapses at thalamic sites enriched with the specialized metabotropic glutamate receptors. A second circuit had a complementary organization: it originated from the neurochemical group of calbindin-positive thalamic neurons and terminated through small ‘modulatory’ terminals over long distances in the superficial prefrontal layers. Calbindin thalamic neurons, in turn, were innervated by prefrontal axons through small and large terminals that formed asymmetric synapses preferentially at sites with ionotropic glutamate receptors, consistent with a driving pathway. The largely parallel thalamo-cortical pathways terminated among distinct and laminar-specific neurochemical classes of inhibitory neurons that differ markedly in inhibitory control. The balance of activation of these parallel circuits that link a high-order association cortex with the thalamus may allow shifts to different states of consciousness, in processes that are disrupted in psychiatric diseases.},

To address this question we used neural tracers to label pathways linking areas involved in emotional and attentional processes in the primate brain (Macaca mulatta). We report that a novel pathway from the amygdala, the brain’s emotional center, targets the inhibitory thalamic reticular nucleus (TRN), a key node in the brain’s attentional network. The amygdalar pathway formed unusual synapses close to cell bodies of TRN neurons and had more large and efficient terminals than pathways from the orbitofrontal cortex and the thalamic mediodorsal nucleus, which similarly innervated extensive TRN sites. The robust amygdalar pathway provides a mechanism for rapid shifting of attention to emotional stimuli. Acting synergistically, pathways from the amygdala and orbitofrontal cortex provide a circuit for purposeful assessment of emotional stimuli. The different pathways to TRN suggest distinct mechanisms of attention to external and internal stimuli that may be differentially disrupted in anxiety and mood disorders and may be selectively targeted for therapeutic interventions.},

abstract = {We studied extra-receptive field contextual modulation in area V1 of awake, behaving macaque monkeys. Contextual modulation was studied using texture displays in which texture covering the receptive field (RF) was the same in all trials, but the perceptual context of this texture could vary depending on the configuration of extra-RF texture elements. We found robust contextual modulation when disparity, color, luminance, and orientation cues variously defined a textured figure centered on the RF of V1 neurons. We found contextual modulation to have a spatial extent of approximately 8 to 10 degrees diameter parafoveally. Contextual modulation correlated with perceptual experience of both binocularly rivalrous texture displays and of displays with a simple example of surface occlusion. We found contextual modulation in V1 to have a characteristic latency of 80-100 msec after stimulus onset, potentially allowing feedback from extrastriate areas to underlie to this effect.},

abstract = {We investigated the cortical mechanisms underlying the visual perception of luminance-defined surfaces and the preference for black over white stimuli in the macaque primary visual cortex, V1. We measured V1 population responses with voltage-sensitive dye imaging in fixating monkeys that were presented with white or black squares of equal contrast around a mid-gray. Regions corresponding to the squares’ edges exhibited higher activity than those corresponding to the center. Responses to black were higher than to white, surprisingly to a much greater extent in the representation of the square’s center. Additionally, the square-evoked activation patterns exhibited spatial modulations along the edges and corners. A model comprised of neural mechanisms that compute local contrast, local luminance temporal modulations in the black and white directions, and cortical center-surround interactions, could explain the observed population activity patterns in detail. The model captured the weaker contribution of V1 neurons that respond to positive (white) and negative (black) luminance surfaces, and the stronger contribution of V1 neurons that respond to edge contrast. Also, the model demonstrated how the response preference for black could be explained in terms of stronger surface-related activation to negative luminance modulation. The spatial modulations along the edges were accounted for by surround suppression. Overall the results reveal the relative strength of edge contrast and surface signals in the V1 response to visual objects.},

abstract = {The neuronal mechanism underlying the representation of color surfaces in primary visual cortex (V1) is not well understood. We tested on color surfaces the previously proposed hypothesis that visual perception of uniform surfaces is mediated by an isomorphic, filled-in representation in V1. We used voltage-sensitive-dye imaging in fixating macaque monkeys to measure V1 population responses to spatially uniform chromatic (red, green, or blue) and achromatic (black or white) squares of different sizes (0.5°–8°) presented for 300 ms. Responses to both color and luminance squares early after stimulus onset were similarly edge-enhanced: for squares 1° and larger, regions corresponding to edges were activated much more than those corresponding to the center. At later times after stimulus onset, responses to achromatic squares’ centers increased, partially “filling-in” the V1 representation of the center. The rising phase of the center response was slower for larger squares. Surprisingly, the responses to color squares behaved differently. For color squares of all sizes, responses remained edge-enhanced throughout the stimulus. There was no filling-in of the center. Our results imply that uniform filled-in representations of surfaces in V1 are not required for the perception of uniform surfaces and that chromatic and achromatic squares are represented differently in V1.},

abstract = {The sparse coding hypothesis has enjoyed much success in predicting response properties of simple cells in primary visual cortex (V1) based solely on the statistics of natural scenes. In typical sparse coding models, model neuron activities and receptive fields are optimized to accurately represent input stimuli using the least amount of neural activity. As these networks develop to represent a given class of stimulus, the receptive fields are refined so that they capture the most important stimulus features. Intuitively, this is expected to result in sparser network activity over time. Recent experiments, however, show that stimulus-evoked activity in ferret V1 becomes less sparse during development, presenting an apparent challenge to the sparse coding hypothesis. Here we demonstrate that some sparse coding models, such as those employing homeostatic mechanisms on neural firing rates, can exhibit decreasing sparseness during learning, while still achieving good agreement with mature V1 receptive field shapes and a reasonably sparse mature network state. We conclude that observed developmental trends do not rule out sparseness as a principle of neural coding per se: a mature network can perform sparse coding even if sparseness decreases somewhat during development. To make comparisons between model and physiological receptive fields, we introduce a new nonparametric method for comparing receptive field shapes using image registration techniques.},

abstract = {Sparse coding algorithms trained on natural images can accurately predict the features that excite visual cortical neurons, but it is not known whether such codes can be learned using biologically realistic plasticity rules. We have developed a biophysically motivated spiking network, relying solely on synaptically local information, that can predict the full diversity of V1 simple cell receptive field shapes when trained on natural images. This represents the first demonstration that sparse coding principles, operating within the constraints imposed by cortical architecture, can successfully reproduce these receptive fields. We further prove, mathematically, that sparseness and decorrelation are the key ingredients that allow for synaptically local plasticity rules to optimize a cooperative, linear generative image model formed by the neural representation. Finally, we discuss several interesting emergent properties of our network, with the intent of bridging the gap between theoretical and experimental studies of visual cortex.},

abstract = {The ability to process relevant stimuli selectively is a fundamental function of the primate visual system. The best-understood correlate of this function is the enhanced response of neurons in the visual cortex to attended stimuli. However, recent results show that the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure, also has a crucial role in visual attention. It has been assumed that the SC acts through the same well-known mechanisms in the visual cortex. Here we tested this hypothesis by transiently inactivating the SC during a motion-change-detection task and measuring responses in two visual cortical areas. We found that despite large deficits in visual attention, the enhanced responses of neurons in the visual cortex to attended stimuli were unchanged. These results show that the SC contributes to visual attention through mechanisms that are independent of the classic effects in the visual cortex, demonstrating that other processes must have key roles in visual attention.},
